2024-03-30,"Update to my post:  Found one that did something with the foam inside the little speaker canal. I did that too. It actually worked, did it on my Linkbuds S. Going to try it on the XM4's too. So now it's not happening (so I notice it) and feels ill having them on. This is still a hardware design flaw inside. By removing the foam gently (as it was possible) and pushing it down even further it help to stop the pinging resonance. NOTE: This isn't a permanent fix, since it can move itself again after some time. SONY has to fixed this intern design flaw. If not already with the XM5, then the XM6's.

Someone did a teardown of the buds and said: ""The spring noise is coming from the metallic shield in front of the driver, by pushing them you deny the shield to move and provoke the spring noise.""

My post:
If they still have that annoying hardware issue from the XM4 and Linkbuds S I've bought, this is a NO! When you have low or no sound, you can hit them while they are in your ears (or clapping your teeth together) to hear it. And no firmware has fixed it. I have no trust in Sony anymore after this. Waste of money, but I do love my WH-1000XM4! The WF (XM4) and Linkbuds S is amazing beside that hardware design flaw. But I can't unhear it, and it makes me sick to my stomach hearing that resonance thing or what to call it. The WF-1000XM3 was too big and clumsy, but they didn't had that flaw. After the in-ears XM4 and over to the Linkbuds S they just kept having this annoying flaw. Even got them exchanged, but that didn't help. I know I am not the only one, since I found others on Reddit with the same issue. Also calling it a hardware design flaw making that pinging resonance when you hit them or clapping your teeth. SONY!

2024-03-30,"I spend a lot of time studying at the university library, so I bought them because of the active noise cancellation, the portability and the promising sound quality. And honestly, I don't know if it is just my pair of earbuds, but the audio cuts out constantly, and it's fucking annoying.

By day 5 of usage, I started using my old wired (and way cheaper) earphones. Outside of the library the interruptions also occur, but with less frequency. Sony states on its web page that the problem might be due to slow Wi-Fi, but I've tried them with downloaded media turning off the Wi-Fi and they face the same problem. My phone is quite new (a 3-month-old Pixel 7), and testing them with my iPad does not give better results. I think Sony should advertise them as ""unsuitable for crowded environment expensive earbuds"".

2024-06-17,"Hmm. This is weird, as your experiences are _all_ the exact opposite of mine. I had XM4 which worked nicely, but I accidentally put them in the laundry and killed them that way. Then I got WF-1000XM5 about a year ago. I have between 500 and 600 hours of use on them by now. So on average 2 hours a day. During international travels I used them for up to 10 hours in one go, until I ran the battery flat and had to recharge.

* Foam and fit is pretty much perfect for me. No issues at all, apart from it being pretty shitty to clean. But this makes sense as every ear is different. Just wanted to point out your issues are definitely not universal. Have you tried replacing them with silicone tips? 

* Connectivity has been absolutely flawless for me. Android 14, Windows 10, Windows 11, Fedora Linux - all zero issues. Pairs at first try, reconnects as soon as in range. I now switched to the LE Audio Beta, got some troubles since, but I guess that's fine for an experimental feature.

* Microphone - XM4 Mic was atrocious. Since I got the XM5 everyone I asked told me my mic is great. I have not listened to myself yet, so no idea if that is true, or just the previous one was so bad they are happy I upgraded lol

* Sound... Oddly enough, the thing you liked the most was what I liked the least. I love everything about the XM5 _apart from_ the sound. Stock it is unbearably bassy to the point of mudding out everything else, and with a bunch of in-app-EQ they get decent, but still lack the resolution of the XM4. I was very happy with the XM4 stock tuning (slightly bassy fun sounding), but XM5 are a downgrade in that regard.

* Battery is fine. I agree with you there.

 microphone - xm4 mic was atrocious. since i got the xm5 everyone i asked told me my mic is great. i have not listened to myself yet, so no idea if that is true, or just the previous one was so bad they are happy i upgraded lol

 sound... oddly enough, the thing you liked the most was what i liked the least. i love everything about the xm5 apart from the sound. stock it is unbearably bassy to the point of mudding out everything else, and with a bunch of in-app-eq they get decent, but still lack the resolution of the xm4. i was very happy with the xm4 stock tuning (slightly bassy fun sounding), but xm5 are a downgrade in that regard.

 battery is fine. i agree with you there. despite specs stating the same runtime as the xm4, for me the xm5 were a huge upgrade, especially in ""passive"" setting (so neither anc nor passthrough) they run forever now.",negative,0.5195859670639038,-1

The foam tips are horrible for my ears; I have some silicone tips from another pair that make them a bit better but the size that fits best is not right enough to keep them in my ears with the weight of the body pulling them out.  

The connectivity issues suck — it defaults to prioritize connectivity over audio quality, but it still cuts out frequently.  Battery level, proximity to the case, phone charge, audio service (Spotify, Pandora, locally saved music, etc.) don’t seem to reliably improve it.

2024-06-17,"Some people have an issue with foam eartips. Then you should consider silicone tips. You'll lose some lot of the  passive isolation, but gain comfort, with the right sizing. Or perhaps you need more time to adjust and are sensitive not to the foam itself, but the pressure and feel of it. I avoided foam tips in the past, and thought I'd go with silicone tips once I received my XM4. But I was pleasantly surprised that they... we're not difficult to fit, though they take some pinching and heating with your fingers to initially compress the memory foam, comfortable, and did a pretty good job at passive isolation. I found a lot of silicone tips weren't particularly comfortable and offered almost no isolation. But they last much longer and are easier to just pop in your ear than foam.

Far as call quality, I found Jabra Elite to have good mics. But I wasn't crazy about their overall sound presentation or fit. Also have had Creative Outlier Air buds, and their mic was rather good, surprisingly, for the first time I had friends say they didn't know they were taking to me over earbuds. Plus longevity of the battery and sweat rating were all great, I've worn them in the pouring rain without issue, but the sound quality could use a boost, it's dated. Perhaps their new Creative Aurvana Pro with imems tech bring it up to speed with the competition. For good phone mic quality, thats where the apple's elongated styling, the mic stem, which many earbuds have adopted, but which I think are silly looking, do the better job at directing your voice to the mics, and if they have some noise canceling wizardry to help isolate your voice better from surrounding noise, helps too. There's as yet no perfect, does everything super, earbuds. After all, earbuds are a niche, mobile use case product. Some offer better call quality, others better music, still others best in class ANC. I didn't expect to go with Sony, but it ticked all my boxes.

2024-06-17,"For TWS, the Technics AZ80 and Sennheiser Momentum 4s for sound quality alone. With the M4s, the stock tuning is typical TWS (boosted bass, slightly veiled and dark), but with Sound Personalization it opens up -- tames the bass, provides much more presence in the treble and mids. It goes from a good set, to a great one. I'm fairly certain Sound Personalization is using a parametric EQ algorithm, rather than what Sony is doing with the XM5s, which is simply adjusting the 5-band EQ and Clearbass settings.

Out of 6-7 sets that I'm actually actively using from time to time and keep charged and ready to go, I'm going to grab the M4s most of the time. They're the best balance of sound quality and features.

For actual IEMs, current midfi picks are the Hype 4, Moondrop Dusk, Elysian Pilgrim, Scarlett Mini (EQ'd to the default Grand Maestro tuning), and Performer8. The Dunu Davinci is also great at $300; strong, impactful bass with good mids and decent treble. Have also rekindled my romance with the Dunu SA6 MK2, with the bass switches set to the ""off"" position (have run them set to on since launch).

Budget picks, the Pula PA02, Aful Performer5, KZ PR2 (w/ Mesh), and Wan'er.

Favorites of all time, Monarch MK2, Grand Maestro, and Elysian Diva (OG), Sennheiser IE600, Sony IER-Z1R.

Out of dozens of IEMs, if you asked me to pick one that works for the genres I listen to most of the time, it would probably be the Hype 4. With EQ, it got close enough to the Monarch MK3 that I sold my own MK3 and didn't regret letting it go. But if I didn't have an EQ-capable DAC I'm absolutely fine with the default tuning. It is one of the best IEMs for its price point in the last couple of years.

Sound Quality:  Comparatively - Blown away by the XM5's - clarity and EQ functions amazing.  Just really makes listening to music so enjoyable.  

ANC - Great - as good or better, recommend playing with the tips to get the best fit; it makes all the difference in the world.  

Best surprise and bonus feature:  I work in a hybrid situation - 2 days in office / cubical environment and 3 days from home per week.  The best thing is I can be simultaneously connected to two things (computer and phone) at the same time.  So I can listen to music but when a Teams or VoIP call comes in the music auto stops and transfers to the work call.  It is completely seamless and I didn't have to configure anything other than setting them up on Bluetooth.

I preferred the Bose for ear fitting, too. You have to really squash the xm5 in to your ear canals, and I am not a fan.

i preferred the bose for sound, they sounded deeper and wider. the xm5 feels brighter and maybe clearer. of course this is purely subjective and there are equalizers so you can probably adjust quite a bit. 

i preferred the bose for ear fitting, too. you have to really squash the xm5 in to your ear canals, and i am not a fan. 

the xm5 wins in size, weight, and the ability to connect to two devices. these were the reasons i switched from bose, but i'll think very hard next time.",negative,0.5676356554031372,-1

2023-10-09,"Sound quality is great, similar to Linkbuds S. I can't really notice that much of a difference between the two unfortunately though, even though the drivers are bigger on the XM5. You want to make sure that you use the EQ mode, because music sounds flat and boring if you don't set your preferred EQ. Also if you like bass the ClearBass +10 mode is great, just like Linkbuds S. But you will want to turn it to speech EQ mode for podcasts.

The battery seems like it would last forever, much longer than the Linkbuds S. I've never worn them this long but they would probably last 8 hours I'd imagine, with noise canceling. I have had zero battery drain issues. Usually I can wear them for 3-4 days for at least 4 hours a day before even thinking of charging the case.

The fit and the earbuds tips are the best part. The xm4 earbuds didn't fit my ears at all and I returned them, but these are perfect. The earbuds tips are a foam hybrid that don't need to be pinched before you put them in your ears, and seem like they will hold up in the long haul. And they give great passive noise isolation. This passive isolation strength means that ANC only adds like 10% more noise cancelling however, mostly at the very low end. You cannot block out people talking very well without at least 50-60 dba of some kinda music/rain sound effects.

Also small bonus tidbits:

I used them in light rain outside the other day and didn't have any issues with the touch pads accidentally activating like I did with the Linkbuds S. More time will be needed though, this is the only time I've exposed them to water at all. I found the Linkbuds S were unusable in the rain, or exposed to any kind of water at all, because eventually they just started pausing and activating transparency mode every 2 seconds.

Side tone CAN BE TURNED OFF in the settings which is awesome. You can also turn off the announcer/alert sound for activating various functions and changing modes via the buttons, which some people do not like and would love to turn off (I do not care). You will not find these settings in the old Linkbuds S or the WH-MX5.",sound quality great similar linkbuds cant really notice much difference two unfortunately though even though driver bigger xm5 want make sure use mode music sound flat boring dont set preferred also like bass clearbass mode great like linkbuds want turn speech mode podcasts battery seems like would last forever much longer linkbuds ive never worn long would probably last hour imagine noise canceling zero battery drain issue usually wear day least hour day even thinking charging case fit earbuds tip best part xm4 earbuds didnt fit ear returned perfect earbuds tip foam hybrid dont need pinched put ear seem like hold long haul give great passive noise isolation passive isolation strength mean anc add like noise cancelling however mostly low end block people talking well without least 5060 dba kinda musicrain sound effect also small bonus tidbit used light rain outside day didnt issue touch pad accidentally activating like linkbuds time needed though time ive exposed water found linkbuds unusable rain exposed kind water eventually started pausing activating transparency mode every second side tone turned setting awesome also turn announceralert sound activating various function changing mode via button people like would love turn care find setting old linkbuds whmx5,"sound quality is great, similar to linkbuds s. i can't really notice that much of a difference between the two unfortunately though, even though the drivers are bigger on the xm5. you want to make sure that you use the eq mode, because music sounds flat and boring if you don't set your preferred eq. also if you like bass the clearbass +10 mode is great, just like linkbuds s. but you will want to turn it to speech eq mode for podcasts.

You can't just put these or most any earbud tips in your ear, especially ANC buds; you have to slightly twist/screw them in snuggly and wait 10 seconds for them to conform to your ear opening.  Now, perform the seal test, it will let you know if one of the buds isn't sealed.  Once this is done, then the ANC can be graded. I give them a grade of A+.


Then select your preset or custom EQ stage. 


Unless someone has done all these steps, ignore their negative review of these Sony buds. They're outstanding.

I think they are a good investment.  
I use them every day, at work, at the gym, and walking around outside.  
I think the noise cancellation is really good -- especially when it is windy outside.

I have two issues with them:

1. The touchpads on the units (the little gold circles) are very sensitive.  I can't wear my beanie down on my ears because it will touch those touchpads and will pause the music or turn it off.
2. I often experience a lot of interference when walking around outside, in the city, around other people.   One bud will cut in and out.  I find it really annoying and have done a lot of searching on the web about what it might be.   It seems to lessen if I take my phone out of my pocket or bag and hold it in my hand (which I find very strange).   Also,  there is no interference when I am at the gym and EVERYONE has earbuds on, so I don't know what the ""interference"" is when I am walking around outside in the city.

The only difference is active noise cancellation which frankly is a feature that is way over overblown, at least with earbuds in my opinion. Unless you’re in a constantly noisy environment, there’s really no need for it.  You get plenty of isolation from noise without ANC assuming you have the earbuds inserted properly. I will say that the ambient sound mode is nice so you can hear (somewhat) what is going on around you, but I don’t think that alone justifies the difference in cost.

sound quality didnt really feel noticably better for the 4x price and the noise cancelling wasnt great either. moving around even slightly to briskly they would lose connection for like a second which was super annoying too.

2024-05-26,"Basically the app if you use it keeps disconnecting from the buds and then keeps trying to reconnect and this causes the bluetooth dropouts, even if it's in your ""recents apps"", so the best thing you can do is connect to the app, set everything thing up and then close the app and remove from your recents so it's not running in the background.

Another thing I experienced twice in the week I had them was the bluetooth disconnecting when the bud batteries dropped to 50%! Weird thing, but what was worse is the fact that I hadn't taken the case out with me (I never need the case with my other buds), so I was in Morrisons trying to reconnect to my phone but no fking chance mate, you have to put them back in the case and start the process over to reconnect.

another thing i experienced twice in the week i had them was the bluetooth disconnecting when the bud batteries dropped to 50%! weird thing, but what was worse is the fact that i hadn't taken the case out with me (i never need the case with my other buds), so i was in morrisons trying to reconnect to my phone but no fking chance mate, you have to put them back in the case and start the process over to reconnect.

Automatic connection switching between your devices. XM5s only support two connections, so if you’re like me and have a phone, tablet, computer, TV, etc., then you’re constantly repairing across devices. 

Spatial audio (including personalized for your ears and head tracking) that is embedded in the OS, so it works with only a couple of clicks. With the XM5s you have to enable a bunch of stuff in the Sony app (which requires signing up for an account), then turning on the setting in individual apps. Also iOS only supports spatial audio for video with AirPods and a Beats, so for video you simply won’t have the option. 

Transparency mode that automatically blocks out loud noises. XM5s don’t have this. ANC mode that automatically lets in voices (coming in iOS 17).  XM5s have this but it is imbedded within the app settings. 

Just in general, everything has to be done within the app instead of right on your system. Even checking the battery level of the case is a minor inconvenience lol. Us spoiled Apple people lol 

It’s nothing that makes them not usable - I still will be using these a lot, but that’s because I’m a headphone geek and am used to having tons of different devices for the sake of sound and even plugging in portable DACs and such.

2024-03-13,"I've been using them for about a week now and will say above all the sound quality and anc takes the cake by a mile, don't buy them for quality of life improvements though. Out of the box they sound lifeless, mess with the in app eq and they're the best sounding earbuds I've ever tried. I'm one of those people who has purchased and returned buds from many different manufacturers. 

I'm not an audiophile but I can comfortably say my ears are trained to distinguish high quality from crap and mediocre. I've spent a lot of time messing with the eq on these and have found the perfect setting (for me). I listen to a wide variety of music genres and they all sound great with these. 

I mentioned not buying these for quality of life improvements because outside of anc and sound quality these will honestly piss you off. The mics suck, google assistant integration is astonishingly bad (probably because of the crap mic) and the touch controls are annoying. ""Hey google"" voice recognition 8 out of 10 will not work with these properly unless you're in a quiet environment. By quiet I mean you're alone with no noises going on around you. This is actually my 3rd pair and they all reproduced the same annoying issue. When you do manage to get google to work via your voice or by holding on the appropriate bud it'll constantly get mixed up with what you're trying to say. For example I'll say ""send wife a message"" instead google will respond with ""which Mike from your contacts do you want to message?"" Or I'll tell google to play music by a specific artist or specific song and it will play something completely different. Performing the same actions with my phone mic works damn near 100% of the time. I'm not sure why Sony can't get their damn mics right but for buds that cost $300 it's absolutely unacceptable. I've used $30 earbuds that perform better.

The touch controls are annoying because skipping tracks or going back 8 out of 10 will pause the next or previous song instead of it playing automatically. So pressing twice to skip actually becomes pressing 3 times and going back to previous becomes 4 taps instead of 3. OR when it does work properly you're already so used to it malfunctioning that you yourself pause the next or previous track. I know that's a small issue but it's annoying after a while. 

I've seen a lot of issues from folks in terms of the fit but I've personally never had these fall out once. Vigorous head shaking, unusually large joker like smiling held in place for extended periods of time, chewing, talking, nothing makes them budge. The foam eartips at first will hurt if you're used to silicone tips. This sounds gross but once your preferred sizes become slightly saturated with wax they'll feel very comfortable. So in other words they require a slight break-in period. These foam tips also don't function the same as earplugs that protect your hearing for example. Those plugs usually take a long time to revert back to their normal size. It seems the stock Sony ones are meant to just shove in your ear as they revert back to their normal size in a split second. Other foam eartips function similarly to earplugs.

i've seen a lot of issues from folks in terms of the fit but i've personally never had these fall out once. vigorous head shaking, unusually large joker like smiling held in place for extended periods of time, chewing, talking, nothing makes them budge. the foam eartips at first will hurt if you're used to silicone tips. this sounds gross but once your preferred sizes become slightly saturated with wax they'll feel very comfortable. so in other words they require a slight break-in period. these foam tips also don't function the same as earplugs that protect your hearing for example. those plugs usually take a long time to revert back to their normal size. it seems the stock sony ones are meant to just shove in your ear as they revert back to their normal size in a split second. other foam eartips function similarly to earplugs.

looking past the annoying issues i say buy them.",positive,0.8717918395996094,1

2024-10-24,"So I read other posts (here or elsewhere, can't remember now), from others who called Sony and were approved to open a ticket.  Because it was such a widespread known issue, and a direct result of Sony's own firmware bricking the battery, other users were able to get their earbuds refurbed despite being outside the warranty period.  So I did that, Sony provided a shipping label, I mailed them in, and when I got them back, they've been working great again.

I did end up buying the XM5 because I needed earbuds for a half marathon I was running, and my XM4's weren't going to get back to me in time.  To be honest, I like the XM4's better.  They're bigger and so they fit more securely in my ear.  The plastic is also more rubbery which makes them easier to take out of the case.  And lastly I have no connectivity issues whereas the XM5's will cut out for a fraction of a second every so often.  The XM5's are too smooth and it takes some adjusting to get them out of their case, though sound quality and battery life are probably improved.

Whatever the case, I now have two which is great because I can use one as a back-up or something.",read post elsewhere cant remember others called sony approved open ticket widespread known issue direct result sonys firmware bricking battery user able get earbuds refurbed despite outside warranty period sony provided shipping label mailed got back theyve working great end buying xm5 needed earbuds half marathon running xm4s werent going get back time honest like xm4s better theyre bigger fit securely ear plastic also rubbery make easier take case lastly connectivity issue whereas xm5s cut fraction second every often xm5s smooth take adjusting get case though sound quality battery life probably improved whatever case two great use one backup something,"so i read other posts (here or elsewhere, can't remember now), from others who called sony and were approved to open a ticket.  because it was such a widespread known issue, and a direct result of sony's own firmware bricking the battery, other users were able to get their earbuds refurbed despite being outside the warranty period.  so i did that, sony provided a shipping label, i mailed them in, and when i got them back, they've been working great again.
