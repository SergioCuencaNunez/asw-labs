There is no way anyone in their right mind would choose this over a Quest 2/Pico 4. It's basically a lighter version of the Quest 2 for 3 times the price ! It's not even an upgrade, you have about the same resolution and FOV, same processor capability, about the same battery life and you lose the ecosystem and exclusives from Facebook.

 Do I feel like I got my moneys worth? No. I agree if feels cheap, it feels like they really didnt think about making this feel like a $1000+ headset, and its a shame, because it is so close. The software market is unacceptably small for the HTC store as well, it feels like this headset was abandoned before they even released it.

that being said. its pretty great at streaming PC games with out a cable and extremely low latency. I can play the hardest songs on synthrider and I dont have to worry about loosing tracking. and speaking of tracking, as much as I hate the feel of the controllers, this headset has some of the best inside out tracking I have experienced. I have never lost tracking on the controllers even when reaching behind my back or dropping my hands down to my sides.

This headset is also very light, my last headset was a Valve Index, and I could only really comfortably play for 3 hours before I started to REALLY notice how much weight was on my head. The XR Elite I haven't found a limit to play time yet, the top head strap makes a huge difference.

I’d owned the DK2 and latter the CV1, and while I thought both showed some promise, neither were a satisfying enough experience to keep me in VR.

It was a favorable review and got me thinking that the reasons I left VR, poor resolution, uncomfortable headsets, and lack of pass through, may have been addressed. 

This led to some disappointment when I learned that the Pico 4 was not officially available in the US, so I started looking for other options. The Vive XR Elite seemed to check all the same boxes, and while significantly more expensive than the Pico 4, I was sold on features the Pico 4 didn’t have like adjustable diopters and the ability to wear the HMD in glasses mode.

Entry level / all arounder

So if you currently don't have one, or never used VR the Quest 2 is a really great all arounder, and if the Wireless Airlink feature is as good on the Q2 as the Pro, it's really come a long way and is acceptable enough to use without compromising too much clarity, as long as you have a 5ghz network to run it off of.

Best for just seated simming

The G2 is another option, arguably the best for just simming but there are a few external factors you should be aware of.  At this stage of its lifecycle, it's really hard for me to recommend it at $599, it does go on sale though. There is one big asterisk with the G2, and that is that the cable is prone to failure, even the V2 (redesigned) one. This isn't so bad, except that HP wants $189 for the cable alone.

I suppose if you buy a 'fresh' one on sale, you will still get a years worth of warranty and at $299 or $399, for just DCS / MSFS it'd get the nod over the Quest 2 from me as long as you are comfortable with what I said about the cable.

Yolo option

If cost is no factor and you do want the all-around best, surprisingly it is the Quest Pro to me. I really didn't expect it to be the case, but after buying it to compare to the XR elite I'm going to keep it. I will say in this bucket of HMDs are ones like the Varo Aero, which I don't have any experience with but may be 'better' if cost is no object.  Like I said in the review, the display is mind blowing, but if you haven't seen it you don't know what you're missing. I imagine much of the goodies from the Quest Pro will trickle down to the Quest 3, which is positioned to be the general consumer grade one.

I was honestly shocked at how good the Pro was for gaming/general VR use given how it's positioned as a 'business product,' and why I never intended on buying one.  It was actually [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC-UQHDjf5c&ab_channel=LukasS.%2FWolta) from Lukas S. Wolta that even gave me the idea to buy a QPro off Amazon to benchmark.

>I find the way that HTC seems to react to customer problems very concerning

That is a big reason I took the time to do this. The MUCH shorter version I had posted to the HTC forums was out of concern the admittedly anecdotal amount of folks insta-returning this or having day 1 issues that should have been ironed out two generations ago is concerning. I think of Samsung / Google and how they will only try for so long, and just give up and move on. This is an expensive product, and I am legitimately concerned a lot of folks will be left in the dust on this based on early impressions. Granted, the only point of comparison I have is other product launches, and I can't say I've seen something turn so quickly once it got into consumers hands. 

&#x200B;

>My one question to you would be, how does the FOV compare to the Quest 2?

Simple answer: It feels like it's better than it actually is on paper

Longer answer: This is tough, for the reasons u/rapierarch said, but from reading your response you're well aware it's relative. To me, FOV much like the display is more than just the on-paper specs. Like any headset, if you pay attention you're aware you're missing the peripheral vision. This one is no different, but what IS different is that when this or any HMD really nails the immersion you kind of melt into the experience and don't notice it. Currently, just due to the Pro's rubber gasket add-ons there is more visibility out of the bottom than on the Q2, I actually like this because I can kind of 'turn off' noticing it when playing DCS, but it's handy if I want to peak out the bottom to hit a switch or whatnot. 

Like I said in the review above, the Vive XR for example feels much more narrow than the Quest Pro, even though it isn't - but that has a lot to do with the perceived vertical limitations. When I moved from the Index to the G2, the FOV difference was noticeable and took time to get used to. Going from the Quest 2 / G2 to the Pro, it didn't jump out to me as bad, kind of good but I do think that has more to do with the display vs the physical FOV.",thanks writeup bit sad hear suck almost certainly lead htc quitting space really thought winner medium coverage like said might last hurrah shame since competition know good x200b find way htc seems react customer problem concerning big reason took time much shorter version posted htc forum concern admittedly anecdotal amount folk instareturning day issue ironed two generation ago concerning think samsung google try long give move expensive product legitimately concerned lot folk left dust based early impression granted point comparison product launch cant say ive seen something turn quickly got consumer hand x200b one question would fov compare quest simple answer feel like better actually paper longer answer tough reason said reading response youre well aware relative fov much like display onpaper spec like headset pay attention youre aware youre missing peripheral vision one different different hmd really nail immersion kind melt experience dont notice currently due pro rubber gasket addons visibility bottom actually like kind turn noticing playing dc handy want peak bottom hit switch whatnot like said review vive example feel much narrow quest pro even though isnt lot perceived vertical limitation moved index fov difference noticeable took time get used going quest pro didnt jump bad kind good think display physical fov,"thanks for the write-up. i am a bit sad to hear that the xr sucks because it will almost certainly lead to htc quitting the vr space

i also saw the tide change just as you described but remained positive, since my use case was really niche (replacing the g2), and well you can read the rest above :) 

glad you had a good experience with the cancellation. the return process was \almost\ infuriating as it was just like, ""ok, mail it back here \\\\\"" no label, no nothing. but i did get a follow-up email from htc providing one, so they stuck the landing so to speak.",negative,0.6717990636825562,-1

Also dont think its a good move with fabric on the nose on XR Elite... why not use that very thin detacheable silicone gasket as they use on Pico4.. the only purpose is to light-block around your nose and not make it uncomfortable.

Is the IPD on XR elite locked with motors?..Im really not a fan of manual plastic dials.. as they will so easily move, and I will keep second guess if my IPD is still in the perfect spot.

\- and why the flying duck' dont MetaPro give you the IPD-value?  you could still let the user do the eyetracking while turning these plastic wheels to align with the feedback, but give the exact IPD-value as most people know their IPD, and it would be nice to at least doublecheck that the system is correct.

Pico4 approacch with individuel motors for each eye, and then you can dial them in software to your hearts desire  to match your known IPD.value and with 0.5mm graniluarity with 28 positions, and they simply wont move as the motors will lock them as it is all done in software..

\- and why the flying duck' dont metapro give you the ipd-value?  you could still let the user do the eyetracking while turning these plastic wheels to align with the feedback, but give the exact ipd-value as most people know their ipd, and it would be nice to at least doublecheck that the system is correct.

pico4 approacch with individuel motors for each eye, and then you can dial them in software to your hearts desire  to match your known ipd.value and with 0.5mm graniluarity with 28 positions, and they simply wont move as the motors will lock them as it is all done in software..

2023-03-16,"what makes tou think the MetaPro got depth correct cameras.

as a shareholder in Meta, Im pretty sure we still uses two B&W tracking cameras when it comes to the two sidemounted cams.

the only difference is that they are optimized for straight ahead and we get cleaner and more optimised data vs fx if it was in the periphel view, like on others..

you can see the early footprints..all our depth handling were intended to be handle by our ToF sensor. (Time of flight) and something we ditched in the last moment..

I dont have the partnumbers for the two forward mounted cameras, but I recall VR Oasis claiming it was simply 2 B&W IR cameras, and if that the case, then its the exact same as B/W IR tracking cameras.. and why you can get a B&W feed out on fx PCVR2 and Quest2.

2023-03-23,"> Seriously the quest pro is the stupidest device ever. I have it and use it everyday but it boggles my mind how grainy the passthrough is for supposedly a pro device?

The pass through is quite grainy but, it's the best in the industry for now. There's higher resolution pass through devices but, they lack full 3D depth. And no other device comes close to it's VR capabilities. The XR Elite is a complete turd of a failure, the Pico 4 has some of the dullest screens at less than 60nits and the color saturation is terrible. The Aero has high pixel density but very poor lens and poor FOV, no audio, no mic, and no 3D pass through.

>If only it were a whole lot clearer then the pro would substantially be better but. meta is too busy tracking us to care.

No, they just opted to choose to focus on better aspects of the passthrough, such as 3D depth accuracy, over raw resolution. Whereas others, like the XR Elite, focused on resolution over 3D depth accuracy. 

Pass through has very little use right now. There's almost nothing that uses it and no reason for it to be any better. In 4-5 years, when there's a lot of AR content, that

Huh? You sure you have a Quest Pro and you're not just looking for an argument? There's far more content using the face and eye tracking now than there is using the passthrough. Even foveated rendering even works with PCVR content now using the OpenXR Toolkit. Eye tracking is getting used a LOT.

Its the exact same approach as Pico4

passthrough with a single RGB camera, where you using B/W IR tracking cameras depth-values overlaid on top of the RGB passthrough, the only advantage metapro got,is they have dedicated two forward tracking/IR cameras for mapping' for a less contaminated depth information, but when you having such a inferior passthrough-camera quality, you are getting a worse AR/MR experience overall. (sadly)

and you as a loyal Meta-consumer, Im glad that you took the plunge on our product, but if you did your due diligence you would sense, it was intended to have a ToF, its not a lie or bullshit as you seem to think and all our big claims were centered around having that sensor..

Open up your MetaPro and you will see the big area where the ToF sensor should have been.

or you can just look at Ifixit teardown [https://youtu.be/LDUJLnrCgow?t=230](https://youtu.be/LDUJLnrCgow?t=230)

You need either Lidar or Time of flight sensors that constantly are poking your surrounding, to get a potent AR/MR experience with extremely accurate depth information, like you dont seem to know.

the problem  with these Black & white IR tracking cameras, is they are so sensitive to so many things in a daily household.

your LED lightning where many are pulse width modulated (PWM), same with your monitors or your laptop screens, also a flashing IR mess as  so many of them operate with on/off frequency modulation.

These B/W IR tracking cameras are also very sensitive to dark enviroment, or if there is toomuch light, fx sunlight that is plastred in IR.

So no, - B/W IR tracking cameras are not the best for 3D mapping, they come with many cons and why VR- is moving towards ToF or Lidar sensors for 3D mapping.

2023-04-04,"I am coming from an original Vive with deluxe audio and wireless adapter. I have had the XR elite for a few days and it is a keeper.

It has its issues but for me they are mostly software related. The app store needs a lot of work. Certain features could be more intuitive. It needs a native virtual desktop (it is on the way) and could really use much better 2d android app support. But these aren't the features that were determining factors for me. My primary reasons for getting it were it's size and portability, diopters, and native built in wireless PC VR streaming.

I understand many people have found it uncomfortable. I think this is just highly subjective. When positioned correctly for me it is perfectly comfortable in both eyeglass and HMD mode. The arm rests tilt up in the back for me a little and it cups the back of my head. In this position it just feels right. If I tilt the arms down towards my ears, like eye glasses, it becomes uncomfortable and the face gasket unsnaps. It isn't going to fit everyone perfectly of course but for me once I get it into the right position I could wear it all day.

On a good wireless network it is nearly flawless in wireless mode. I have several Ubiquiti WIFI6 APs and I can connect to my PC from all over the house. It is just as good as my Vive Wireless adapter with the benefit of being useable just about anywhere on my network. I know the tracking isn't as good as using the lighthouses, but it is surprisingly good for inside out tracking and I don't have to futz with setting the lighthouses up. The fact that I can just grab the XR and put it on and jump into VR anywhere is a game changer.

It is too small to use with eyeglasses, but my prescription is within the range that is correctable with the diopters. I don't have to wear glasses or contacts and it just looks perfectly sharp.

I setup a Hotspot on my Surface Laptop Studio and have a direct connection to the XR over WiFi 6. This works beautifully. I can just stick the XR in my backpack with my laptop and I have a whole PC VR setup on the go. The quick setup of the boundary make quick work of jumping into PC VR pretty much anywhere for me. I am surprised at how well this works. 

I can power the XR and charge the controllers from a portable battery pack I put in my back pocket. I can get several hours of use this way. My battery pack will completely recharge the XR and controllers from empty WHILE I am using it. When the pack runs down I just unplug it and charge it while I use the XR as I normally would. Once the battery pack is charged up I can plug it back into the XR when it's own battery starts to run down again. My kids and I were pretty much using XR wirelessly all day without issue this way.

I have had some strange issues connecting to the PC with the streaming app once or twice but restarting the PC solved this. When using USB streaming via my Surface Laptop Studio it starts to dip into the red for signal strength and Steam VR became very choppy. This oddly didn't happen when wirelessly connecting directly to the laptop's hotspot.  It could be related to quality of the USB cable but I suspect it is a software bug that needs to be worked out.

There are some strange choices and glitches in how their software works but once I figured them out I didn't have all the problems other people were complaining about. I turned off the dynamic image quality feature and just cranked the streaming rate to 200 Mbps and it looks beautiful wirelessly streaming. The original default settings are very blurry.

You have to turn off the controller compatibility setting for the controllers to be identified properly. Once I did this the controllers were identified and work correctly in most of my Steam VR games.

So far I am quite happy with the purchase.",coming original vive deluxe audio wireless adapter elite day keeper issue mostly software related app store need lot work certain feature could intuitive need native virtual desktop way could really use much better android app support arent feature determining factor primary reason getting size portability diopter native built wireless streaming understand many people found uncomfortable think highly subjective positioned correctly perfectly comfortable eyeglass hmd mode arm rest tilt back little cup back head position feel right tilt arm towards ear like eye glass becomes uncomfortable face gasket unsnaps isnt going fit everyone perfectly course get right position could wear day good wireless network nearly flawless wireless mode several ubiquiti wifi6 aps connect house good vive wireless adapter benefit useable anywhere network know tracking isnt good using lighthouse surprisingly good inside tracking dont futz setting lighthouse fact grab put jump anywhere game changer small use eyeglass prescription within range correctable diopter dont wear glass contact look perfectly sharp setup hotspot surface laptop studio direct connection wifi work beautifully stick backpack laptop whole setup quick setup boundary make quick work jumping pretty much anywhere surprised well work power charge controller portable battery pack put back pocket get several hour use way battery pack completely recharge controller empty using pack run unplug charge use normally would battery pack charged plug back battery start run kid pretty much using wirelessly day without issue way strange issue connecting streaming app twice restarting solved using usb streaming via surface laptop studio start dip red signal strength steam became choppy oddly didnt happen wirelessly connecting directly laptop hotspot could related quality usb cable suspect software bug need worked strange choice glitch software work figured didnt problem people complaining turned dynamic image quality feature cranked streaming rate 200 mbps look beautiful wirelessly streaming original default setting blurry turn controller compatibility setting controller identified properly controller identified work correctly steam game far quite happy purchase,"i am coming from an original vive with deluxe audio and wireless adapter. i have had the xr elite for a few days and it is a keeper.

On the Quest Pro the only comfort accessory I use is brackets to put the rear pad 2cm lower, which allows me to tilt the headset more, making the forehead pad distribute across a bigger area than it does for my by default, as well as add FOV. 

I find that when I initially put the headsets on, Q2 is more comfortable with all the pillow-y padding, compared to the Pro's hard padding. Also the Q2 has more pressure areas which means there's not one single area that's holding all the weight. 

However, after 15-20 minutes of use, the Pro becomes way better. Especially for me personally, the weight Q2 puts on my cheekbones (even with the halo strap) becomes very uncomfortable. The PU leather starts sliding around because my face gets a bit sweaty from the halo and facial interface contact. The Pro stays consistent all the time while wearing it. Additionally, because of the sliding around, the Q2 creates very slight additional eye strain because the sweet spot gets moved around for me. I never noticed this before getting the Pro where the sweet spot is basically the whole lens. 

The Pro is also lighter compared to my Q2 setup which is definitely noticeable. But that weight is needed to make the Q2 balanced, while the Pro's balance is perfect out of the box.

I have to say the Elite XR is the most uncomfortable headset (physically) I have worn, and my face shape is not particularly unusual. There is a general ""haze"" look to the image, and I much prefer the fresnel lens artifacts to this feel.

Also I am one who has felt that OLED provides the most subversive experience over resolution. The colors on the XR Elite are somewhat washed out and there is no real black (which to be fair wa the reason I returned the Index and why I still prefer the Vive and Vive Pro 1 over the Vive Pro 2).

I agree the quality of the PCVR WiFi streaming after changing settings is great (be sure to turn off dynamic nitrate, that really was messing things up for me). But the deal killer is still why I prefer base stations: the controller tracking. It simply isn't good enough. This is a general problem of all inside/out tracking hardware, and honestly the Elite XR is just about as good as any if not slightly better. But it just isn't good ENOUGH. And you can never drop your hands in a game because you will lose tracking, so you end up having to constantly hold your hands up.

And one final note: the buttons on the controllers are horrible. They have a soft, loose and clicky feel to them that makes them feel cheap and play is unpleasant. When I switched back to the standard Vive controllers it was like going from a cheap old car to a luxury sport car.

2023-03-30,"Excellent review. I'm still considering whether to return mine.

One of the reasons I got mine was to make it so I did VR more, out of convenience. But the thing is, it's actually easier to get going quickly with my wireless VP2 setup than the XRE. I've had to do room setup again each time, waiting for the device to start, taking longer, along with inconveniences like no passthrough in steamvr.

And the other half, being able to do *something* portably, isn't really there. I have a Pixel, so no phone share, and my favorite VR fitness app Audio Trip doesn't have a port. Maybe I can transfer movies to it or something but I typically need to do multiple things at once. A mere movie isn't stimulating enough.

I've had stuck pixels that have disappeared. Plus size is that I haven't really noticed any screendoor. Yet.

Besides that, pretty much what you said. Though as a developer, well, I haven't really done any VR dev. And if I wanted to, I have a Lynx R1 on the way. I'm not sure how the experience will compare, but the MR should be better. It's just that the XRE is very nicely portable.

Any more detailed thoughts on why specifically you think you'll be keeping it? Info on the dev stuff? I need to spend a lot more time messing with it, but I'm really pretty meh on it. It's really frustrating cause the hardware is like 95% there and 100% cool. It's just especially the software which is the issue. So who knows if it'll improve enough soon enough or not. Ugh.

2023-03-31,"I have total mixed thoughts about the XR elite.  I owed many headsets from Oculus to G2, Vive Pro,  Reverb G2, Vive Pro 2 and Pimax 8kx,   and a few many years back.  I've also tried the quest pro. 

After my first 2 to 3 hours using the XR elite I was pretty much dead set on returning it.  But, then I gave it a few more tries, and I'm leaning more towards keeping it and selling my Vive Pro 2.  

In terms of comfort;  it does have a forehead issue with some hard plastic mashing into the forehead. 

Sound is OK at best, it's still totally usable but not over the esr quality.  This can be fixed by using a headset.  

The diopter is a huge bonus, but I don't think they are accurate.   My vision is a -2.00, and I have to set it to 4 on the dial.    I originally figured I would only need to set it to the 2.  

The fov reminds me of the G2.  It was super difficult at first using the Vive Pro 2 and the Pimax 8kx as its tunnel vision.  I've readjusted. 

The controllers are meh!   I sort of got it working with space calibration with my knuckles and basestations, but for some reason, the program isn't seeing my 3 base stations at the same level.   

Also, I can't seem to figure out why most steamVR games don't even work with the default controllers.  SteamVR sees the controllers as cosmos.   There was a compatibility box in the VIVe controller options, but that didn't do much.  

The XR visual clarity is super nice.  I went back to my wireless vive pro 2, and I thought I had issues with my lenses as there was much blur in comparison.  It's night and day difference.

2023-03-29,">>Can you summarize the preceding post for me?

>The post is a review of the XR Elite headset from HTC. The writer reports that the headset's hardware was released before the software was finished, which gives it an early Beta/Late Alpha feel to it. They also mention that hand tracking inputs aren't tuned well, and the UI doesn't handle unintended inputs well. They also report that many apps aren't configured to work with the controllers, making the headset less useful. The writer goes on to discuss the PCVR experience and notes that the SteamVR integration is excellent. However, the streaming quality can appear terrible due to the default settings, and there are several settings in the Vive Streaming Hub that aren't easily accessible to the user. Lastly, the writer talks about comfort and hardware, noting that the pancake lens implementation makes the headset uncomfortable for most people. The top of the facial interface has a hard plastic forehead rest that kills comfort, and there's no angled cutout on the lens to factor in the user's nose. The writer suggests canting the lenses at an angle or dropping the diopter to improve the headset's comfort.

>> Can you summarize if/how the author says it can be made better?

>The author offers several suggestions to improve the XR Elite headset's performance and user experience. To improve the hand tracking inputs, the author suggests tuning the sensitivity of pinching and fixing the way the UI handles unintended inputs. Additionally, the author recommends providing clear information on how to adjust the streaming quality and making the default quality settings context and environment-dependent.

the post is a review of the xr elite headset from htc. the writer reports that the headset's hardware was released before the software was finished, which gives it an early beta/late alpha feel to it. they also mention that hand tracking inputs aren't tuned well, and the ui doesn't handle unintended inputs well. they also report that many apps aren't configured to work with the controllers, making the headset less useful. the writer goes on to discuss the pcvr experience and notes that the steamvr integration is excellent. however, the streaming quality can appear terrible due to the default settings, and there are several settings in the vive streaming hub that aren't easily accessible to the user. lastly, the writer talks about comfort and hardware, noting that the pancake lens implementation makes the headset uncomfortable for most people. the top of the facial interface has a hard plastic forehead rest that kills comfort, and there's no angled cutout on the lens to factor in the user's nose. the writer suggests canting the lenses at an angle or dropping the diopter to improve the headset's comfort.

 can you summarize if/how the author says it can be made better?

the author offers several suggestions to improve the xr elite headset's performance and user experience. to improve the hand tracking inputs, the author suggests tuning the sensitivity of pinching and fixing the way the ui handles unintended inputs. additionally, the author recommends providing clear information on how to adjust the streaming quality and making the default quality settings context and environment-dependent. the author also suggests disabling the compatibility mode in the vive streaming hub, which causes steamvr to see the xr controllers as cosmos controllers, and allowing the xr controllers to be recognized in games. to improve the headset's comfort, the author recommends changing the hard plastic forehead rest to hard rubber and redesigning the lenses by canting them at an angle or dropping the diopter.",neutral,0.7551771402359009,0

2023-03-30,"Interesting, your experience with the Wireless adapter for the Vive is pretty much the opposite of mine, though I've only been able to use it with the OG Vive since I don't have the newer battery for the Pro 2. I can't use passthrough at all, it actually crashes SteamVR if I try, where as the XR Elite has no issues using passthrough in SteamVR. With my setup, I have to wait a lengthy 30 second to 1 minute for my lighthouses to spin up each time I start SteamVR, where as the XR Elite is effectively always on standby and ready to just slide over my face. I also don't seem to need to reset my boundary unless I move to a different room; it seems to remember my room pretty well (I think they should add memory for multiple rooms though, as it seems to only be able to hold onto one space at a time).

My main dev reason for holding onto it is that it sends hand tracking to SteamVR, where as competitors don't, and I thought ""If it's sending that, maybe it will send Eye and Face tracking to SteamVR too when that gets released"", I also saw the shockingly void launch library as an opportunity too. A small indie game on a platform with no games is better than nothing at all, so why not try while I have the chance? I don't want this headset to fail, as I still think it's close enough that software maturity and a price cut could save it.

If this was the headset they released instead of the Vive Flow (reminder that the Vive Focus 3 was already out when the Flow was released), I think the shortcomings and empty library would have been easier to overlook.

I'm not in a position to get rid of my VP2 in favor of it, but that's because I don't have any other similarly premium options to lean back on. The FOV thing is just as you said, it's the same as the Reverb G2 and that's kinda fine. It only feels bothersome when you're used to unusually wide FOV headsets like Pimax and VP2, and you get used to it over time. I am concerned about how much FOV remains when the Eye tracking module is added though. Pictures make it seem quite a bit thick.

The clarity thing is something I noticed too. I had to second guess if my VP2 lenses were foggy when I put it back on because the XR Elite clarity really is that sharp by comparison.

2023-03-30,"Unfortunately after some more usage I really started to notice the screen streaks issue. I'm not sure how best to verbally describe it other than that it looks like when a screen is too cold to operate and starts glitching out or a failing cable connection, like clusters/groupings of pixels are crashing for a single frame. In standalone it happens only rarely, but when pushed on high settings in streaming it becomes constant, and as you said, it continues on into standalone until it calms down. If it is a universal issue then that might be a good thing, as it would be something likely to be fixed if possible.

I've never had anything like it happen before in any headset, so I doubt the screen itself is the issue, and the Focus 3 pushes a higher resolution so the processor shouldn't be having difficulties (unless it's an issue there too and we just don't know about it). Best case scenario is an OS bug that can be fixed with updates. Worst case scenario it's a hardware issue and no engineer tested it for more than 5 minutes. I'd hope for a recall if that were the case, but this is HTC so we can't bet on that.

i've never had anything like it happen before in any headset, so i doubt the screen itself is the issue, and the focus 3 pushes a higher resolution so the processor shouldn't be having difficulties (unless it's an issue there too and we just don't know about it). best case scenario is an os bug that can be fixed with updates. worst case scenario it's a hardware issue and no engineer tested it for more than 5 minutes. i'd hope for a recall if that were the case, but this is htc so we can't bet on that.

2023-03-30,"Thank you for sharing your experience more!

Yeah, my experience is pretty good, mostly because I got it for my VP2 in the first place (so it came with the 21W battery, plus I later ordered another bigger Anker one), and also because I ordered a fan to keep it cool. The most annoying part is how the antlers push into your head as you put it on. Plus the wait time for the base stations I guess.

Idk about your passthrough issue. What I do know is that I feel like I got the best working VP2 there is -- my firmware is marked as ""VIVE_Pro 2 PV"" instead of most people's ""VIVE_Pro 2 MV"". So I wonder if I got some early batch gold one, whereas everyone else got ones with poor quality control. Fun.

As for passthrough with the XRE, well, I don't get that button. And iirc my passthrough automatically turns on? I can't quite remember. I have no clue why it's missing.

I'll have to see if I can get my setup with the XRE to such a state where I can also hold it on standby to do that too. That's kind of what I wanted, whereas I do still have to plug in my headset and turn on the base stations every time. But so far, room setup's a pain. And I like the Index controllers better -- so if I ever get mixed VR working, I'm pretty sure that'll need setup every time, too.

>it sends hand tracking to SteamVR

Yeah this is pretty sick.

With this plus the other dev stuff you're talking about, I really think you should take a look at the Lynx R1. Especially for MR, but even as a platform for VR. The plan is to be a more open headset, and it's hand tracking controlled primarily. Controllers coming later. And it's the nice Ultraleap hand tracking. I'm pretty confident it forwards that data -- and if they don't, it's pretty much just an oversight. It would be fun to see a nice indie game on their store, too.

>I don't want this headset to fail, as I still think it's close enough that software maturity and a price cut could save it.

Yeah, probably. Most of the issues I have with it are software, and a bit of just high standards for XR in general. Though right now I'm particularly worried about a stuck pixel that I have right now -- and I don't know if it's the same one I had earlier or not. I really don't want to keep it with that sort of issue.

Even though it's pretty likely that the Bigscreen Beyond will get Nofio support, they're a completely separate class of headset in many ways. That won't have the same level of pop it on ability that this has, for you with the correct setup. But it should have a much better screen and lenses. Maybe I get that, but there's still the mobile uses for me. Which the Lynx could also replace. But nothing beats this portability.

>If this was the headset they released instead of the Vive Flow (reminder that the Vive Focus 3 was already out when the Flow was released), I think the shortcomings and empty library would have been easier to overlook. Right now they're playing catch up against a device line that's had two and a half generations, four years of games, and over 50 software revisions. I'm holding onto mine because I'm stubbornly holding out hope that they can do it, even against my better judgement. I also really want to play Yuki in AR.

100% agree. Except for the part where you're stubbornly holding onto it. They're a company, I don't owe them jack shit -- I'll spend my money if they make a good product.

For startups like Lynx, I can forgive a lot more. But not these guys. But I love HTC Vive far far more than Meta.

>My biggest fear is that HTC freaks out from the backlash like they did with the Cosmos and go back to avoiding Meta rather than competing directly. Meta doesn't want HTC to compete, they want them to die off. If HTC prematurely gives up on the consumer market a second time, it might actually happen.

This would be *really* bad. Their biggest issue with the VP2 was the lack of support and half assery of its design. It really could've been a big winner. Though a lot of people rightfully hate the lenses.

We have a lot of small companies fighting Meta, but the only decently sized ones are Bytedance, Valve, and HTC. The latter two are the only non evil ones -- and Valve only releases once a decade, maybe. We need revisions, nothing is ever one and done!

So I really hope they succeed. But that'll be merit, not me wasting $1.1k.

But what I predict the most likely scenario to be is that I return the current headset with worry of the stuck pixel, and buy one in the future, maybe. Unlike the VP2, I don't have a discount, though then again I will have my Lynx R1 sooner or later -- but this is more portable. It's hard to say. They just need to improve the software.

Also, I was looking at the 21W battery stuff for the wireless VP2 thing, and while the original battery I got seems to be no longer produced, [this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YPY31FL) was recommended and might work with 21W on the USB A QC ports.

2023-10-08,">The BSB and XR Elite are apples and oranges, quite different use cases.

The XR Elite has some very niche things that the 1/3 cheaper and superior in most aspects (Quest pro) can pretty much do. Maybe not switching batteries... and that's about it I think?

>Also, the tracking is actually really fucking good, I play a lot of games where I need to move my hands around a lot but also be really careful and precise and honestly, it never lets me down.

What is good now isn't the same as 2016 anymore. I had what you describe back in 2016 with the OG Vive, it took camera solutions a while to get there, and it still doesn't have a decent solution for full body tracking (if that is your jam) or has issues tracking your controllers when out of view (unless you are using a Quest Pro).

To be fair, nowadays is not a big issue, or something noticeable unless you are going to the absolute extremes. But again, every time we buy HMDs, we aren't forced to change controllers, or buy again a whole new tracking system of cameras and CPUs.

I really wish they had made the XR Elite a little bigger and made sure the base model had eye tracking with wireless compression guided by dynamic foveated rendering, that would've given it a clear edge over the Quest 3 and made it toe to toe with the Quest Pro.

That is exactly what I was discussing on a different comment thread.
The beyond is oriented to people that ALREADY have base stations. Most people that bought them back in 2016 with the OGVive,  or in 2019 with the index. That's why they don't even bother selling them in a pack with base stations or controllers.

Oh wow, people REALLY aren't talking about it in North America, I visit this subreddit every day and this is the first I'm hearing of it.

But ok, my prediction would be, after 2024, there will never be another hmd released, **at the consumer level,** that only has lighthouse tracking as an option.

Edit:

Wait a minute, even lighthouse tracking is only an option for the Meganex ""6DoF head tracking with Inside-out"", it requires an additional adapter that isn't even included in the box.

I wonder when they made this change cause when I first heard about the MeganeX a year or so ago, it was supposed to be lighthouse only.

I guess that's another sign the era of lighthouse tracking is coming to an end.

It actually was the other way around.  They wanted to make their own tracking solution, controllers and everything... but it just wasn't up to current standards like things like the quest do.
