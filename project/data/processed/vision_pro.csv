1-computing in your field of vision is amazing
2- the quality of whatever you are working on or viewing is excellent
3- the Spatial Audio is excellent, sounds come from wherever the source screen/app/window is. Music quality is very good
4-navigating the Vision Pro is intuitive and quick once you‚Äôve used it for a few minutes
5- movies on the Disney+ app appear in 3D
6- apps made for VP are easier to use and engage with than compatible apps
7-Vision Pro is heavy, with pressure becoming an issue on forehead and the cheeks

2024-08-31,"I think look-based UX is just as bad as it's always been. Meta's UX for controllerless input, while it is admittedly a bit floaty in its current form and has some trouble deciding what angle to draw the ray from, it is in concept significantly more friendly. There is in fact a reason why we've not all tossed out our mice for Tobi eye trackers. A pointing method divorced from your look position is just nicer to use.

And I'm sure with how much high end tech they crammed into this device, their implementation of hands as pointers would have been just as smooth as their position tracking, and way more reliable than meta's version. Keep in mind, this thing costs 8 times as much as a quest 3, so that's not a dig at meta, apple just has more data to work with due to having more and higher end sensors. As alluded to though, apple does have a stick up their butt about reinventing wheels all the time, so this is likely different for the sake of different, even though this is only different from other look based UX in that you pinch fingers to click instead of staring long enough for the circle to fill up. This is an upgrade on that for sure, but if you've got sophisticated hand tracking already, why only use it to simulate a mouse button and scroll wheel?

I think this was a mistake, and a missed opportunity to have the best controller-free UX on the market. Instead we have two unideal UXes; meta's, which is more natural but suffers from having not quite accurate enough tracking, and apple's which has high accuracy tracking, but only lets you point with your eyeballs.

For what it's worth, eye tracking is also significantly easier to do, and the quest three has their version of look based UX (the old one where you have to fill a circle to click) but it would take little effort to add a look+pinch mode that would be pretty much identical to apples UX.

VR as a whole is a gimmick, and is kinda dumb. The CONCEPT of VR is good, because it means convenience. However, currently, we just do not have to tech to make PROPER CONVENIENT VR. u guys know the Tony Stark Edith glasses? That is how VR would actually be beneficial. It would mean that the average human can just toss it on the whole day, and not have to have a phone, laptop, ipad, or anything. We probably wont be able to come up with that for at least another 100-200 years. Until then, in my opinion, all VR machines are stupid and completely a gimmick. GAMING is another talk, as i said, VR is a gimmick, and so if youre getting it for gaming, it is completely fair. Or watching movies, you are using a gimmick device to do ur hobbies, which is absolutely fair. But as of VR products for the next few decades or 100 years or so, they all suck.  Here is why they are gimmick:
1. Size
2.Battery life
3. Mediocre interactive experience
3. Price
All of those things are issues that VR and AR have now.
NOW, lets go to postive. THE ONE THING I APPLAUD ABOUT THIS PRODUCT, IS APPLE FINALLY GETTING OFF THEIR ***. Im just happy that they are finally making new things (yes i know this product concept isnt new, but it is a new product in apples line).  The vision pro has many innovative features which is great, because it motivates the entire market to want to innovate as well.

2024-02-03,"This is a great review. I‚Äôm having a tough time as a professional creative keeping this thing. Maybe it‚Äôs because audio doesn‚Äôt play through the headset when you mirror your Mac. Maybe it‚Äôs because of the fatigue. 

But I will say there‚Äôs one place where it absolutely unquestionably excels and that is if you are photographer and you want to look at your photos or edit your photos in a virtual gallery. There hasn‚Äôt been a headset high resolution enough to do this that was widely available until now. 

I was blown away by even editing photos on my Mac on this huge screen. It‚Äôs very impressive.  

But my professional work that makes money is video editing, not stills. And I‚Äôm really torn on that. My normal monitor is a 40 inch 5K wide screen. The virtual screen approximates a 16 x 9 ratio screen. So I‚Äôm actually losing usable real estate with the virtual monitor. 

It‚Äôs like you get to choose between screen, which is great for playback as you‚Äôre working, and easy on the eyes, or actual productivity. 

I also noticed that websites do not load the full version. I did a side-by-side of the Apple Vision Pro website on the Mac next to the native Safari, and two different versions of the site were loading. The native version was loading a more cut down version of the site. Like an iPhone version. I think.

If you buy this thing, now, it‚Äôs more for the future of it than the present of it. And it‚Äôs very very expensive for the future. 

I am extremely torn, because I love gadgets, and I love virtual reality and I love looking at my photos as a huge gallery. But it‚Äôs hard to justify the cost. 

Also, I own a quest 3 so most of the virtual reality aspects are covered by that quite nicely‚Ä¶ (the two devices are incredibly similar minus the Apple ecosystem, eye tracking, and of course the resolution which goes from ‚Äúgood enough/solid‚Äù in Q3 to ‚Äúman this is almost retina‚Äù in AVP) 

Meta really has done an amazing job for the price vs Apple. 

I will say as a mass market device there‚Äôs no way on this beautiful earth that this will ever take off at this price. As the OP said, the average person is going to be scratching their head. 

It needs to be iterated and cost reduced. But at least Apple had the guts to start. 

But it‚Äôs so beautiful watching movies and looking at photos. There‚Äôs nothing else like it‚Ä¶. Period.

I bought the Vision Pro and use it for seven hours total yesterday with the original band and had no issues with the weight at all. My neck did not hurt, and neither did my eyes.

Apple made the right choice ‚Äî if productivity software is coming to visionOS, it needs to be written from the ground up with the hand/eye tracking interactions in mind. iPadOS is a good base because the touchscreen design language fits well with the way Apple Vision Pro is interacted with.

2024-05-12,"> * It allows me to use my virtual PC screen (moonlight) to work with it.
> * I have multitasking systems with Telegram, Discord, Mail while the main focus is on the Moonlight screen.
> * It allows me to connect to SteamVR (PC) via ALVR. Yesterday, I spent about 4 hours in VRChat with the Apple Vision Pro and without controllers (using hand tracking to move).

As a long time VR user this is very interesting to me, as these are also the main ways I've naturally gravitated toward using it myself.  
&nbsp;  
The most remarkable thing to me is this: despite ALVR being really good now, uOLED and the optics being incredible, and having a convenient motion controller setup (index controllers), I don't play VR games any more than I have in the past (that is, outside of the honeymoon).  With typical VR I would always settle back to using it a few times a month, and that hasn't changed.  
&nbsp;  
On the other hand, with the vision pro I'm largely focused on using Moonlight (with, as you say, the visionOS/iOS apps on the periphery) ... but I'm often using it *every day* ... often several times a day.  In terms of VR headset usage, this is unheard of for me.  And with some updates, the Moonlight experience could easily be many times better than it is now.  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
The existing VR community has scoffed at apple for not having motion controllers and not focusing on high immersion, embodied gaming/experiences.  Moreover, other parts of the industry have spent tons of money desperately trying to force that kind of usage.  However, all of those billions have been blown in the face of stubbornly poor retention/engagement and for what is ultimately a very small active user base--it has been like towing a tugboat with an aircraft carrier.  Companies either give it a shot but pull out/scale back when they see the consumer's reaction (Sony, Microsoft, Valve, Bytedance), or they continue blowing billions in desperation (Meta).  
&nbsp;  
But the more I use the AVP, the more I'm convinced that form of usage is niche by its very nature.  
The AVP is simultaneously the first headset that I find these other more traditional computing activities to be worthwhile through, and also the first headset that I actually want to consistently use.  I think that once hardware that performs at this level and better becomes more widespread and once people naturally gravitate toward this kind of use-case, you will finally start to see this industry ""make sense"" and not just be an endless money pit.  
&nbsp;  
In the short term, Apple really just needs to:

* Improve comfort (sell a weight balancing headstrap now and fast track gen 2)
* Make visionOS more like macOS and not just iOS
* Embrace mouse and keyboard out of the box (look and pinch still being necessary for more basic and casual uses, like watching movies)

1. Whether this kind of computing happens with Apple or not, it will eventually hit the right price range and enough people will like it that the company can do a very critical thing that successful inventions in computing do and that help the audience determine if it‚Äôs right: Iterations. The iPhone started out as a hand-sized chunk of metal with a big touch screen. Had it been too expensive, development would have been too costly. Fast forward 14 generations and we‚Äôre far beyond caveman iPhones. Same principle. Say what you want or don‚Äôt want about Apple vision. A lot of us know that we want it to be Apple and we want it to be as convenient and explosive as the first iPhone was, but as effective, intuitive, and streamlined as the latest models. That‚Äôs not how evolution works though. The people paying for it are the ones helping the people who think it‚Äôs too expensive. If enough of those people wear it around town, Apple might turn over a profit and come out with a Vision 2 Pro, etc. So, either buy it, or talk about it and spark interest.

2. I think people need the perspective that the concept of evolution brings in order to be able to appreciate that some of the inconveniences, flaws, etc don‚Äôt mean it has to be a crappy movie without any hope of a series or franchise. Dune 1 wasn‚Äôt the most satisfying in some ways, but Dune 2 (sorry to fans, I‚Äôm talking about the most recent releases and not entitling them properly out of laziness) did a better job in some regards.

2024-05-13,"Developers are not obligated to support a platform with zero market reach and low sales. 

Microsoft found this out with Windows Phone restart after iPhone/Android smartphone market disruption and agitation. 

Ballmer is right, ‚ÄúDevelopers, developers, developers, developers!‚Äù

But why would a developer want to commit serious resources to a market that has no serious financial ROI and other competitors in the space are primarily secondary video game application devices? 

Oculus and Sony sell their headsets where most of the software is gaming related, and it‚Äôs not the full game but a limited, sidestory type of gaming application related to a franchise with a stronger base of sales on other devices. Resident Evil 4, wow. ONE AAA GAME, OMG TAKE MY MONEY! I already beat it 5 times on PlayStation. 

I‚Äôve had AVP for over 2 months. It‚Äôs mostly fruit slicing type stuff, and that‚Äôs not worth $3499. With market entry cost to consumer beyond the normal means of 80%+ of any consumer demographic, the entry cost to a developer is astronomical. 

It becomes a negative ROI opportunity cost, where just because Apple is asking for developers doesn‚Äôt mean any of us wanna waste time for 1500 installs over the next 9-12 months. It‚Äôs not selling and from what I have heard from some devs, it‚Äôs very slim pickings for growth. 

Even a communist country such as the USSR was damaged by supply vs demand issues, hence the Five Year Plans they never followed. And they eventually rotted from the inside from over supply and static demand, which caused monstrous losses to factories who had built more bolts that was necessary for a half decade outlook. Equilibrium was never reached and the market went wildly out of control. 

I bring up the USSR because Apple will have to FORCE developers to create for the platform if the dreamed of or hoped for customers NEVER SHOW UP. 

And as a consumer, the 10th time using the environments is a severe decline in joy. I have to turn it down to get up to pee. It‚Äôs sometimes loud and I have to turn sounds off, which ruins the experience. 

And 90% of consumers don‚Äôt care about or even understand all the technical nerd gobbledegook. 4k to them just means pretty colors. 

And then the moat damning problems:

1.	absolutely bizarre first gen product problems including no Handoff connectivity with iPhone such as unlock iPhone using AVP, a what the fuck question about text input and how ridiculously basic it is, a UI with multiple obvious UX design flaws that violate every basic rule in the paradigm including hovering UI prompts that obscure the very text field you are trying to type into (obvious QA fix six months into interface design)
2.	an App Store flooding with widgets. The Widgets feature of Tiger, Dashboard, was used so infrequently, Apple NEVER improved it and it became the appendix of the OS, before being removed. Some of these widgets are basic UI elements such as time, battery indicator, etc that should have been there DAY ONE, and not a paid app from a developer. This includes the ridiculous missing Beach from the environments, whate are the working on? The waves?
3.	gimmicky 3D movies that all I have to do is point to Universal Studios attempt to push it in the 1980s and it flopped so bad you only see 3D at an amusement park. Or I could just point you to 3DTVs, et voil√°. I‚Äôm sure we all wanna watch dinosaurs in 3D over and over again for 10 years of this product. Yeah, sure, we‚Äôre getting full content, oh wait, just a sidestory.
4.	overly zealous nerds who cancel naysayers so they can keep their circle jerking and persuade people to buy it who will immediately regret it right after the return window closes (me).
5.	competitors in the space have struggled to get to 5 million sold of their products over the last decade, which tells every developer and market analyst that this market is tiny, niche, and no amount of strapping a Mac to your face for $3500 is going to change that. Developers balk, and the product dies with gimmick apps that do basic UI functions that are mysteriously missing, or boring 3D gimmicks that wear out their welcome over time. 
6.	solipsism. The user is the only one who can see or interact with the device, meaning they have to buy one to join. And AirPlay mirroring to a TV basically just says ‚Äúwe could‚Äôve just bought an OLED 4k HDR TV instead‚Äù

2024-05-12,"I really agree with your thinking, in fact, I've explained it on occasion myself. Up until 3 months ago, we had a very specific conception of the uses that headsets should be given, mainly Virtual Reality. Meta has been reigning over technology in recent years and setting the course. But is it really the path that should be followed?

Then, Meta tried to launch something similar to the Apple Vision Pro with the Quest Pro, and it was a resounding failure (although for me, who still owns them, they remain a great headset).

Furthermore, we must add that the problem with Meta Quest devices lies in their own foundation, their operating system. Being based on Android, Meta Quest has a significant burden with multitasking, and as of today, it is unfeasible to create a multi-window system (it only allows us to display 3 applications on a virtual ""tablet"" without being able to separate them).

They have always wanted us to stand up and exercise, but if we look at the industry, practically the majority of the use we give to entertainment devices of this kind is while sitting: consoles, television, mobile phones, computers. Not to mention the productive side, where practically most of the time in front of a screen is spent sitting.

And oddly enough, in the past, technologies that tried to make us stand up ""failed"": Eyetoy, Kinect, PlayStation Move, etc.

It's curious that, for example, SONY with its first PlayStation VR wanted to force us to sit (also due to the deficient technology they used), but oddly enough, the Oculus DK1, DK2, and even the launch of Oculus CV1 were for that use along with an XBOX controller.

Although to be honest, I would like it to be the user who chooses based on the content created by developers how this hardware should be used.

Moonlight works wonders, it's really awesome, and I even like it more than Immersed (because it's an instantiated app).

it works flawlessly as far as lag and using the mouse and keyboard but the image quality is poor for some reason.   i've tried resizing it many different times but only the small section of the screen i'm looking at is in focus, everything above, below and to the right/left of where i'm looking is very out of focus.  it's almost as if there's a intentional blur going on but it's very distracting when looking around the desktop and at multiple windows.

has anyone else noticed this?

2024-02-02,"Okay, a little late here but I‚Äôve been using it for about 5 hours. I love it, but it‚Äôs definitely not perfect (yet, hopefully). FOV, a non issue. Weight, ymmv but I‚Äôve been using the solo band with no problems. I do have a red mark on my face but honestly I didn‚Äôt notice the weight that much. Eye tracking, you definitely need to do the calibration. I tried having a friend use it and he couldn‚Äôt select anything until doing a calibration. I still have some issues with selecting closer together items towards the top of the screen. Like selecting eye calibration vs hand calibration in settings. Apps, most work, some have issues. I can‚Äôt sign into Teams because Microsoft Authenticator isn‚Äôt compatible yet. It‚Äôs a pretty big issue for those who want to sign into enterprise accounts. VMWare Horizon client, keyboard and trackpad input appear broken once connected to a desktop. Can‚Äôt select or input anything. Signal, can‚Äôt link the device because there‚Äôs no way to scan QR codes. This is probably the most feature breaking issue. There needs to be a way to scan QR codes (and I haven‚Äôt found one). Many apps including others I haven‚Äôt mentioned I can‚Äôt sign into because there‚Äôs no alternative except for the QR code. Maybe Apple can use the iPhone to scan QR codes if they don‚Äôt want to pass the Vision‚Äôs cameras into apps? It definitely needs addressing tho. Overall? It‚Äôs miles ahead of everything. The interface takes getting used to but it‚Äôs smooth. The pass through is great, I like it more than environments. There‚Äôs minimal warping unlike the Quest 3 and it‚Äôs better quality. 

I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase and I can‚Äôt wait to see it improve as more apps are supported and the feature set grows.

Edit: to clarify there‚Äôs two QR code issues. Being able to log into iPad apps that present a QR code and log into apps that need to scan a QR code.

Edit 2: VMware horizon seems to be working now. Not sure what happened but I‚Äôm not complaining. The scaling in windows sucks but that‚Äôs not a Vision Pro issue.

I got home an hour or so ago and I gave up on the Solo Band. I couldn‚Äôt use it. I wanted to, but I couldn‚Äôt. It looks cooler, and more iconic, I couldn‚Äôt last more than 5 minutes.

As I explained earlier, and a little more below, this might be because the 33W that Apple prescribed me might not be the right Light Seal size. Just doesn‚Äôt seem right and I want to go back and test different ones. 

The Dual Loop is much, much better in terms of weight distribution. It took me a couple tries to tighten the upper and lower strap, but once adjusted, the Vision Pro goes on and off with ease.

I still think the Light Seal I got (33W) isn‚Äôt right for me. 

And the Apple recommended W+ Cushion makes it worse. When I use it, visionOS says that my eyes are too far away.

Furthermore:

- The passthrough isn‚Äôt great. It‚Äôs right around sunset here, and it‚Äôs really grainy and dim. Real world is like 50% brighter.
- I‚Äôm getting used to the ‚Äúbinocular effect‚Äù, although I feel misled by Apple.

2025-01-04,"I have my niche use case and that increase the total time spent using it substantially.  
Nowadays I use it during 3 days a week, for 8 hours plus on each of those days.  
I achieve this by either being plugged in, or having my ugreen nexode power bank 20k mha, 100w.

1. I don't like mixing work with personal life, as someone who still carries work laptop, work laptop  
but miss being able to access at glance my personal stuff usually meant carry double everything  
to have my music, documents, code, etc.

Nowadays allow screen mirroring in the same wifi network, and just share the work screen into AVP  
but all the surrounding windows are AVP windows and thus there is no data cross contamination.

2. I am quite picky on maintaining a portable workflow, thus when doing something I always prefer to work on the MacBook screen and only at best have reference content on the larger displays, this way, my workflow habits are always with me, window navigation etc. This for me can easily become a productivity killer hence why I opted for this. Similarly I had quite often struggled in moving between keyboards, same reason... and thus I used to religiously solely use laptop keyboard.

AVP allowed me to finally get the MacBook out of the center of the desk, I can reliably have a big display with me in a portable fashion. This was a game change for me. The now minimalist desk, is giving second thoughts to the monitors I have. 

This has already helped me do my soldering, and 3d print projects much better as space is less of an issue (I live in an apartment).

3. Finally some real 3D apps have been showing, with real promising, I started doing piano ""lessons"" on my keyboard, and there is an app Simply Piano which detects your keyboard and overlays the virtual keyboard on top of your keys. this is precisely what I expected from Mixed/Augmented Reality.

I also found that the djay is fun, incorporated with Apple Music, the controls are surprisingly precise despite lacking physical feedback.

4. Flying combined with AirPods Max is ultra delight. Perfect to feel less confined.

Things that are definitely not there yet for my intended use case:  
  
1. Text from Real World, id like it to be more interactive. I saw news about Visual Search, seems like there isn't such thing in EU. Having to resort at taking a screenshot then going to photos.

2. Text in real world that is not coming from a screen and is small is terrible to read. You need super bright lights to have a chance, despite the iPhone camera doing it just fine.

At the moment my workaround is screen mirror the iPhone to AVP and point it to whatever I need, if I will be needing it for extended period of time.  
  
3. Navigating outside, or even indoors, no ability to pin an APP to follow oneself is annoying to say the least, some data is relevant to be overlayed at all times, this for me would be a killer feature. While working, on a 3d Print, assembling something, this would be fantastic, to be able to have those references just there at the corner of my eye with adjustable transparency.

4. Flying is great, but content to be downloaded to AVP requires the AVP to be on. On a flight, it is still better to just use pre-downloaded content, and this means using the AVP for the duration of the download. There is no way to AirPlay the content from the phone, or allow it to read the data from the iPhone, nor turn on AVP without being on the face and instructing it to download.

5. App Availability is definitely low, but I think there is quite a bit of potential here.

the base m3 macbook pro isn't bad, poor research ahead of spending a shit ton of money is bad. this, more than anything, needs to be called out more often on this sub.
with even the slightest bit of research on youtube you'd know that the 8gb variant regardless of storage option on the m3 mbp is heavily criticised by creatives who would recommend getting either 16 gb over upgrading storage, going to the m3 pro if you're spending that much money anyway, or getting an m1 pro or m2 pro macbook pro instead of the m3 mbp with 8gb.",neutral,0.5472261905670166,0

2024-07-22,"Research before buying helps. Some reviewers are quick to champion just about any product they're borderline ""shilling"" for, while others will point out deficiencies. It pays off to be able to determine which are which.

The other reviewers I follow have been vocal about complaining that the base configurations are simply unacceptable for any serious computing beyond ""browsing internet, light office application use"" (probably best to use Apple iWork apps versus Microsoft's). What I call ""grandpa/grandma work."" 

As a companion to someone's iPad, iPhone, Ap(ple Watch, an 8GB machine will suffice.

few reasons are; that we don‚Äôt have a native apple store here, we don‚Äôt have the capacity to upgrade certain parts of the machine (i.e. ram, ssd, cores, etc.) we mostly have the built one on the apple store, in the base m3 case, either 8/512 or 8/1tb.

secondly; my original plan is to go for a 14‚Äù m2 pro mbp. the thing is there‚Äôs no brand new. my family won‚Äôt let me buy a secondhand computer for that much money.

third, i can‚Äôt also go for base m3 pro, the price difference here in our country is around
600 usd which is a lot given that we‚Äôre a third-world country.

lastly, i‚Äôm still a student so i don‚Äôt have much choice or money to choose whatever computer i want.

They made it heavy because it has to feel _premium_ instead of prioritizing comfort and lightness (same issue with the AirPods Max), they added features that add costs and weight and make the battery life worse (the creepy EyeSight) that for a significant portion of people do not matter at all. Also the FOV is not great either.

2025-02-22,"Haven't watched the video yet, but I think the long answer you have in mind is kind of beating around the bush and it kind of does boil down to this. 

I got a Meta Quest 3 that I justified as a temporary disability aid because I couldn't sit comfortablely at a desk for about a year due to a health condition. I used it for remote desktop/productivity and loved it. I am not a VR hater. I also didn't get it for games, so the AVP has some real appeal to me if it had been an option when I needed it. Here's why I think this product didn't succeed. 

1. Price - way overshot premium products in the category, and the leading product is being subsidized so it looks even worse. I would totally take an AVP over an MQ3, but if it was just twice the price rather than 7x I'd still be looking over the pro cons list and debating whether it was worth just $500 more. At $3000 more it's a total nonstarter. Even many enthusiasts don't necessarily like feeling taken advantage of on price.

2. The tech just isn't good enough outside of games to justify the tradeoffs. As a disability aid, VR was magic. Now that I'm able to return to a desk, it's a far superior way to use a computer. Passthrough isn't nearly as convenient as just not having a helmet on and seeing with my own eyes. I don't expect helmet like VR headsets to take off outside of games until it's basically a pair of glasses. Big Screen and Immersed are doing the same kind of VR with that size of headset. XReal is doing a different kind of VR also at that size. I think if you could make a self contained headset that can last 3+ hours at that size, you might minimize the tradeoffs enough to be worth it. I believe every headset mentioned has little to no onboard compute so they aren't succeeding here either. 

3. AVP wasn't designed or marketed for gaming. This is the one area where VR is super different from the alternative way of doing things. Watching a movie or working on a spreadsheet can be more fun in VR but it's fundamentally the same experience as traditional screens. VR gaming feels radically different and really wasn't part of tbe pitch to buy an AVP.

So why would someone buy this? It's expensive and it's not doing anything most people want. Even if it was cheaper I don't think that fixes the issue of not having a clear purpose. It would sell better because more people would want to check it out since it's from Apple but I don't think the daily active users would be in the millions. The tech just isn't there yet for being something people are ready to fully adopt, and Apple made this product in particular badly - it's far heavier than it needs to be, seemingly has vastly more compute than you'd need for what it's capable of, doesn't come with controllers, and has a fully external battery that isn't hot swappable. They tried to do the impossible and didn't even give it their best try.",havent watched video yet think long answer mind kind beating around bush kind boil got meta quest justified temporary disability aid couldnt sit comfortablely desk year due health condition used remote desktopproductivity loved hater also didnt get game avp real appeal option needed here think product didnt succeed price way overshot premium product category leading product subsidized look even worse would totally take avp mq3 twice price rather still looking pro con list debating whether worth 500 3000 total nonstarter even many enthusiast dont necessarily like feeling taken advantage price tech isnt good enough outside game justify tradeoff disability aid magic able return desk far superior way use computer passthrough isnt nearly convenient helmet seeing eye dont expect helmet like headset take outside game basically pair glass big screen immersed kind size headset xreal different kind also size think could make self contained headset last hour size might minimize tradeoff enough worth believe every headset mentioned little onboard compute arent succeeding either avp wasnt designed marketed gaming one area super different alternative way thing watching movie working spreadsheet fun fundamentally experience traditional screen gaming feel radically different really wasnt part tbe pitch buy avp would someone buy expensive anything people want even cheaper dont think fix issue clear purpose would sell better people would want check since apple dont think daily active user would million tech isnt yet something people ready fully adopt apple made product particular badly far heavier need seemingly vastly compute youd need capable doesnt come controller fully external battery isnt hot swappable tried impossible didnt even give best try,"haven't watched the video yet, but i think the long answer you have in mind is kind of beating around the bush and it kind of does boil down to this.

But the other streaming services all have apps.   and there are a plethora of vr180/vr360 players for porn,  the major ones have AVP versions (4xvr, moon, skybox etc)

I don't know what you mean by Apple being behind on gaming vs Linux - the same Proton solution exists for Mac so you can play Diablo 4 or Helldivers 2, and heck Apple even supports it for game devs if they want to port their game!  and lots of top games are being released for Mac (RE7 and 8, Baldurs Gate 3 , the latest assassins creeds, death stranding, etc).

who said you need safari to watch all media?  i mean netflix doesn't have an app on meta anymore either, so they want a browser.  youtube there's a great plugin to make the watching experience good.  but the other streaming services all have apps.   and there are a plethora of vr180/vr360 players for porn,  the major ones have avp versions (4xvr, moon, skybox etc)

i don't know what you mean by apple being behind on gaming vs linux - the same proton solution exists for mac so you can play diablo 4 or helldivers 2, and heck apple even supports it for game devs if they want to port their game!  and lots of top games are being released for mac (re7 and 8, baldurs gate 3 , the latest assassins creeds, death stranding, etc).  

i game all the time on he vision pro with a game controller - my ps5 xbox or pc games look and sound amazing.  and i have vr controllers to do pcvr streamed to the vision where they look incredible.

2025-02-23,"The price for cutting edge tech, in a vacuum, isn't even that crazy.  Let's remember that your average home PC in the early 90s cost $5k+ in inflation adjusted dollars.  Problem is in 2025 the VP does not exist in a vacuum, and people are already spending $1k on a phone, $1k+ on a laptop, and any number of other tech gadgets that these days are very advanced, of high quality, and provide lots of utility.  

In that environment, VP needs to deliver a *reason* for its existence, and so far there aren't many.  Apple is trying to define a new method of 'spatial computing' but so far has failed to really deliver a compelling vision of what that is.  Virtual monitors and 2D apps we can already use on our existing devices isn't it.  

Apple needs to lead the way with *actual* spatial software unbounded by application windows and traditional computing paradigms.  It should be capable of those traditional things of course, so it's a good foundation, but it needs to be a lot more.  There should be spatial versions of Final Cut, the iLife apps like GarageBand or iMovie, Maps, and new apps not yet imagined.  Of course what those applications look like, how they function, and whether they are better or more efficient than existing 2D applications are open questions and problems to solve.

The final and primary great advantage of these headsets is their capacity for highly immersive and transportive experiences. And here, Apple has made some headway but also remains behind competing products or justification for $4k hardware.  And in this case too, one questions whether people actually desire these kinds of experiences and value them highly.

Long story short, in my view there is still a lot of work on the software side before these products stand a chance of breaking into the mainstream.  Like, *a lot*.

But my original point was that the general public doesn't want to fiddle with stuff. Read your comment from the point of view of an average person. No Netflix app, needing a plug in to make YouTube good, having to use Whisky or the Porting Kit, or Crossover to play games (or streaming through the browser)... 

Doesn't sound so easy, does it?

You mentioned 5 games, but check the most popular games right now on Steam? Counter Strike, Dota, Pubg, Marvel Rivals, Kingdom Come 2, Apex Legends... Only Dota has support for Macs. Look at trending games, same deal. You get 1 out of 10 with any luck.

Gaming on Apple systems is subpar. And that's fine, we know what you get with a Mac. But the average person doesn't want to fiddle.

but my original point was that the general public doesn't want to fiddle with stuff. read your comment from the point of view of an average person. no netflix app, needing a plug in to make youtube good, having to use whisky or the porting kit, or crossover to play games (or streaming through the browser)... 

doesn't sound so easy, does it?

you mentioned 5 games, but check the most popular games right now on steam? counter strike, dota, pubg, marvel rivals, kingdom come 2, apex legends... only dota has support for macs. look at trending games, same deal. you get 1 out of 10 with any luck.

gaming on apple systems is subpar. and that's fine, we know what you get with a mac. but the average person doesn't want to fiddle.

with all these compromises, it's gonna be tricky.

The head straps that come with it suck balls.

One of them forces you to wear the VP like very tight ski googles. Which is fine for an hour or two, but after that it‚Äôs not very comfortable to have something so tight of your face. If you don‚Äôt tighten it enough then the weight of the device will sit on your cheekbones.

The other one belongs in the trash. It pulls the VP towards your face but it mostly is held up by your cheek bones.

Both of them suck.

The strap I linked is held completely by your head and the VP does not rest on your cheekbones at all. I regularly wear it 8-9hrs a day with zero issues.
