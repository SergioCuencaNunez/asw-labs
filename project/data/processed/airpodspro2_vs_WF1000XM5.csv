2024-05-07,"Ah the XM4s... I utterly loved these buds at first. Then the problems started...

Firstly, the tips. Although great, and very comfortable, they wear out and generally deteriorate very quickly. I went through all of the sizes in less than 18 months. Now, this wouldn't be too much of a problem per se if there were any decent replacements. I tried a few options and they either came off in my ears repeatedly, or were just generally uncomfortable/poor quality.

Secondly, the goddamn battery issues... I don't know if this started after an update or what, but it's gotten to the point now where they are essentially unusable. The left earbud lasts 15 minutes and won't go any higher than a 60% charge. Right ear bud goes to maybe 80& but lasts 30-40mins. I also can't get the case to charge properly anymore (very frustrating as Sony advise to update the software to fix this issue. A lengthy process that requires a fully charged unit :) ).

2024-12-22,"I will share my experiences with the sony wf-1000xm5 and the Apple AirPods pro 2.

I am an iPhone owner and bought the Airpods pro 2 because my work colleagues said they are very good. 
On the internet you only read good things about the AirPods pro 2 but I can’t confirm that. 
When I tested them the sound is just not nice. 
So sent back to Amazon because I thought fake or broken. 
Then I bought them directly from apple and the sound was not nice either. No bass etc. But I still accepted that.
Because I need a good noise cancelling for work.

At my work it is very loud (90-110db). Some work colleagues use the airpods pro 2 there and said you only hear a little bit about the machines. I took her to work and it was incredibly loud with ANC on. My work colleagues tried them and said exactly the same volume as with their AirPods.
The Airpods Pro 2 are not worth €100 at all. Who says otherwise are all apple fanboys. I have 3 year old Jlab Jbuds AIR ANC that I use at work and they have better sound and the noise cancelling is twice as effective and they cost 50€!!! 
If you don’t believe it, you can test it. I promise the jlab things are better! 
I listen to music with those at work with 50-80% volume and have to turn down the music to talk to work colleagues. With the airpods it is almost unbearable with the volume.
Now I have bought the sony wf-1000xm5 and I can say with a clear conscience that these are world differences. Sound is 3 times better than airpods and ANC works reasonably well. Better than my jlab earbuds.

2024-07-19,"I’ve had both and kept the WF-1000XM5. My issues with the AirPods Pro 2 were that they never stayed in my ears (unless I used foam ear tips), I couldn’t EQ them, their ANC was good but not class-leading, they don’t have true multi-point (Apple device switching isn’t the smoothest and doesn’t always work), their battery life is average, and their sound quality was just fine for my tastes.

Although Sony’s ear tips aren’t the most compostable, their sound quality and ANC are better than the APP2. I know some people are quick to mention the Technjcs A80Z or even the Denon Perl Pro for sound quality. But both their ANC levels are below that of the XM5 and the earbuds themselves are much larger.

I prefer having a compact package with top ANC and good sound quality. I primarily listen on my iPhone 15 Pro Max, then an Android Walkman when I’m at work because phone use at my office is being frowned upon. AAC through the XM5 sounds good.

You can also track the AirPods in FindMy (each bud separately as well as the case). For me, that’s reason enough to choose the AirPods.

Apple’s “one size fits some” approach to earbuds has never worked for me, even going back to 2003 with my 3G iPod. I had to put foam covers over the included earbuds for them to stay in (Apple actually included these with the iPod). Same when I upgraded to a 5G iPod and their slightly changed earbuds.

U can go for airpods+xb910N aswell but xb910 are around 4 years old model
Also airpods pro 2+ ch720 cost similar to wf-1000xm5 (around 300$)
It’s give’s u choice to use both as per ur need 
And believe me i found ch710n sound profile much better than airpods(personal opinion) 
ANC is better for airpods 
If u have budget for wf-1000xm5 check my recommended pair aswell

2024-05-20,"I'm iPhone and MacBook user. and I have got both SONY XM5, AirPods Pro 2,  I needed to sell my SONY for fitting issue nothing else. its personal case . if sony fits your ears good. it has got much better sound than AirPods Pro 2, but Airpods are so convenient with iPhone , MacBook what I mean is, connectivity, stability durability,  also AirPods' transpreceny is so clear no hiss, or any white noise. ANC I would say very close each other.. perhaps SONY slightly better. but not significantly. SONY's app and features so good.  EQ presets or Manuel available. AirPods dont have it. but AirPods better fit and comfy all day long .. and mic call quality better AirPods. if I was you.. I would go for Airpods unless sound quality is extremely priority for you.. if so then look IEM TWS none of these will satisfy yoıu for sure. :D if I need sum up between two ;

•	⁠ANC: both great
•	⁠Transparency : Apple far better actually best in market
•	⁠features extras: SONY
•	⁠Fitting: Apple
•	⁠Battery life: both great
•	⁠portability: both great
•	⁠durability: Apple

-sound quality: SONY far better. apple trash

-mic quality: Apple
