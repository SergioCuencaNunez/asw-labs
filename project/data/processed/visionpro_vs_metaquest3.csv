A bunch of the early apps really sucked either because of half assed implementations (see [demeo with no MR and sucky graphics](https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1cz0llx/demeo_game_available_on_apple_vision_pro/) ), but also because Apple inexplicably drastically limited the fidelity of hand tracking in 3rd party apps, which pretty much killed any kind of action game.

So it seems to me a combo of small user base, lack of commitment from app devs (which could be the small user base, but I really wonder why Apple did not directly fund a bunch of marquee apps - arrogance?), and some self inflicted wounds by Apple, have all led to a much less successful launch than could have been the case.

2024-11-02,"I thought the same question as you before I tried AVP. I had no interest in one, since their announcement, until an Apple employee, who did a retreat at Apple Park training on AVP, encouraged me to consider getting an AVP instead of upgrading my laptop or iPad, which is what I was playing around in the store over. He explained that Apple's approach to AVP was based on asking what's beyond the phone and the laptop approach to tech engagement with the world. He said Apple knows people don't want phones or laptops and that not far away‚Äîwe won't have them. He said people just want what they can do with them. So, Apple is trying to move beyond the phone and laptop to get to the heart of what people actually want from their relationship with tech. 

I did a 45 minute demo at Apple and there were a couple things that make it tempting to buy. You can turn any photo into a spatial photo and looking at those is a killer app (but still not ""starting at $3,499"" killer). But, looking at videos and Live Photos that were actually shot using Spatial Photos are incredible. And old photos, converted, almost as much. And I think old people will cry when they experience being able to be with their mom again.

The typical things look good...like movies or YouTube. But I think the fact that you can basically have a ""VR iPad"" or your ""VR Mac"" desktop 2D windows on the device is just another convenient feature in Apple's ecosystem. But these were just added little features to me.

What  I was surprised most by is the way the environments, volume, and eye-tracking works is also incredible. You can be anywhere and with just a half turn of the digital crown and just looking at the environmental rocker, you phase out passthrough and are on the beach in Bora Bora, alone, and the resolution's pixels can't be detected. You could be in a closet, a parking lot, or a messy studio apartment with roommates and it transports you to an open beach alone. It's incredible and was the first time in a long time that I felt creatively inspired thinking I could write my novel like this, dictating it, or using a hardware magic keyboard, which AVP can see even while in Bora Bora.

I'm not trying to sell it, but the killer apps are the way it transports you into different space and time‚Äîyour own memories and also to tranquil places that really calm you down and inspire. I loved the way time passed using it rather than using it to pass the time (or waste it like gaming for me.) 

Everyone on here is asking what can it do? Well, it really just gives you the space and peace to do whatever you want. AVP gets out of your way. It's more of a canvass with Apple's touch of aesthetics, which I've always thought is conducive to getting creative work done. And, I'd like one.

I have a Quest 3 and a Quest 2. They can be pretty cool and pretty fun, and I like engaging with others in Bigscreen (usually), but Quest is a toy (which is great). AVP is virtual reality for work and leisure and a great mixture of both since you can work on the beach. And Apple's eye-tracking is their next great user interface. To do the things Quest does well, I prefer the controllers and the pointing and clicking.

  
I think AVP is marketed all wrong. They shouldn't even show the device. They should just show talking heads of people saying what they were able to do with it.

AVP made me want to (and I have) started taking Spatial photos with my iPhone. You are going to want this. It's like entering a cutscene in a movie where there's a flashback looking at these‚Äîbut it's your life. It's going to change writing and filmmaking and blocking and the way directors see movies in their heads before they make them. The initial tries like  Apple's ""Submerged"" demonstrate some of the ways movies can be made, but the focus on what they CAN do also shows how badly many new films will be made to ""beat a dead horse,"" so to say, with the new types of shots that can be experienced. Not all drama needs to be or should be an audience-participating theme park ride. I like the voyeur aspect of watching drama. I don't want to be immersed all the time.

I also like the way you can set up windows in a room in your house for one part of a project and then set up entirely different sets in another room and then switch by walking to those different rooms! Instead of window switching on a Mac, you can physically move to another room in your house. I was surprised to see how active I wanted to be using it. I was getting up and walking around tables and squatting and standing and flailing grabbing space like an idiot and everyone was staring at me. Having to be physical with the Nintendo WII or the Meta Quest 2 kind of annoyed me and usually I figured out ways to just sit there and do minimal physical activity, but it's more fun and more natural to move with AVP.

i think avp is marketed all wrong. they shouldn't even show the device. they should just show talking heads of people saying what they were able to do with it.

avp made me want to (and i have) started taking spatial photos with my iphone. you are going to want this. it's like entering a cutscene in a movie where there's a flashback looking at these‚Äîbut it's your life. it's going to change writing and filmmaking and blocking and the way directors see movies in their heads before they make them. the initial tries like  apple's ""submerged"" demonstrate some of the ways movies can be made, but the focus on what they can do also shows how badly many new films will be made to ""beat a dead horse,"" so to say, with the new types of shots that can be experienced. not all drama needs to be or should be an audience-participating theme park ride. i like the voyeur aspect of watching drama. i don't want to be immersed all the time.

i also like the way you can set up windows in a room in your house for one part of a project and then set up entirely different sets in another room and then switch by walking to those different rooms! instead of window switching on a mac, you can physically move to another room in your house. i was surprised to see how active i wanted to be using it. i was getting up and walking around tables and squatting and standing and flailing grabbing space like an idiot and everyone was staring at me. having to be physical with the nintendo wii or the meta quest 2 kind of annoyed me and usually i figured out ways to just sit there and do minimal physical activity, but it's more fun and more natural to move with avp. i thought.",neutral,0.4978097379207611,0

- YouTube via Juno (in 4k), Apple TV, Disney+, Netflix 4k via Supercut, Chunchyroll HD (I don‚Äôt care for paying for 4k for animes, not yet)
- Books via Apple Books, O‚ÄôReilly books for development, Manga via Shonen Jump

- Apple Music (used to use Spotify via another app, but sound quality was just better on Music)
- SheetMusic, a music app I use for sheets, available on iPad and iPhone (I take piano lessons this way with the AVP and it‚Äôs incredibly useful via FaceTime as I can show my teacher exactly what I see, including my fingers pointing at notes on the app)

2024-04-25,"So I just purchased the AVP with 1 TB SSD. Sadly I will be returning it. Why? First off let me say, the AVP is an amazing product. At the Apple Store I asked about how I could incorporate it into my music studio. I was about to purchase a MacBook Pro with M3 Max 16 core processor, 2 TB SSD and 48 GB memory. Yeah that's overkill, I know. 

Anyway, someone mentioned the Vision Pro and after talking to the Apple sales guy, he said he thought it would integrate well with Logic Pro, Cubase, etc. He wasn't sure and their guy who really used Logic and other DAW's was off. I told him if it didn't it would be returned or, if it wasn't perfect, I would be returning the AVP. He said, ""I can't blame you there.""

So, here is my take. First off, it doesn't integrate with my DAW's. It likely will someday but currently, nope. That is why it is going back and I'll be buying the MBP 14"". The tracking/finger tapping on the AVP is superb. It's kind of freaky how well it works. It's also bizarre watching a movie on a huge screen, getting up to go get a drink while still wearing the AVP and looking over at my couch and seeing a huge display, locked in space over my couch. Cool but freaky. The displays are amazing. The gripes I have are, a weird halo around the edges of the displays that I would imagine is a slight reflection of the display pixels themselves. there are a few more. Apple chose to use the basic M2 chip, not the Pro or Max. Let's face it, this thing isn't cheap, why use the bottom tier chip?

I ask why they used the M2 because when you increase the screen size, a few things happen (in 3D movies anyway). When looking at the screen you  notice that everything ""off axis"" is a bit out of focus. As you move your  eyes to look elsewhere that ""cone of focus"" follows your eyes, but not quickly enough. It's fast and barely noticeable but it is still there. They need to widen that field a bit so that you don't notice and increase the response time. It doesn't kill the experience but for $4k, sorry, it shouldn't do that. Then there is a slight smearing effect, kind of like watching a football game on a 60hz refresh big screen TV. I understand that the AVP is processing two displays at over 4K each but at that price point I believe the better processor would be more adept at handling the task. Let's face it, the, ""fun"" is gong BIG in 3D. If you make the screen considerably smaller, it isn't an issue.

The other oversight, to me anyway, is there is no USB-C port for an external SSD (think Real Estate agents recording walk-throughs of his/her listings as the AVP records 3D video really well). The other is Apple not making a repeater Vision Pro. If the Master had a plug that you could connect to another slave headset that only had the micro OLED displays but nothing else, it would be a game changer. Then you, your spouse/GF, kids, etc., could watch the same program material together. Who is going to pay $4k +, for a headset for each family member? Even if they did, they won't be watching the same thing, in sync, at the same time. The repeater should be a lot less and lighter. Only one person needs to control it. (think your TV remote).

While it won't work in my studio, at least not yet, I can't justify $4k for a single use, stereoscopic TV/monitor. There are some great business uses for it (again a real estate agent, etc.) but for me, it would be a crazy ""luxury item"" to keep it. That being said, I will seriously miss it. This past weeks TV and surfing experience has been cool AF!

In closing, I see this device getting better and better. They have already added a ton of apps/features/games since most of these comments have posted. Some day I'm sure it will integrate into my music studio but by the time it does, what generation will the AVP be and how much better? I'll wait until that day.

in closing, i see this device getting better and better. they have already added a ton of apps/features/games since most of these comments have posted. some day i'm sure it will integrate into my music studio but by the time it does, what generation will the avp be and how much better? i'll wait until that day.

the quest controllers are great, love the haptic feedback and if the rumours are true about psvr2 controller compatibility for vision pro this year that would be great. 

i got a quest 3s to see how content i shoot for vision pro works on it. i was so impressed i‚Äôm returning it and getting a 3 this weekend. i‚Äôm surprised at how into the games i am. but when i‚Äôm done with those i‚Äôm taking it off and going back to vision pro to watch a movie or get work done.",neutral,0.4963894784450531,0

2024-02-03,"I have both. I was also one of the first 200 people to Kickstart the original Oculus DK. I have every Quest, HTC, and even a Pimax.  


The Vision Pro is absolutely a better visual experience, with the exception of mura. But for browsing photos and watching movies, it's top of the line. No, it's not worth \~$3000 more, but we pay a premium for that last 10%. It's just how it goes.  


The Quest 3 is definitely more mature, but the sharpness and contrast of the Vision Pro is undeniable. At $1499, it would be very serious competition. The outward-facing OLED is a waste of money and unnecessary. Just put a few LEDs on the front. The wired power pack is annoying and, especially compared to the BoboVR strap, the Vision has a weird fit. For me, anyway. Battery life leaves much to be desired.  


But you can see Apple is trying something new here. A computer system you can wear. It's not games forward where Quest excels. It's like the first-generation iPad. You can see where they're heading, and this is the end game: A lightweight, wearable computer that looks like reality with augmented windows and visuals. Now we wait for the apps to come and firmware upgrades. Don't forget home many quality of life improvements came after the Quest, Quest 2, and Quest 3 via firmware.  


For now, the Vision Pro passthrough is *good*. I said that a tad disappointed because it should be better for the price. Each eye camera should be 6K with better dynamic range. It's slightly washed out. And damn, that mura/motion blur is *distracting*. But I suspect 2.0 will fix that.  


In the meantime, developers will try it and figure out what innovations they can bring. Meta has, in a way, boxed themselves into a gaming console corner because of the price point and feature set. Sure, you have Virtual Desktop, but Vision Pro does that better (even though the mouse stutters when I share my MacBook screen.) The integration with the Mac (and Disney) infrastructure, however, is undeniably powerful.   


I love the Quest 3 and the price is fantastic, but you simply can't compare the two. The Vision Pro is looking to replace computers. The Quest Pro didn't come anywhere near as this.

‚ñ™ At the hardware level, I don't see a big difference between the two devices for now, except for some advantages highlighted by Mark (weight and cable) on one side, and greater interaction sensitivity (eye tracking and hand tracking) on the other.

If I were to think about gaming, there is no doubt that I would lean towards the Quest3 (for now), but for work, extending the space of my ecosystem (mac, iPhone), I would undoubtedly consider the VisionPro.

‚ñ™ Applicative ecosystem: There is no doubt that being on board with one's own account, with everything (photos, documents, passwords, contacts, devices, configurations, services), is a unique advantage and an accelerator of use and onboarding.  
‚ñ™ User Experience: The system of recognition, mapping, and scanning of eyes and hands is perfectly in line with Apple's style (frictionless).  
‚ñ™ Purpose and usage: This is an important point because each of us will use the device for our own objective, mode of use, and purpose. In the vision of the two devices, there is in my opinion, before they begin to converge towards each other, a different target user and a different vision of usage.

I said ""in a way"" specifically because of price point and feature set (e.g. specific gaming features, like controllers). If Meta releases a $2,000 Quest Pro 2, as you hypothesized, it's no longer the same price point and feature set, so sure it can do similar things.

2024-02-04,"That's a great question. What is a ""real computer""? It depends on your needs. Would I code on this? Absolutely not. At least until they had rock-solid keyboard and mouse support. If they did, I think it could work well.

To your point, it has a lot in common with the iPad. Right now, it's probably best for media ingestion.

That said, I know a lot of people who do professional work, like Procreate or writing, on an iPad. (With a Pencil and keyboard, of course, so there we go back to accessories again.)

Passthrough is *significantly* higher quality than Quest 3, but not perfect. I'm disappointed they didn't put dual 4Ks to match the quality of the screens.

For games, Quest is *absolutely* better today. It's yet to be seen how hands will work compared to controllers, but who knows what developers will do? It just came out. The Quest DK didn't come out of the gates with the best games. Everyone was drooling over around a blurry 3D model of a villa in Tuscany. 

Battery life is somewhat comparable, but form factor is definitely worse with the external pack.

passthrough is significantly higher quality than quest 3, but not perfect. i'm disappointed they didn't put dual 4ks to match the quality of the screens.

for games, quest is absolutely better today. it's yet to be seen how hands will work compared to controllers, but who knows what developers will do? it just came out. the quest dk didn't come out of the gates with the best games. everyone was drooling over around a blurry 3d model of a villa in tuscany. 

battery life is somewhat comparable, but form factor is definitely worse with the external pack.  


but, most of all, i think you're missing that it's like comparing a sports car to an suv. they're currently different use cases. sure, they're both ""cars"" that can drive you somewhere, so there's certainly overlap.  


but you know what i can't do on my quest? open my laptop and its screen turns off automatically. now, i have any size screen hovering over the keyboard. my 15"" is now a 27"" \~4k monitor. and off to the side are windows with my mail and text messages. in the background can be a movie or tv show. it's recreating the concept of the office space and how and where we use computers. next, wait for it to track your iphone so you have a perfect high-resolution screen. imagine dragging attachments and photos from your macbook to your phone with a pinch.

2024-02-14,"Hey. Good question. 

The AVP‚Äôs primary benefit is the whole ‚Äúspacial computer‚Äù aspect. It feels somewhere between an iPad and MacBook Air in terms of power. 

I was a bit disappointed at first, considering the price, but the ‚Äúah ha‚Äù moment came when I looked at my MacBook and it had a ‚Äúconnect‚Äù button floating above it. I clicked it, and the MacBook screen turned off, replaced by a virtual screen. And then I could resize it. My 15‚Äù laptop could be a 30‚Äù or 100‚Äù. 

Then, I could use various apps, dedicated or one of millions (?) of iPad apps. I could put Messages on to the side, Music or YouTube on the other side. 

It was like when I first got a second monitor but it was all virtual. Everything locked perfectly into place in my room (or a virtual environment). The hand gestures and eye gaze made everything more precise. I envisioned all the potential input hardware it might eventually track, from a Pencil to standalone keyboard (as opposed to a Mac) to gaming controllers. 

I felt, and continue to feel, like I can be genuinely productive. Not ‚Äúmostly productive‚Äù and trying to force it. I was answering emails and using my MacBook keyboard with zero trade offs. In fact, my screen was larger and decluttered. Anything requiring typing was on the virtual Mac display while anything with eye-gazes or swipes was off to the side. It was very ‚ÄúMinority Report.‚Äù

Another example is the taking and playback of spacial videos. It‚Äôs pretty magical to be ‚Äúin‚Äù a picture. Being able to take decent stereoscopic photos and videos in the AVP or iPhone 15 is very cool. (I know Meta quickly added the ability to view them but taking them is also important to me.)

There‚Äôs more but they‚Äôre related to the image quality, so they‚Äôre not particularly ‚Äúnew‚Äù but feel that way for me because I‚Äôm really into home theater. Having that 4K per eye and being able to watch stereo films in 48fps feels totally new to me, despite being incremental to most people. I didn‚Äôt love Avatar 2, but I never thought I be watching it at home nearly equal to a high end Dolby Cinema. 

Simply, with the Quest I‚Äôve always seen the future of VR, with the AVP I see the future of computing. Of course, the Quest has a bunch of overlapping functionality (and is really good at adding features) so it‚Äôs not so clear cut. Hopefully that example helps answer your question without getting into a spec/resolution/price battle.",hey good question avps primary benefit whole spacial computer aspect feel somewhere ipad macbook air term power bit disappointed first considering price moment came looked macbook connect button floating clicked macbook screen turned replaced virtual screen could resize laptop could 100 could use various apps dedicated one million ipad apps could put message side music youtube side like first got second monitor virtual everything locked perfectly place room virtual environment hand gesture eye gaze made everything precise envisioned potential input hardware might eventually track pencil standalone keyboard opposed mac gaming controller felt continue feel like genuinely productive mostly productive trying force answering email using macbook keyboard zero trade offs fact screen larger decluttered anything requiring typing virtual mac display anything eyegazes swipe side minority report another example taking playback spacial video pretty magical picture able take decent stereoscopic photo video avp iphone cool know meta quickly added ability view taking also important there theyre related image quality theyre particularly new feel way really home theater per eye able watch stereo film 48fps feel totally new despite incremental people didnt love avatar never thought watching home nearly equal high end dolby cinema simply quest ive always seen future avp see future computing course quest bunch overlapping functionality really good adding feature clear cut hopefully example help answer question without getting specresolutionprice battle,"hey. good question.

Disney is searching for the answer to make Disney+ profitable....what if they offer movie theatre, or slightly lower, prices to rent a film in their own Virtual Theatre environment? Not available under the standard subscription, but maybe replacing the DVD sale by offering this experience a couple of weeks after the film debuts in theatres?

There are big holes to fill here, but maybe Vision Pro is the marketplace Disney+ has been looking for?

Either way - I'd love the option. The things I want to be able to do in VR/AR:

1. Watch my own film/television collection, and live media on huge screens;
2. Inhabit 3D Spaces, either real or created;
   1. Watching live sports as if I'm in the crowd or on the sideline/touchline/rinkside/courtside etc 
   2. Tour areas of the world virtually in a semi-realistic manner
3. Replace a laptop
   1. Be able to create virtual screens (as many as I want) to work from in the same way I work on any physical computer screen.
   2. Play the same games I can play on a gaming laptop (and preferably more)
4. Do all this on a headset that I am comfortable wearing for 3-5 hours at  a time, and has a battery to last at least this amount of time while viewing media (streaming a film/watching a game/etc)

This would be worth somewhere around $2000 CAD to me.

I am not overly concerned who produces this - but I certainly think Apple are very well positioned to take advantage of their ecosystem, and their relationship with Disney to make this happen.
