First of all, I'm not in the USA. There's no official Apple refurbished market here. There are refurbished iphones handled by third-parties, but the quality isn't usually the same as if it was refurbished by Apple themselves.

I don't care for the camera (I find its post-processing awful), I don't care for magsafe (I use a non-magsafe wireless charger - four years, it's never been an issue!), but I care with having oled (the main reason I picked the 12 instead of the 11), Face ID and the operating system itself.
While I don't find the 16E specifically tempting to me, because I'm not looking to replace my phone now, I'll probably love, for instance, a 17E or 18E, when the time comes.

1) I always use a case. And I am sure, people, who buy SE/E, intend to use their phones for years and also use cases to prolong devices' service span. I do not need the alignment magnets to be built in the phone. Moreover, I don't want them on my phone: I want to get a bigger battery and less weight instead. And moreover, I probably don't need inductive charging at all: I have it on my phone, I have a charger, and never use it.

2) I have a wide-lens camera, and I used it two times to shoot room interior. But I always miss the telephoto lens. Do you really need the wide-lens?

3) I never bought used phones. I don't want to use a refurbished/used phone: seals are compromised, PCBs already have micro cracks, some elements are corroded. And software/firmware may be maliciously modified. Comparison of a new phone with a used is not legit.

The only reason to have an iPhone in a drawer is Airtags tracking and spotting. Android analogues don't have enough participants in peer grids to provide the same coverage and precision. And the iPhone 16E doesn't have the spotting hardware.

Give me one android phone under 600 usd that can click pictures and videos as good as iphone 16e. I'll wait. 

No phone is perfect. Yes this phone has some glaring misses too. But Apple has come up with a device that gets the basics right at a relatively affordable price point. 

'e' stands for essential, as I understand. 

120 HZ -> NOT essential. 
Magsafe -> NOT essential.
Ultrawide camera -> NOT essential. 
UWB -> NOT essential

Best in class modem for great network reception -> ESSENTIAL
Excellent Battery life -> ESSENTIAL

So called Tech nerds will never understand this because they have no clue what the masses really want. 

Apple knows it.",people whore criticising ijustine review give one android phone 600 usd click picture video good iphone 16e ill wait phone perfect yes phone glaring miss apple come device get basic right relatively affordable price point stand essential understand 120 essential magsafe essential ultrawide camera essential uwb essential best class modem great network reception essential excellent battery life essential called tech nerd never understand clue mass really want apple know,"people who're criticising ijustine for this review.

give me one android phone under 600 usd that can click pictures and videos as good as iphone 16e. i'll wait. 

no phone is perfect. yes this phone has some glaring misses too. but apple has come up with a device that gets the basics right at a relatively affordable price point. 

'e' stands for essential, as i understand. 

120 hz - not essential. 
magsafe - not essential.
ultrawide camera - not essential. 
uwb - not essential

best in class modem for great network reception - essential
excellent battery life - essential

2025-02-20,"The iPhone 16e isn’t a bad phone… it’s a bad value. 

Since 2016, Apple has been giving us the iPhone SE, a $399 parts binned iPhone to get the android users into the Apple ecosystem. The issue at time was that since it was a parts binned phone, it looked dated even though it had their fastest SOC of that time in it. It was a great budget offering by Apple to be a gateway device into the Apple Ecosystem. Further they increased the price of the iPhone SE3 to $429 in 2022. No Biggie.

With the launch of the iPhone 16e, the “SUCCESSOR” of the iPhone SE series, Apple lost the game big time. First, they killed both the iPhone SE series and the iPhone 14 series and positioned (price-wise) the iPhone 16e at $599 which was the price of the iPhone 14 a day before. With the removal of the iPhone SE series the entry price to the Apple ecosystem starts at $599. 

Now starting at $599 isn’t a bad thing at all, the issue is that Apple is giving it a bad value. Apple has positioned the iPhone 16e as a Price Anchor just to make the value of the iPhone 15 series and iPhone 16 series that much more attractive. Apple wants us to compare it with the iPhone SE, but it’s true comparison should be with the iPhone 14 which the iPhone 16e is a Price Replacement of. Comparison with the iPhone 14:

Now with these comparisons out of the way, the iPhone 16e isn’t looking too good especially which kept against the iPhone 14 that it’s directly replacing in terms of price. The iPhone 15 at $699, which is $100 more than the iPhone 16e looks really tempting while keeping in mind the it being a 18 month old phone comes with Apple’s A16 SOC compared to iPhone 16e’s A18 SOC and No Apple Intelligence Features. It further looks even more appealing when compared against the iPhone 16 at $799, a $200 price jump. You for sure are getting a lot for $200 more.The iPhone 16e is in no way a BAD PHONE, it’s NOT a phone that no one should buy, it’s just a terrible value. There have been a lot of corners cut to make it a distinct downgrade from the iPhone 16 and the price hasn’t come down accordingly. This exact same phone at $499 would have been an excellent deal and Apple would have had another Mac Mini M4 moment. At $599, it just too expensive for the amount of features missing. On a brighter note, It might have the longest battery life amongst the iPhone 16 series.Would I recommend the iPhone 16e? For most people, No! It’s absolutely not worth it. However I would recommend this iPhone for the elders in your family, the people who need longer battery life, longer support life with software updates, for those who have gotten used to iOS and who use an iPhone only for FaceTime or iMessages and would find it hard to migrate to Android. To everyone else, It’s just not worth it. If you’re on a tight budget and absolutely need an iPhone, I would highly recommend that you check third-party stores, as they’ll be clearing out their iPhone 14 series stock and maybe you could get it at an even cheaper price. For the rest of you who need an upgrade or a new iPhone, (I can’t believe Apple’s price Anchor strategy is working here) I suggest you save a little more and go for the iPhone 16, It’s a way better deal as compared to the iPhone 16e.

Finally I’ll end with a prediction, The next iPhone in Apple’s ‘e’ series, presumably iPhone 17e would come back to earth with it’s pricing to $499, and Apple is gonna use it a selling point. “Apple’s Most Affordable iPhone, Now Even Cheaper” or something cheesy like that.",iphone 16e isnt bad phone bad value since 2016 apple giving iphone 399 part binned iphone get android user apple ecosystem issue time since part binned phone looked dated even though fastest soc time great budget offering apple gateway device apple ecosystem increased price iphone se3 429 2022 biggie launch iphone 16e successor iphone series apple lost game big time first killed iphone series iphone series positioned pricewise iphone 16e 599 price iphone day removal iphone series entry price apple ecosystem start 599 starting 599 isnt bad thing issue apple giving bad value apple positioned iphone 16e price anchor make value iphone series iphone series much attractive apple want compare iphone true comparison iphone iphone 16e price replacement comparison iphone magsafe ultrawide camera macro photography cinematic mode action mode sensor shift optical image stabilization le gpu core watt wireless charging ultra wideband chip millimeter wave band supported color option black white a18 soc usb typec action button a18 soc comparison iphone 100 magsafe ultrawide camera macro photography cinematic mode action mode sensor shift optical image stabilization le gpu core watt wireless charging ultra wideband chip millimeter wave band supported color option black white lower max brightness wifi support dynamic island thread networking support a18 soc comparison iphone 200 magsafe ultrawide camera macro photography cinematic mode action mode sensor shift optical image stabilization le gpu core watt wireless charging ultra wideband chip millimeter wave band supported color option black white lower max brightness wifi support dynamic island thread networking support camera control button photographic style higher minimum brightness spacial photovideo last generation ceramic shield comparison way iphone 16e isnt looking good especially kept iphone directly replacing term price iphone 699 100 iphone 16e look really tempting keeping mind month old phone come apple a16 soc compared iphone 16es a18 soc apple intelligence feature look even appealing compared iphone 799 200 price jump sure getting lot 200 morethe iphone 16e way bad phone phone one buy terrible value lot corner cut make distinct downgrade iphone price hasnt come accordingly exact phone 499 would excellent deal apple would another mac mini moment 599 expensive amount feature missing brighter note might longest battery life amongst iphone serieswould recommend iphone 16e people absolutely worth however would recommend iphone elder family people need longer battery life longer support life software update gotten used io use iphone facetime imessages would find hard migrate android everyone else worth youre tight budget absolutely need iphone would highly recommend check thirdparty store theyll clearing iphone series stock maybe could get even cheaper price rest need upgrade new iphone cant believe apple price anchor strategy working suggest save little iphone way better deal compared iphone 16e finally ill end prediction next iphone apple series presumably iphone 17e would come back earth pricing 499 apple gon use selling point apple affordable iphone even cheaper something cheesy like,"the iphone 16e isn’t a bad phone… it’s a bad value.

now with these comparisons out of the way, the iphone 16e isn’t looking too good especially which kept against the iphone 14 that it’s directly replacing in terms of price. the iphone 15 at $699, which is $100 more than the iphone 16e looks really tempting while keeping in mind the it being a 18 month old phone comes with apple’s a16 soc compared to iphone 16e’s a18 soc and no apple intelligence features. it further looks even more appealing when compared against the iphone 16 at $799, a $200 price jump. you for sure are getting a lot for $200 more.the iphone 16e is in no way a bad phone, it’s not a phone that no one should buy, it’s just a terrible value. there have been a lot of corners cut to make it a distinct downgrade from the iphone 16 and the price hasn’t come down accordingly. this exact same phone at $499 would have been an excellent deal and apple would have had another mac mini m4 moment. at $599, it just too expensive for the amount of features missing. on a brighter note, it might have the longest battery life amongst the iphone 16 series.would i recommend the iphone 16e? for most people, no! it’s absolutely not worth it. however i would recommend this iphone for the elders in your family, the people who need longer battery life, longer support life with software updates, for those who have gotten used to ios and who use an iphone only for facetime or imessages and would find it hard to migrate to android. to everyone else, it’s just not worth it. if you’re on a tight budget and absolutely need an iphone, i would highly recommend that you check third-party stores, as they’ll be clearing out their iphone 14 series stock and maybe you could get it at an even cheaper price. for the rest of you who need an upgrade or a new iphone, (i can’t believe apple’s price anchor strategy is working here) i suggest you save a little more and go for the iphone 16, it’s a way better deal as compared to the iphone 16e.

finally i’ll end with a prediction, the next iphone in apple’s ‘e’ series, presumably iphone 17e would come back to earth with it’s pricing to $499, and apple is gonna use it a selling point. “apple’s most affordable iphone, now even cheaper” or something cheesy like that.",neutral,0.5026764273643494,0,True

2025-03-25,"First off, sorry in advance for the long response!

I concur with a lot of you experience. I bought a new 16e for under $472 total (it's locked to TMo) on p2p market. I'm coming back to iOS after 1.5 years back with Android for various reasons I won't bore you with. Then, someone on FB took up my trade offer to swap my like new S25 Plus with their like new 16 Pro. So, I've been using them both for a few days.

  
1) Camera

The camera on the 16e is definitely **just fine**. Outdoors, indoor with lots of natural light? Pics look like any other unless you're determined to zoom in and find the weaknesses. Dimmer light, the focus definitely gets noticeable challenged. It'll focus on inanimate objects better than people or maybe it's just my kids being ghouls. In extremely low light, like pitch dark with only a night lamp, it'll gather enough light so you can see the picture, but the quality is just bad. When I've tested it by increasing exposure and really trying hard to hold my hand still, the image was slightly better, but still nothing like the 16pro (which is NOTHING like the Pixel 9). Anyway, if someone is just taking pics for fun, for memories, for posting on socials, it's fine. If someone wants to make some high res content, it's clearly not the phone for them.

2) Refresh Rate

Looking at the 16e's 60hz vs the pro's 120hz, I gotta say I barely tell the difference. When I switched the S25+ from 60hz to 120hz, I definitely saw a difference. Other posts have said that apparently the scrollling is limited to 80hz, but I'm not digging in that far. Overall, I can't tell the difference, so no biggie on this common complaint for me.

3) Notch vs Dynamic Island

I have a 13PM for work and because it's bigger the notch really didn't bother me. On the 16e, with its smaller size, it sure is more noticeable. But, I don't really mind it much. I watched something on both phones and zoomed in to fill the screen, and I didn't really get much viewing area back with the island over the notch. The Dynamic Island's been relatively useless to me so far - just like Samsung's Now Brief that I had on the S25+. 

4) Other Stuff

\- Battery life is legit! With other phones, I lost a lot more battery while connected to Carplay. On screen time has been great. I use my phone mainly for music, navigation on CarPlay, messaging folks, reading stuff, watching stuff, and playing mostly low (no) GPU needs games.

\- The speakers are better than the S25+ or any other flagship android phone I've used. They've always been a little tinny or someone sounding like coming out of a drain. The 16e sounds much more full.

\- The camera button on the 16 Pro has been nice to have for a quick launch of the camera. But I don't miss it much on the 16e since I just use the Action Button for the camera. Then, I just learned how to customize the back tap options in the Accessibility menu.

Ultimately, I'm still deciding on what to keep. I know at some point I'll want to make some content and need to use my phone to do so or I'll be at an indoor show and want some decent snaps of what's happening rather than the washed out mess that I had with the iPhone 13. I do recognize the price I paid for it is probably closer to an acceptable price point for most people. I knew that I could sell it at cost if I absolutely hated it. But the 16e's been fun to use and hasn't felt like a ""downgrade"" except for the camera and for readjustment back to iOS restrictions from Android. So, for anyone that doesn't need the other bells and whistles.. it's a perfectly fun phone.",first sorry advance long response concur lot experience bought new 16e 472 total locked tmo p2p market coming back io year back android various reason wont bore someone took trade offer swap like new s25 plus like new pro ive using day camera camera 16e definitely fine outdoors indoor lot natural light pic look like unless youre determined zoom find weakness dimmer light focus definitely get noticeable challenged itll focus inanimate object better people maybe kid ghoul extremely low light like pitch dark night lamp itll gather enough light see picture quality bad ive tested increasing exposure really trying hard hold hand still image slightly better still nothing like 16pro nothing like pixel anyway someone taking pic fun memory posting social fine someone want make high re content clearly phone refresh rate looking 16es 60hz pro 120hz got say barely tell difference switched s25 60hz 120hz definitely saw difference post said apparently scrollling limited 80hz digging far overall cant tell difference biggie common complaint notch dynamic island 13pm work bigger notch really didnt bother 16e smaller size sure noticeable dont really mind much watched something phone zoomed fill screen didnt really get much viewing area back island notch dynamic island relatively useless far like samsungs brief s25 stuff battery life legit phone lost lot battery connected carplay screen time great use phone mainly music navigation carplay messaging folk reading stuff watching stuff playing mostly low gpu need game speaker better s25 flagship android phone ive used theyve always little tinny someone sounding like coming drain 16e sound much full camera button pro nice quick launch camera dont miss much 16e since use action button camera learned customize back tap option accessibility menu ultimately still deciding keep know point ill want make content need use phone ill indoor show want decent snap whats happening rather washed mess iphone recognize price paid probably closer acceptable price point people knew could sell cost absolutely hated 16es fun use hasnt felt like downgrade except camera readjustment back io restriction android anyone doesnt need bell whistle perfectly fun phone,"first off, sorry in advance for the long response!

i concur with a lot of you experience. i bought a new 16e for under $472 total (it's locked to tmo) on p2p market. i'm coming back to ios after 1.5 years back with android for various reasons i won't bore you with. then, someone on fb took up my trade offer to swap my like new s25 plus with their like new 16 pro. so, i've been using them both for a few days.

  
1) camera

the camera on the 16e is definitely just fine. outdoors, indoor with lots of natural light? pics look like any other unless you're determined to zoom in and find the weaknesses. dimmer light, the focus definitely gets noticeable challenged. it'll focus on inanimate objects better than people or maybe it's just my kids being ghouls. in extremely low light, like pitch dark with only a night lamp, it'll gather enough light so you can see the picture, but the quality is just bad. when i've tested it by increasing exposure and really trying hard to hold my hand still, the image was slightly better, but still nothing like the 16pro (which is nothing like the pixel 9). anyway, if someone is just taking pics for fun, for memories, for posting on socials, it's fine. if someone wants to make some high res content, it's clearly not the phone for them.

2) refresh rate

looking at the 16e's 60hz vs the pro's 120hz, i gotta say i barely tell the difference. when i switched the s25+ from 60hz to 120hz, i definitely saw a difference. other posts have said that apparently the scrollling is limited to 80hz, but i'm not digging in that far. overall, i can't tell the difference, so no biggie on this common complaint for me.

3) notch vs dynamic island

i have a 13pm for work and because it's bigger the notch really didn't bother me. on the 16e, with its smaller size, it sure is more noticeable. but, i don't really mind it much. i watched something on both phones and zoomed in to fill the screen, and i didn't really get much viewing area back with the island over the notch. the dynamic island's been relatively useless to me so far - just like samsung's now brief that i had on the s25+.

2025-02-24,"The thing is carriers are selling the 15 for the same amount or even with a better deal as they're trying to get rid of that older stock. For the same money you get the additional wide angle camera which can do macro shots as well, and all those missing things that you probably don't use at the moment, Magsafe, precise location, but also things you might appreciate like a newer and brighter display. The main thing missing is Apple's AI. It also has the mute switch that your 13 has if you like that more than the new button.

Maybe you still prefer the 16E overall, but isn't it odd that the 15 from 2023 is still available yet has somewhat better hardware than a 2025 iPhone in the 16 lineup?

Imagine if you came from your 13 with a magsafe bedside charging stand and you just assumed that a 16E in 2025 will obviously work with it as well, as Apple didn't even mention the lack of Magsafe support. Many customers will come from an iPhone 12 or 13 with Magsafe accessoires and they will only find out the mistake after buying it and realizing they can't put it on the charge stand.

The 16E is a very strange iPhone in that it's a 16 lineup iPhone yet doesn't support some of the core iPhone experiences that your older 13 supported just fine. Oh and the best part in the comparison between your 13 and the 16E? The displays are identical. I understand it's not really that important, but modern displays literally get twice as bright nowadays to be better readable in the sun and then Apple sells you the same display you bought with your 13 in 2021.

Coming from the 13 is an odd spot as well.

maybe you still prefer the 16e overall, but isn't it odd that the 15 from 2023 is still available yet has somewhat better hardware than a 2025 iphone in the 16 lineup?

imagine if you came from your 13 with a magsafe bedside charging stand and you just assumed that a 16e in 2025 will obviously work with it as well, as apple didn't even mention the lack of magsafe support. many customers will come from an iphone 12 or 13 with magsafe accessoires and they will only find out the mistake after buying it and realizing they can't put it on the charge stand.

the 16e is a very strange iphone in that it's a 16 lineup iphone yet doesn't support some of the core iphone experiences that your older 13 supported just fine. oh and the best part in the comparison between your 13 and the 16e? the displays are identical. i understand it's not really that important, but modern displays literally get twice as bright nowadays to be better readable in the sun and then apple sells you the same display you bought with your 13 in 2021.

I had the 16 pro for a week before I got sick of how heavy it is and scratching my head trying to figure out the upgrades from my old iPhone 14 that I gave to my little brother (otherwise I would still have it): also the battery drained surprisingly quick, more than my old 14. So far this 16e has best battery life in any phone I’ve ever had including the 16 pro. Also, what a relief on my hand. I love how light it is. The 16 pro felt like I was holding a brick.

Is an iPhone without whistle and bell, essential, that cover all the basic.

Good battery life, usb C, decent camera, action button, you can still use magsafe with a case.

It is a phone, is not meant to replace your camera or gaming console.

And again is history repeating itself, same as for the iphone 5c and XR, lots of critics when came out but after couple of months when price settles down ... best buy.",think 16e tribute past look like iphone iphone without whistle bell essential cover basic good battery life usb decent camera action button still use magsafe case phone meant replace camera gaming console history repeating iphone lot critic came couple month price settle best buy,"i think the 16e is a tribute to the past, it look like an iphone 4s.
