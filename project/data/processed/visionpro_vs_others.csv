Are you insane? At 450g, the AVP is one of the lightest VR headsets ever made.

\>Probably why it has a tiny battery life

Yeap, you're just insane. The AVP has 2\~2,5h of battery life while supporting the M2+R1 chips, which makes the headset, by a WIDE margin, the undisputed leader in processing capabilities among standalone headsets while supporting this processing power by at least two hours with its battery.

\>Oh, and it doesn't work with any existing ecosystems or software.

yeap, you're just insane. the avp has 2\~2,5h of battery life while supporting the m2+r1 chips, which makes the headset, by a wide margin, the undisputed leader in processing capabilities among standalone headsets while supporting this processing power by at least two hours with its battery.

2024-01-14,"Apple putting a lot more work in comfort is an assumption. The usual process is annual or bi-annual iteration with a glimpse of innovation to justify next buy (tech as a trend/fashion). Now Apple has to compromise this iteration process and have a really good first year device, because they are behind and need to play catch up.

But this tiny advance cycle is not just Apple, many other corporations do this (Samsung, etc.) but Apple is particularly talented at that.

And, just like with the camera wars, pixel count is tiny bit of the relevant parameters. Pixels\*FOV do give you a better sense of image quality (too much FOV for a given res and it'll look blurry even for super high resolutions, low FOV and image will look crisp even with low res). And then there's also the lens quality / compromises (soft spot vs accuracy vs weight vs size vs...). And then also pixel composition. etc.

Point being, oversimplifying to screen resolution is handy for marketing purposes (specially if you are in the top end) but should not be the definite parameter to consider, not by a long shot. Actually just thinking on the spot that a 'Fixels' (FOV to pixel ratio or something like that) parameter would be better suited. Fixels per second and you get display refresh rate too... xD I'm making this overcomplicated and that's no good for marketing strategies.

That said, I have no doubt the Vision is going to be a high quality device. But I think the quality/price ratio will be noticeably lower than other alternatives. Because that's how Apple operates, high quality status devices with small improving iterations.

Being their first year product, it is unlikely they will mess up with things like an antenna-gate or charging port at the bottom of the mouse. But it could happen. VR is particularly tricky.

It doesn't make economic sense for this brand to do amazing innovation. They already have massive user base (and established tech image), so they just have to keep the interest, with minimal effort/cost. Their focus is on fashion and status (polish and quality being a requirement to keep up on such leads).

As for your last point. Given how tiny the initial production runs are for the Vision, it's unlikely they'll move the development needle: most devs don't play risky games with small user bases so most developments will be cross-platform (and actually getting ROI mostly from the larger existing user bases) unless paid by the brand.",apple putting lot work comfort assumption usual process annual biannual iteration glimpse innovation justify next buy tech trendfashion apple compromise iteration process really good first year device behind need play catch tiny advance cycle apple many corporation samsung etc apple particularly talented like camera war pixel count tiny bit relevant parameter pixelsfov give better sense image quality much fov given re itll look blurry even super high resolution low fov image look crisp even low re there also lens quality compromise soft spot accuracy weight size also pixel composition etc point oversimplifying screen resolution handy marketing purpose specially top end definite parameter consider long shot actually thinking spot fixels fov pixel ratio something like parameter would better suited fixels per second get display refresh rate making overcomplicated thats good marketing strategy said doubt vision going high quality device think qualityprice ratio noticeably lower alternative thats apple operates high quality status device small improving iteration first year product unlikely mess thing like antennagate charging port bottom mouse could happen particularly tricky doesnt make economic sense brand amazing innovation already massive user base established tech image keep interest minimal effortcost focus fashion status polish quality requirement keep lead last point given tiny initial production run vision unlikely theyll move development needle devs dont play risky game small user base development crossplatform actually getting roi mostly larger existing user base unless paid brand,"apple putting a lot more work in comfort is an assumption. the usual process is annual or bi-annual iteration with a glimpse of innovation to justify next buy (tech as a trend/fashion). now apple has to compromise this iteration process and have a really good first year device, because they are behind and need to play catch up.

have you never seen a grpah before or something?
data does not need to say something by stayting it in texy to be missleading...
we are human beings we understand complex ideas we put things together to make meaning. a green light also dosn't say go but we know it means you have to go! when you make a data visualizatiom where most known headsest take up 1/2th of a box and the vp the other half by itself while comparing resolution it is pretty obvious too all that are not dumb or brainwashed or egotistical that that is trying to imply that the vp is the best. that is missleading when you don't compare other products in that price range. 

wait i foud something that might help you if you really are super young which there is nothing wrong with:

Apple participating in the VR space is likely to make a (positive) mark in the industry. Given their scale, them involved on anything can cause market shift. We'll see, definitely interesting future with such giant joining the party.

Also, thinking about it, one of the biggest challenges in VR is ergonomics for the masses. Making a product that fits perfectly to most people in the world, with their big and small noses, spread eyes, weak VR legs, ... etc. In that sense, Apple has an edge because they invest a lot on comfort/ergonomics/ease of use (yeah, my comment on that being an assumption was off).

In that regard, they will eventually have to do like Big Screen and develop a customization service for perfect ergonomics (eg. custom print face holder). This level of customization will become industry standard for many sectors in the upcoming years... I think... I hope.

Definitely, making something as simple and as fool proof as possible requires an amazing amount of work that stays hidden behind an intuitive and easy to use interface. The problem for some (a minority?) users is that this often means limiting flexibility and personalization, specially when it comes to Apple... but that's one of my personal quarrels :P

Can't completely agree regarding innovation. But yes, you make a very good point regarding 'hidden' innovations through investing in new manufacturing processes, materials and the likes.

But to me it makes a lot of sense for big corporate to avoid risks with strong innovation. That's the space or gamble for dynamic small enterprises, start-ups and the like. Those drive the revolution, take the risk... might win or fail big time, but definitely will guide the big guys (who then buy the verified result, or just pirate it)

Apple has had several occasions where it delayed integrating standards that had been around (on Android, for example) for years (most recently adding RCS, using usb-c, ...). And I see this as innovation holding (on topics which at certain point are not innovation anymore), just keeping things on the list to have a slightly new product for the next year.

Here there can be other factors like stubbornness of considering their approach always best or to protect their ecosystems, or just being cheeky/spoiled... or r/IAmTheMainCharacter (this is what comes to mind when I think of Jobs and his cars without license plates).

As for the quality/price ratio. My point is that they do very high quality products (most of the time) but the mark up price is disproportionate to the development costs. Because price actually is part of their marketing, their status symbol. With the added benefit of raking up a lot of extra cash. This is the feel I get when I compare products on similar quality level but disparaging price. And I say 'feel' because it is a complex analysis to objectively review dev cost vs product price.

In fact if we take a look at a few recent statistics it looks like there are roughly 2.5 billion Android devices in the world as of early 2024. iPhone is at around 2.3 billion. One other number I saw from 2022 is that there were an estimated 1.4 billion windows users at the time. These are all crazy high numbers of course, and many of those users will never game on their device. Just in the room I'm sitting in right now, there are 13 phones and tablets of various operating systems and models, but only one has been used for gaming in the past 2 years (my current one), the rest were used at one point in the past (and donated), or else were bought solely for other purposes.

2024-01-28,"Thanks for the response! I do appreciate the time spent! Your VR pedigree is impressive, to say the least. You hit it on the nose; Quest 3 is the best value in VR that I am aware of. Myself; I'm on multiple PC upgrades, I've hosted VR settings where tech minutia has come into play, like the Vive 2.0 base stations over-riding the 1.0's; to do multiple zones in a large area had us moving the 2.0's around, stapling cardboard shields to cedar posts to keep the 2.0's from screwing up our 1.0 tracking. Most I've managed was three 2.0 base stations in very specific tested locations for Index or Vive Pro 2, two areas with 1.0's on carefully positioned tripods for a couple of vives, and a couple of Quests with their own area-mapping. I don't have to sport EVERYTHING; I actually found a few locals who are also enthusiasts.

2024-01-14,">Subpixel count is totally irrelevant. Are there any other arrangement than RGB? Meaning 3 sub pixels per one pixel?

Yes there are, it has been one of the biggest display related debates in VR. Most OLED HMDs we have are using pentile panels, which only have two subpixels per pixel. That's a massive drop in real-life information despite having the same resolution.

Not only do you render less detail, you still waste the same performance. Also the diagonal placement makes for example reading more difficult. It's still to be seen what approach AVP takes.

No it ain't. It isn't measured by eye, there are cameras and testers for that purpose.

things however have gotten a bit more complex now as meta has started to tilt their lcd-panels diagonally (to increase vfov), which means that at times even lcd-hmds can suffer of that aliasing.

that's essentially the gist between the two arrangements.",neutral,0.8682912588119507,0
2024-01-14,"Yeah, we're talking about different things. You're talking about whether the elements of color are R, G, and B (which they are, except in WRGB displays), I'm talking about the layout of those elements and whether they correspond 1:1 with logical pixels, which they do not necessarily. As an example, from the article I linked:

> The particularity on the smaller P20 is the RGBW subpixel layout. In theory this allows better light transmissivity as the white subpixels lets through more of the backlight light. The problem here is that it’s **not a 4 subpixel per logical pixel layout but rather a custom layout with mixed subpixel configurations**. Together with the lower 1080p resolution this results in a noticeably lower effective resolution and sharpness than you would expect from a traditional 1080p screen, and the end result is a lot closer to the sharpness of an OLED’s diamond pentile layout.
