2024-05-02,"AirPod Pro 2 vs Bose QC Ultra Earbuds: A Personal Comparison

After my AirPod Pro broke, I decided to explore new options. While I had enjoyed using the AirPod Pro, I struggled with the fit of the buds. This time around, I decided to try out the Bose QC Ultra earbuds, alongside the newly released AirPod Pro 2. Here’s my experience comparing both products.

Bose QC Ultra Earbuds

Fit and Comfort

The Bose QC Ultra earbuds fit comfortably, much more so than my previous AirPod Pro. They sit securely in my ears, making them ideal for extended wear, whether working out or lounging.

Audio Features

I was impressed by the ability to adjust the equalizer, allowing me to fine-tune the audio to my liking. The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is also a highlight, effectively drowning out background noise better than the AirPod Pro 2.

Immersive Audio and Connectivity

Bose offers an immersive audio experience, although I noticed occasional glitches. This inconsistency with connectivity is concerning but not a deal-breaker yet.

AirPod Pro 2

Spatial Audio

Apple’s Spatial Audio stands out, especially when watching Dolby Atmos movies on Apple TV. The soundstage is well-defined, creating an engaging listening experience.

Comparisons

While the ANC is slightly less effective than Bose’s offering, the AirPod Pro 2’s Spatial Audio and seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem give it an edge.

Conclusion

While the AirPod Pro 2 offers seamless integration and great Spatial Audio, I’m leaning toward keeping the Bose QC Ultra earbuds for their superior comfort, ANC, and adjustable EQ. However, the connectivity glitches are a concern.

2023-11-07,"Neither are really made for sports. Some people have issues keeping AirPods Pro 2 in while running and the sweat resistance is low on both the APP2 and Ultra earbuds. The Ultra do offer multiple fin tips so you can get a more secure fit with them.

Sound quality is completely subjective. Want a more neutral sound? Go with the APP2. Want a pair of earbuds that you can EQ and make sound closer to how you want? Get the Ultra. You can technically EQ the APP2, but it’s a pain and still not the same as having a 3-band EQ in an app (there is no companion app for the APP2).

The Ultra have measurably better ANC than the APP2, but both are good. You’ll have a less buggy experience with the APP2 if you have an iPhone. They will have a rock solid connection compared to the Bose and far fewer random bugs. They’re also much smaller than the Bose, as is their charging case. They’re also $100 less than the Bose.

Really, the proper comparison is between the APP2 and QC earbuds II because the Ultra don’t really improve anything except for connectivity with Snapdragon Sound certified devices (iPhones, Galaxy phones, and Pixels aren’t certified) and immersive audio that is only a gimmick which reduces audio quality.

The one thing I will add, is that Bose buds completely seal off the ear while both APP 1 and 2 have a vent system that alleviates some (not all) of the pressure.

2025-02-09,"I’m 47. We only lose the ability to hear high frequency sounds starting about 50. You can check your current ability via YouTube and someone has gathered them [here](https://decibelhearing.com/hearing-loss-overview/high-frequency-hearing-loss/). I don’t think there’s a lot happening up at those frequencies in most music. I could hear the 12K but I couldn’t hear the 15K.

The frequencies up to 15K that are missing in AAC, often form details of certain instruments and vocals.

There’s a myth perpetuation about only a small number of people being able to tell the difference. This is usually based on very small samples, like 500 people, or the results of random YouTubers’ tests, or the words of Apple’s marketing writers. Much of which was said over a decade ago, not considering advancements in drivers today. Neither would form the basis for a scientific fact. 

It would largely depend on the ability of the headphone/earphone to resolve the detail but also your familiarity with the music. It’s not something you just take random samples and give it a go. It’s songs you’ve known for years. I remember actually picking up on it with the QCUE’s for the first time. It’s a bit like a subtle muffling you get with AAC. Often described as a veil. You don’t know that you’re missing something until you have heard the lossless version on the same equipment. I realised something was wrong and that’s when I discovered Apple Music had glitched and was sending me the AAC version of a song I’d known for most of my life. It is subtle though. The likes of my casual music fan mother, wouldn’t care even if she did detect it.

So, for some people, it’s not a big deal. This is where the difference comes in. For someone that loves a particular artist, they’re going to want to dig for that extra detail they never knew was there. It can be rewarding and some even find it moving. It is not placebo and anyone saying that is simply inexperienced pretending they’re not. I’d actually say the placebo is the other way around. When you haven’t heard it, you don’t know that it exists. I was oblivious myself with the original and QCEII’s. To be fair though, the QCUE’s are not the ideal tool for picking out the distinction. It would be better to have a multi-driver IEM or over-ear recognised for being highly resolving. It wasn’t until I got my first IEM’s that this whole other world opened up to me. A lot of it is “ear/brain training” but when you know, you know.

2024-11-25,"I have the Bose QC Ultra Earbuds and the Apple Airpods Pro 2 (for my wife).

Fit: Both are comfortable. But I'd say Ultra is better because after using it for a while, I sometimes forgot I was wearing the earbuds. Apple is deeper into the ear canal so you'll always feel it, however they are light -- no big deal.

ANC: Ultra blows Apple out of water. No contest there. When my range hood is on high, Ultra blocks everything but there's still quite a bit from Apple. 

Sound quality: I'd say the Apple sounds more balanced out of box. Bose is heavier on the bass, which I don't prefer. However, I use the wavelet app on Android to EQ it back to a balanced profile. When doing so there isn't too much difference. 

Connectivity: I noticed the Bose would occasionally turn off in one of the ear as well. It's annoying but doesn't happen very often. There is sometimes the statics and electronics noise from the left bud, personally I'm okay with it. 

Personally I'd pick Bose Ultra. But hey you can buy both of them :)

As for Bose QC -- they are not comfortable for me so I tried and returned them.
