2024-03-30,"I just got my set yesterday and I literally can’t take them off! I absolutely love them! The technology in these things are beyond amazing! I love the noise cancellation the best , it is really top shelf. I had a pair of soundsport buds and they didn’t have the noise cancellation. The battery started getting worse and worse until it would only hold 15 minutes of juice. So I figured what the hell id give it a shot and call Bose to see if they could do anything for me (they were 4 yrs old out of warranty) and to my surprise they offered me these ones for $150 + tax. I paid $164 total and free shipping just had to send my old ones back to them in which they provided the label. These are $300 everywhere I’ve looked so I’d say I got a deal. Their customer support is great. I just figured out how to use the equalizer on their app which is really cool. I believe these could be dangerous if you have the noise cancellation on and you’re walking near traffic, you definitely will not hear them. All in all if you are on the fence about getting a set I’d say go for it cuz they are amazing! All the features (I’m still learning) are so cool.

2024-03-30,"I had to comment as I used the first qc and regretted buying them for their size…Especially when the qc ii came out.
‘Frustrating’ is a rather extreme adjective to use with these earbuds perhaps, especially if you have not tried the oversized mark i..!
No one does ANC like Bose.They invented the concept. 

Where they fail is in the quality of music sound that pours out of their buds at times…But frustrating it is not, as the EQ or better still, your own personal EQ will resolve that issue. Easy to download a third party version to your phone of some MP3 devices…

I never had audio cut outs nor similar with my earbuds… Perhaps it is the one you’ve got. 

As for ANC and sound quality, you need to have the right wing tips for your ears so they fit tightly.
I watched many reviews and never came across those issues.

I would say that the battery life is its worse feature when compared with other brands which give much more and for the price they cost.

You mention the size of the case! 
Have you seen the first version’s case??? Much bigger that you will enjoy the mark ii version for sure if you know how awful it was.

As for the Sony Mark 5, it will have to improve its ANC to beat Bose’s ANC and aggressive marketing campaign  as they have something which puts them  where they are in this ever changing headset and  gadget market.

If Bose are where they are it is because they do not put all their  eggs in one basket…

So perhaps a smaller case will come, longer battery life for sure  and perhaps even smaller earbuds with optimum sound which does not need tweaking.

2024-03-30,"I own the Bose QC Ultra earbuds and I strongly recommend that you update BOTH the buds and the charging case. That will fix many of your connection problems. 

The lack of multipoint connection is very irritating.  In my case,  it is the most irritating flaw on the earbuds. 

The controls on these earbuds are better than any other earbuds I have used by far.  It's not even close. 

The fit and comfort of these earbuds are the best I have ever worn by far.  It's not even close. 

The sound quality is spectacular.  I'm not sure if there's a big difference between the QC II and QC II Ultra earbuds,  but the Ultra sound is stunning. 

The Sony XM5  earbuds require four taps to change volume,  which is the most used control on any set of earbuds.  That is just absurdly stupid!  I don't see how you don't understand that. That defect alone would stop me from buying the Sony earbuds. 

Most of the time, my single point connection with the QC II Ultras works flawlessly. But lack of multipoint connection irritates the hell out of me.

The ANC is simply the best, especially for irritating low range noises which are as common as dirt. They also do superb job of blocking out cafe and workplace voice noise,  even loud noises. 

I play basketball with them on and rarely have to adjust them.  They are great workout earbuds.

Audio drop outs are random, and annoying. Sometimes won't get any, sometimes its so frequent as to become frustrating.  The having to select the buds manually each time someone calls you thing is such an annoyance!

However, main issue i've found is they seem to just fail over time. I'm about to send my SECOND pair back under warranty today (and this is how i found this vid, googling for issues on these ear buds).

My first pair, a few months in, just started playing up randomly. Only one ear bud would connect. Another time, they'd refuse to connect at all, and only way to solve to remove pairing and repair. And often the re-pairing would fail. These random faults became an almost daily occuracne and got so fed up, i sent back under warranty, and to be fair did get sent a new pair.

I've had replacement pair 3 or so months now, and the last 3 days, these random failings are starting again. Exactly the same issues as the first pair. Mega frustrating, and going back under warranty again.

2023-03-31,"The Bose QC 2 hit on all the main points for me. They're hands down the best ANC for wireless buds to date (Might be better than my Sony XM5 at ANC and those are over ear! No ). The ANC reduces noise so well you don't have to listen to music higher than 50% volume, saving your ears from any future hearing damage. These are fantastic buds for working out. Bose QC2  stay in your ear even with a sweaty workout. Bose did a wonderful job balancing the sound and there's an adjustable EQ for high, mids and lows or 4 presets you can choose from as well. The bass is thumpy asf and it's not too much where it drowns the mids. Touch control is very reliable. Bose created a nice curvature at the top of the headphone that makes for more accuracy for touch controls because it can better sense the tip of your finger. Transparency mode is almost as good as the new Airpods Pro 2. You can create your own transparency mode which is pretty cool.

Interesting to read the various comments posted - I've had a whole series of Bose head- and ear-phones over the years, in a job that involved a lot of planes, trains and automobiles (and occasionally Offshore oil & gas installations, steel foundries and the odd coal mine), so I was surprised to find a product review that was headed ""Huge Disappointment"".

2) fit to ear is excellent
3) active noise cancelling quite good: 8.5 / 10
cons:
1) bluetooth connection is very buggy. connected to phone, then connected to pc and then earphones gets completely confused, refuse to connect to any device. i had to unpair/pair them several times, and phone connection is working again. 
2) mic is not well protected from sweat. i was on cardio track and after 20 minutes, when i get really sweat, left earbud started to emit loud noise similar to scratching directly into my ear and voice assistant reported problem with active noise cancellation.",neutral,0.46449634432792664,0

2023-03-31,"Great review good sir! I also would like to add that I did not like that the case was just a magnetic holder, there have been a few times where I have fumbled the other case and it stayed closed. But my raycons anytime I dropped them it would send the buds flying. And I can see that this case facilitates flying. Because the lid is going to take the impact force and jar open, and then the earbuds securely in place, will transfer the energy and shoot out lol!  I just feel that the case could have been another flatter design like it is but perhaps open up a bit differently because you need to pinch them out of the case in a certain way. Going straight at them as if I was going for the previous QC version one buds, and I kept slipping off of it. Figured out that I need to have my fingertip on that Ridge. And what that means is that I now have to finangle the earbud in my fingertips before putting it into my ear and twisting. So it has led to me dropping them a few times, but just on grass and carpet. And I am disappointed because you would have figured that all the little tiniest of things they would have thought about in their $300 earbuds. And I am seeing all the little things as being steps backward. You pluck an earbud out of the QC1 case, and you never have to reposition them in your fingers whatsoever, and thus you stop holding your pinch from initially plucking them out of the case, once they are securely in your ears. Not where I pluck these out, and while I'm holding my case with my left hand, my right fingers pinch it up, and now I have to roll them so that I am now pinching the sides. But now it is right on my fingertip, but it's down on my thumb so now I have to put my pinky and ring finger kind of under it to support it as I Let Go briefly and allow gravity to keep them in all of my fingers in an awkward position well I get to a perfect pinch. And you can see how this sucks compared to pinching the sides of the old buds and then not letting go until they are in your ear!

2023-03-31,"I've seen alot of mixed reviews online for Bose earbuds, whats surprising when their headphones are very much posative. The Bose earbuds have been a posative use for myself. The sound is really great, even more so with EQ adjusting in the bose music app. I will be honest, the wireless charging loss with the secound gen is disappointing to hear with it now being something I'm now a custom too. You can still use single use, it just works only leaving in the the right earbud and returning the left in the case, but yes both being able too would be good, but i don't mind it, works and you get used too. Multi use with devices I'm hoping they'll bring in a update, as its frustrating this isn't a more common ability on wireless earbuds still. Battery has been really great to be honest on the original Bose buds and i don't expect crazy battery life like 10hrs before need to put away to charge. due to the ANC which i can imagine drains alot, more so possibly then other brands. Comfort is great compared to others and zero movment no matter what you're doing, but the concept of the new earbuds looks to be a nice improvment, as the wing edge on the first gens were the first thing to cause discomfort, bare in mind that only occurs many hours later for myself. The main focus being the ANC is just a pleasure, and for me being sensitive with sounds and due to that a huge ANC junkie these are crazy good, can't wait to experience the second generation, but I hope they bring more bluetooth features in an software update as they have bluetooth 5.3 and the hardware appears all there.",ive seen alot mixed review online bose earbuds whats surprising headphone much posative bose earbuds posative use sound really great even adjusting bose music app honest wireless charging loss secound gen disappointing hear something custom still use single use work leaving right earbud returning left case yes able would good dont mind work get used multi use device hoping theyll bring update frustrating isnt common ability wireless earbuds still battery really great honest original bose bud dont expect crazy battery life like 10hrs need put away charge due anc imagine drain alot possibly brand comfort great compared others zero movment matter youre concept new earbuds look nice improvment wing edge first gen first thing cause discomfort bare mind occurs many hour later main focus anc pleasure sensitive sound due huge anc junkie crazy good cant wait experience second generation hope bring bluetooth feature software update bluetooth hardware appears,"i've seen alot of mixed reviews online for bose earbuds, whats surprising when their headphones are very much posative. the bose earbuds have been a posative use for myself. the sound is really great, even more so with eq adjusting in the bose music app. i will be honest, the wireless charging loss with the secound gen is disappointing to hear with it now being something i'm now a custom too. you can still use single use, it just works only leaving in the the right earbud and returning the left in the case, but yes both being able too would be good, but i don't mind it, works and you get used too. multi use with devices i'm hoping they'll bring in a update, as its frustrating this isn't a more common ability on wireless earbuds still. battery has been really great to be honest on the original bose buds and i don't expect crazy battery life like 10hrs before need to put away to charge. due to the anc which i can imagine drains alot, more so possibly then other brands. comfort is great compared to others and zero movment no matter what you're doing, but the concept of the new earbuds looks to be a nice improvment, as the wing edge on the first gens were the first thing to cause discomfort, bare in mind that only occurs many hours later for myself. the main focus being the anc is just a pleasure, and for me being sensitive with sounds and due to that a huge anc junkie these are crazy good, can't wait to experience the second generation, but i hope they bring more bluetooth features in an software update as they have bluetooth 5.3 and the hardware appears all there.",positive,0.8811038136482239,1

Fit me right out of the box. I may fuss with the bands later on but the seal is good with the medium bands and medium plugs.

2023-03-31,"Think I may have to eat humble pie - I've done some travelling and some walking with my QCEIIs in the last few days and have some reservations; in the past I'd have shared this on the Bose customer forum, but they took that down last year.  They do still display reviews on the website, but I couldn't find any way of posting a review there.  So here're my observations; I've been using the original QCEs for about 2 years, so this is largely a comparison with those:

THE GOOD...ANC is still the best I've come across - significantly better than the original QCEs (and actually better than my over-ear QC15s).  Audio is great; better soundstage; haven't played around with the equaliser yet.  Fit with the stabiliser bands and separate ear tips is much better than the old wing-tips, and they were pretty good.  Worth playing around with these - I used to use medium wing-tips; the QCEIIs come fitted with size 1 stabiliser band and medium ear tips.  I eventually settled on the size 3 band and the small ear tips (both sides); they stayed put walking and running.  One big difference was that I got none of the ""tramp...tramp...tramp..."" noise when walking on a hard surface that used to occur with the original QCEs - I guess that's due to a combination of the stability band fit and the reduced size/weight.  Another plus is that with the original QCEs if I was talking to someone next to me (OK or if I found myself singing along to a track my voice sounded (to me) like I had a frog in my throat - with the QCEIIs my voice sounds natural.

THE BAD...Hate the charging case.  It might be smaller and lighter and have an extra full charge in it, but taking out the earbuds on the move is very awkward.  You have to grip the top of the earbud, which is a shiny plastic, with your fingertips, and it's easy for it to slip from your fingers - don't want to have to crawl around under a plane or train seat trying to retrieve it.  You could pull on the top part of the stability band, but Bose warn against doing that when removing the band because it's easily damaged.  I see the Bose website has a video clip showing how easy it is to pop the earbuds into the case and snap the lid shut, but no video showing the case being opened and the earbuds being taken out.  Second issue with the case is that activities such as pairing requires the earbuds to be in the case with the lid open.  But if you put the case down flat (the only way you can put it down) the lid snaps shut, so you either need to prop it up or hold it.

THE UGLY...a couple of days ago I started getting short breaks in audio due to bluetooth disconnections - and sometimes when the connection came back it was to a different bluetooth device.  I went through all the usual fixes - deleting connections, re-pairing and eventually a full reset.  I tried my original QCEs in exactly the same way, and had no problems.  Then I found that when I connected to my iPhone or my iMac the connection was made but dropped after about 15 seconds.  I was able to get the BT connection to remain stable on my Sony NW-ZX507 DAP, so I went out for a long walk and tried that; it was a cold-is day (not anywhere near freezing).  No BT problems but I found the touch controls to be very unresponsive - they were fine at home.  I then did the same with my original QCEs - same walk, same temperature - and the touch controls worked perfectly.

So this morning my QCEIIs are on their way back to Bose for a ""service replacement"".  I'm hoping that I was just unlucky and got a glitched set of earbuds, or it's a known problem that'll be sorted with a firmware update (the Bose site has several reviews complaining about bluetooth).",think may eat humble pie ive done travelling walking qceiis last day reservation past shared bose customer forum took last year still display review website couldnt find way posting review herere observation ive using original qces year largely comparison goodanc still best ive come across significantly better original qces actually better overear qc15s audio great better soundstage havent played around equaliser yet fit stabiliser band separate ear tip much better old wingtips pretty good worth playing around used use medium wingtips qceiis come fitted size stabiliser band medium ear tip eventually settled size band small ear tip side stayed put walking running one big difference got none tramptramptramp noise walking hard surface used occur original qces guess thats due combination stability band fit reduced sizeweight another plus original qces talking someone next found singing along track voice sounded like frog throat qceiis voice sound natural badhate charging case might smaller lighter extra full charge taking earbuds move awkward grip top earbud shiny plastic fingertip easy slip finger dont want crawl around plane train seat trying retrieve could pull top part stability band bose warn removing band easily damaged see bose website video clip showing easy pop earbuds case snap lid shut video showing case opened earbuds taken second issue case activity pairing requires earbuds case lid open put case flat way put lid snap shut either need prop hold uglya couple day ago started getting short break audio due bluetooth disconnection sometimes connection came back different bluetooth device went usual fix deleting connection repairing eventually full reset tried original qces exactly way problem found connected iphone imac connection made dropped second able get connection remain stable sony nwzx507 dap went long walk tried coldis day anywhere near freezing problem found touch control unresponsive fine home original qces walk temperature touch control worked perfectly morning qceiis way back bose service replacement hoping unlucky got glitched set earbuds known problem thatll sorted firmware update bose site several review complaining bluetooth,"think i may have to eat humble pie - i've done some travelling and some walking with my qceiis in the last few days and have some reservations; in the past i'd have shared this on the bose customer forum, but they took that down last year.  they do still display reviews on the website, but i couldn't find any way of posting a review there.  so here're my observations; i've been using the original qces for about 2 years, so this is largely a comparison with those:

I do not like the hold function you have to hold it there for nearly 3 seconds, where before you can do two quick Taps and get your hands doing whatever else you were doing so it's kind of a big deal for someone who might need to go back and forth between modes a couple times a minute depending on what I'm doing. I have a feeling that this is an easy programming fix that they can put in their selections and personalizations inside of the phone app. And yet I am sure I will never see it because it just seems to me like they're always has to be some give and take. And I've never had something come close to perfect. Another thing that can be done which I am sure we will see, is fixing the ANC because it is garbage! Like you said, some very soft noises like a door shutting as I pull it behind me while someone is talking to me, and all the sudden everything goes silent for a second and then comes back. It's way too sensitive and there's no option to turn down the noise protection feature. Driving down the road and I am in a navigator by the way, so it's a very nice suspension and good soundproofing, and every time I hit a little bump down this dirt road, it's as quiet as ever inside the vehicle, you more so feel it. It must be creating a low frequency thump that the earbuds are picking up and responding to, and it gives you this weird effect when you're going down something like a washboard road. So I'm hitting all these little bumps and it's responding to it, and then it's not responding to it and then responding to it again, it gives us weird buffeting effect, like when you have a rear window down going down the road and sometimes the air pressure builds up in the car and then it pushes back out and then it's able to absorb more pressure than push it back out.. the buffeting effect. I get the same thing out of these earbuds out of noises it really shouldn't be responding tool on the ear protection side, not the noise canceling aspect of it, but the ear protection or noise protection part of it. For me, I'm going to need to see some updates to fix all these issues or I will send them back right before the end of the 90-day term because I bought the previous version of the QuietComfort earbuds only 2 months ago out of walmart. Got the 3-year protection and everything. And because of the fact that I am pretty much seen with having these suckers on all day long, for whatever I'm doing, even when I'm out in the UTV riding trails, I'm usually using these earbuds. And that brings me to another final thing. I wish there was a mode, where it neither had awareness mode turned on, nor active noise cancellation. Then I could use it like I do my raycons as earbuds in order to block noise and I can shoot. Also, it doesn't work very good for four wheeling at all. I don't want to be anywhere on the scale of noise cancellation to one side an awareness on the other side. Picking a midpoint is not what I'm looking for. I'm looking for having those things to Simply turned off so that the buds are blocking noise, because like I said, then I could be able to shoot. Otherwise I have to use my raycons and I would love for there to be a reason where I didn't need Recons for anything. But their Simplicity in their design allows me to plan pause music, go four wheeling, and simply have everything muffled by the mere fact that I have something jammed in my ear.

2023-12-04,"Hello!

I ended up getting the Audio Technica TWX9. 

Excellent build quality, that case, and buds just ooze quality. The beoplay ex has a better earbuds (that glass Anthracite Oxygen colour is class), but the twx9 has a better case.

Sound quality is up there. It can be natural, it can be bassy but not overly so and controlled. It has nice instrument separation. 

I believe the sennies and bose will have more ""oomph"" in the bass, but the twx9 are better controlled.

Fit is great, it comes with a gazillion earbuds, so I'd be amazed if none fit you.

Anc is decent. I think you've got to take reviewers (youtube and here, including mine) with a big pinch of salt. No earbuds can be total silence. Once you play a song (even gentle ones), most background noise is gone. I went for a flight yesterday, and it was fine. I had the whxm3(the best), whxm5(good, but not the best), wfxm4(only slightly less than the whxm5, but this is due to the foam tips). The twx9 compared to these are probably around a little bit better than the wfxm4. I personally am not exaggerating the anc, it's not bad. 

Only reason I got these, instead of sennies/bose were the reason I spoke of, and I got the twx9 for quite cheap (260). 

If the bose was cheaper, I'd get the bose. From my pov, bose has the best anc, full stop. You can't get anything better. Sound quality, is subjective. I think the bose have a generally pleasant and exciting sound profile that a lot of people will enjoy. Plus you can still tweak this a bit via the simple eq.

What this means is, the sound can still be personalised, but you know it has the best anc. Full stop. 

Where as the other options, yeah they may have good sound, but the bose also has good sound AND the best anc...

Plus the bose fits well for a lot of people. I would NOT pay anywhere close rrp though. They cheapened out on the codecs, wireless charging, case is plasticky af (for something that's aud400+). 

If you need battery life though, I believe the Sony are your only option at this range. My xm4 lasted 8 hours real life. The twx9 are more around 5 hrs. I'd say the xm5 would be similar in real life too. 

Good luck and you can ask me qs.",hello ended getting audio technica twx9 excellent build quality case bud ooze quality beoplay better earbuds glass anthracite oxygen colour class twx9 better case sound quality natural bassy overly controlled nice instrument separation believe sennies bose oomph bass twx9 better controlled fit great come gazillion earbuds amazed none fit anc decent think youve got take reviewer youtube including mine big pinch salt earbuds total silence play song even gentle one background noise gone went flight yesterday fine whxm3the best whxm5good best wfxm4only slightly le whxm5 due foam tip twx9 compared probably around little bit better wfxm4 personally exaggerating anc bad reason got instead senniesbose reason spoke got twx9 quite cheap 260 bose cheaper get bose pov bose best anc full stop cant get anything better sound quality subjective think bose generally pleasant exciting sound profile lot people enjoy plus still tweak bit via simple mean sound still personalised know best anc full stop option yeah may good sound bose also good sound best anc plus bose fit well lot people would pay anywhere close rrp though cheapened codecs wireless charging case plasticky something thats aud400 need battery life though believe sony option range xm4 lasted hour real life twx9 around hr say xm5 would similar real life good luck ask,"hello!

2023-12-13,"I appreciated your reply and reread it several times to absorb what you're saying about all these pricey, high-end sound buds. Your comment was helpful, thank you.

I ended up going with Samsung Buds Pro2. I was going to get the above ones you listed. I had gotten the Pro2 from Costco, and they were good, but trying even better sounding buds was tempting. But then Costco, where I bought my buds pro2 for $149, price matched what I can only guess was a brief glitch price of theirs but I was fortunate enough to screenshot when I saw it: $99 USD. Done. Can't argue with that deal for new buds.

Are they the best? Well they are good enough for me and the sound is nice. The pros are my phone, tablet and tv are Samsung, so to connect I do nothing but pop the buds into my ear - stupid easy!! And I appreciate the voice detection which turns on ambient/transparency mode, lowers the media volume, and I can set it to different lengths of time to go back to previous sound settings when it stops hearing voices. I use my buds for dog walks, so this setting is extremely helpful. Cons, I wish there were eq settings. I do not like a lot of bass, hurts my sinuses. I find the Dynamic eq is good enough, but not perfection. And I wish they had the 3 levels of ambient mode, like the buds2 (for $79). But at $99 for Pro2, they are good enough for my current uses - dog walks, housework, errands.  

If I was working in a cubicle or at a PC all day long, or flying often, I would get something completely different. Probably bt headphones with the best anc and excellent sound and a full equalizer. I could never justify losing a $150 bud at an airport, and headphones are fabulously passive-aggressive when you have that one coworker who doesn't stop talking.

2024-07-10,"Hey this is for everyone still having issues with one or both earbuds not charging or connecting. Delete them from your Bose app and bluetooth connections. Let both the case and the earbuds' batteries completely die. Just set the earbuds out of the case overnight and in the morning put them in to drain the case and repeat. Once you get to the point where the case will no longer charge the buds, set them aside and keep flipping the case open and closing it until neither of the lights blink. Leave it for another day or so. I know it sucks but I have a backup pair of 1st gen galaxy buds(that have worked flawlessly since 2019 btw). Once you're absolutely sure they're dead, plug the EMPTY case in to fully charge. After the white light comes on showing it's fully charged, pop your buds in and let them fully charge. Both should charge now I have no idea why but I have to do this every 4-6 months. Once the buds are fully charged, take them both out and insert one back into the case. The bud charge light should show white and assuming it does, wait for it to go away before inserting the second and waiting again for the light to turn off again. (If they are showing amber then I have no idea how to help you any further I'm sorry.) Close the case and reopen and make sure both lights are showing white, then hold the back button for 40 seconds to fully reset. Take them out of the case and pop them in your ears, then turn on bluetooth, hold the button down to put them in pairing mode, and connect to them. If they both work then you can go ahead and set them up in the app as well. This is the only method I've found to get them perfectly working again and I hope this helps.

 ""It is normal to have some crackling in excessively noisy environments. Excessively noisy environments such as airplanes taking off, concerts, emergency sirens, and construction zones (among others) can overwhelm the microphones used to monitor external frequencies (part of the ANC technology) causing the headphones to crackle or distort. Be aware, this can also happen in Quiet and Aware mode. For example, have you ever held your phone too close to your mouth or talked loudly during a phone call? When you do, your voice can sound distorted to the person you are talking to. When you move your mouth away from the phone and talk at a normal level, the sound of your voice returns to normal. This is similar to what is happening when exceptionally loud noises occur in the environment where the headphones are used. It is important to know these loud environments will not damage the headphones and there is no lasting damage to the product. If you would like to reduce the amount of times this happens we recommend doing your best to move away from the loud noises.

it all just feels like an afterthought. great anc, but terrible implementation of aptx adaptive/lossless. might as well get sony headphones if you want higher quality bluetooth since their ldac codec is baked into android and part of its standard.",neutral,0.5417888164520264,0
2024-04-30,I've had the Technics for 4 days now. They're good comporable but harder to use touch controls and not as comfortable for me so far. I'ma give em another week or so try diff tips to see if my ears could adjust. I was considering the momentums next I just don't like there fabric case lolz I'll be getting white to try if I return these technics. Bose needs to get there stuff together it's amazing when it works and I got mines new for 250.,ive technics day theyre good comporable harder use touch control comfortable far ima give another week try diff tip see ear could adjust considering momentum next dont like fabric case lolz ill getting white try return technics bose need get stuff together amazing work got mine new 250,i've had the technics for 4 days now. they're good comporable but harder to use touch controls and not as comfortable for me so far. i'ma give em another week or so try diff tips to see if my ears could adjust. i was considering the momentums next i just don't like there fabric case lolz i'll be getting white to try if i return these technics. bose needs to get there stuff together it's amazing when it works and i got mines new for 250.,negative,0.5787328481674194,-1

2024-04-23,"It will 100% work with them, you’ll just be “stuck” using AAC for Bluetooth audio. AAC on iOS devices, like iPhones, is perfectly fine. Apple’s AAC encoder is the best out there and is able to provide perceptual transparency at bitrates used for Bluetooth transmission. AAC on Android is a mess.

The reason why the Ultra won’t work with aptX on your iPhone is not because of Bose, it’s due to Apple. iPhones only transmit AAC and SBC audio, that’s it. Apple has them locked down. You could get Sony headphones and you’ll be stuck using AAC. No LDAC or anything else. Like I said, it’s fine for iPhones.

Are there any phones that use aptX adaptive lossless? It's odd that they would start using Snapdragon if it's so glitchy and such few Androids can work with it.",okay thats complicated initially understood thank explaining phone use aptx adaptive lossless odd would start using snapdragon glitchy android work,"okay that's more complicated that i initially understood it to be. thank you for explaining again.

2024-04-25,"Snapdragon chips are great for Bluetooth on any device. It’s Bose’s firmware that’s glitchy. There’s a list of Snapdragon Sound phones on Qualcomm’s website. It’s essentially any modern Android that isn’t made by Google or Samsung. Samsung uses Qualcomm’s SoCs in the US and internationally (at least they did for the S24 series) but they locked out support for Snapdragon Sound and instead support their own Samsung Scalable Codec for their earbuds.

Have a look on Qualcomm’s website. Even then, it’s not worth getting a phone just for aptX lossless. AAC is great on Apple devices and, really, nobody is going to hear the difference between AAC and aptX lossless in volume-matched blind ABX tests using whatever AAC encoder an Android phone relies on (it varies based on manufacturer).",snapdragon chip great bluetooth device bos firmware thats glitchy there list snapdragon sound phone qualcomms website essentially modern android isnt made google samsung samsung us qualcomms socs internationally least s24 series locked support snapdragon sound instead support samsung scalable codec earbuds look qualcomms website even worth getting phone aptx lossless aac great apple device really nobody going hear difference aac aptx lossless volumematched blind abx test using whatever aac encoder android phone relies varies based manufacturer,"snapdragon chips are great for bluetooth on any device. it’s bose’s firmware that’s glitchy. there’s a list of snapdragon sound phones on qualcomm’s website. it’s essentially any modern android that isn’t made by google or samsung. samsung uses qualcomm’s socs in the us and internationally (at least they did for the s24 series) but they locked out support for snapdragon sound and instead support their own samsung scalable codec for their earbuds.
