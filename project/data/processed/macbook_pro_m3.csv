2024-03-27,"Great video, especially, creating this from a hotel room!  I've seen other channels speculate that some of the biggest improvements of a 3 nm chip have to do with 2 big improvements in efficiency and one performance improvement.  As I understand it, the 3 benefits derived from that upgrade in efficiency are: 1) Lowered power consumption, i.e. less wasted natural resources and longer battery life, 2) Lowered heat generation, and 3) improved performance under heavy loads because with less heat generation also comes less performance throttling.  Although I do modest amounts of video editing and zero gaming, I definitely AM interested in using my computer for flight simulation as a serious flight training resource.  Flight Sim programs are notorious for using only one graphics core for 99% of the work.  Historically, this has run computers HARD and very HOT.  That's a problem if a person's workflow also works better with a laptop because a lot of work requires computer use while ""out in the field"".  If a computer could do the heavy lifting required by Flight Sim programs when I'm home, but could also be portable when I'm working away from home (laptop), that would be the Holy Grail of computers for me.  Maybe I'm overly optimistic, but the combination of efficiency and performance made possible by the M3 seems like it might fulfill all of that?  The efficiencies of the M1 and M2 were fine as far as power draw, but were still not quite there with heat dissipation as far as Flight Sim and 3D rendering work.  My sense is that the 3 nm technology promises a big reduction in heat generation.  Any thoughts on this?  Is this a test you would be interested in doing?

I've been a big fan of your content for a long time, and I really admire your work. I was wondering if you have any older laptops hiding in the dust that you'd be willing to give me instead of throwing away. I understand if it's not possible, but I thought it couldn't hurt to ask. Thank you for considering my request.

2024-03-27,"Exactly my own thoughts on recent announcements. I switched from MacBook Pro's to a Midnight M2 Air 16/512GB last year and I'm amazed at what it will do. General business use, browsing, a few games, some editing of 4K iPhone and 5.1K drone footage it does it all in a small light package with no moving parts.

2024-03-27,"My friend and I watched the keynote, I was interested in the chip, but not expecting much since Apple doesn't innovate. It wasn't a game changing event. 

To be perfectly transparent, anyone who bought a phone or laptop in the last 3 years does not need to upgrade. The vast majority of users are not heavy/super users. Most people scroll through Instagram, take a photo, edit a video, tableau, programming, etc all of which can be done on modern devices seemlessly. 

My buddy, who claims he is a bigger tech head than I am, could care less about the M3 performance (he began skipping through the video) which I was shocked about. I'm taking everything Apple says with a grain if salt until yotubers get a chance to do a benchmark test but the second space black came out, my buddy started literally freaking out, jumping up and down and repeated that part of the video 5 times. He basically bought the laptop immediately (in his head)

Seeing his reaction and obviously someone at the MKBHD level also have a similar, but much more reserved perspective, I suspect there will be A LOT of folks who will upgrade specifically for the black colorway. I think it's the dumbest reason someone could think of to spend $2k if they purchased a new laptop in the last 3 to 5 years. And he gets free laptops from work every few months as they look to recycle and renew their IT products. 

This is why I don't buy apple products. People who complain the most about consumerism are also the ones who carry around the apple ecosystem in their pockets, upgrading to new devices every year or every other year, and now...will toss their M1 MacBook that works perfectly fine for a black M3.

Consequently, they need to present better figures to investors.

However, even the base model of the M3 Pro chip has only 11 cores, slower RAM compared to the M2 Pro, and there's still uncertainty about the SSD.

2024-11-07,"TLDR (Sonnet 3.5): 

Here’s a concise summary of the detailed M3 MacBook Pro review:

Key Points:
- Review based on one year with 14-inch base M3 Pro MacBook Pro (11-core CPU, 14-core GPU, 18GB RAM, 512GB storage)
- Space black finish holds up well against scratches and fingerprints
- Excellent battery life with 100% health after 70 charge cycles
- MacOS Sequoia praised for versatility and features like iPhone Mirroring
- Apple Intelligence feels incomplete and rushed

Recommendations:
1. Don’t buy M3 Pro MacBook Pro now; instead:
   - Get base M4 MacBook Pro ($1599) for better value
   - Consider M1 Pro MacBook Pro (~$1000) for significant savings

2. MacBook Air vs Pro decision:
   - Air is sufficient for 90% of users
   - Pro justified for:
     - Intensive tasks (video editing, 3D modeling)
     - Premium display requirements
     - Need for additional ports
     - Wanting a more premium experience

Upgrade Advice:
- Definite upgrade recommended from Intel-based Macs
- Less compelling upgrade from M1 or later models unless specific needs exist
- Consider MacBook Air unless Pro features are specifically required

The review concludes that while the M3 MacBook Pro is an excellent device, current buyers should consider either the new M4 model or the older M1 Pro version for better value.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",tldr sonnet here concise summary detailed macbook pro review key point review based one year 14inch base pro macbook pro 11core cpu 14core gpu 18gb ram 512gb storage space black finish hold well scratch fingerprint excellent battery life 100 health charge cycle macos sequoia praised versatility feature like iphone mirroring apple intelligence feel incomplete rushed recommendation dont buy pro macbook pro instead get base macbook pro 1599 better value consider pro macbook pro 1000 significant saving macbook air pro decision air sufficient user pro justified intensive task video editing modeling premium display requirement need additional port wanting premium experience upgrade advice definite upgrade recommended intelbased mac le compelling upgrade later model unless specific need exist consider macbook air unless pro feature specifically required review concludes macbook pro excellent device current buyer consider either new model older pro version better value,"tldr (sonnet 3.5):

So far I’ve played….

FF14 (max settings before the latest expansion ran at 100FPS without problems. I don’t know about after the graphical upgrade)

Resident Evil 7 (ran surprisingly well. A couple of stutters and issues but it seemed to have been a RAM issue wishing I had shelled out for more)

Rise of the Tomb Raider (ran surprisingly well)

Bioshock Remastered (ran great)

I just got Baldur’s Gate 3 and I’m interested in testing it since it has a native MacOs port.

Now, this is where I run into problems. With how windows needs to be ran with M3, it does feel like it eats a bit of ram. So running windows and trying to run Steam it struggles a little. 

FF7 Remake wouldn’t even get through the start menu

Mass Effect Legendary Edition seemed to have problems with frames

Master Chief Collection lagged hard and had audio issues

Digimon Survive had audio issues with cutscenes

The M3 MacBook Pro has a sleek design with a satisfying keyboard and useful ports. The 14-inch model is recommended for portability, while the 16-inch is better suited for those who prioritize a larger screen. Battery life is excellent, lasting all day with heavy usage.

MacOS is the best Apple operating system, offering features like audio playback from multiple sources and seamless file management. The latest macOS 15.2 Beta 2 introduces the long-awaited ultrawide Mac virtual display, enhancing productivity. Upgrading from an Intel Mac to an Apple Silicon device is highly recommended, as it offers significant improvements in speed, battery life, and overall performance.

The M3 MacBook Pro is praised for its design and performance, but the M4 MacBook Pro or M1 Pro MacBook Pro offer better value.

2024-05-18,"the macbook pro m3 pro is very very good. I bought the macbook already. i would say and i also recite this from the apple store employee, the macbook pro m3 pro is more than enough for everyday use. it is more optimized for creative work that uses photoshop, premiere, illustrator, and DVR. 

The apple store employee said that if you are looking for just light work like MS Office, the normal macbook pro M3 is enough. even the macbook air is also enough. But if you are doing light-moderate editing and creative work using photoshop, DVR, it is better to buy the M3 pro instead since it offers you more power for seamless editing experience.

dont get me wrong, regular M3 is also sufficient for using photoshop etc, but it is recommended to buy the M3 pro instead because it is more comfortable. The employee even said to me, if you are looking for normal M3, just buy the M2 instead, the power difference is not big but cheaper. 

most of the youtube reviews that i watched said, if you are going to buy the normal M3, better to upgrade the ram to 16gb, because nowadays 8gb is not enough to accommodate our fast changing technologies. and if you were to upgrade to 16gb of ram, the price is almost like the M3 pro with 18gb of ram and better chipset. thus, if you are planning to buy a macbook with M3 chipset, at least buy the M3 pro, it is more worth it than the normal M3 chip. 

for the storage, 1tb is enough, i dont really have personal pics or media stored in my laptop. my macbook is solely for work. there is only docs, psds, pdfs, excels files inside my macbook. so, yes 1 tb is enough for me. if its not enough for you, you can buy external harddisk, it is cheaper than upgrading storage. or, icloud upgrade is always available

2024-08-06,"Hello! I haven't been in this account for so long. Sorry for the late reply. Last time I have decided to purchase the M3 Pro with 18gb ram. It works like a charm. I decided to purchase the M3 Pro because from what the others are saying from forums, youtube reviews, etc; the normal M3 that has 8gb ram is not enough to be used for apps nowadays. Currently the standard for a laptop or PC should be AT LEAST 16gb of ram. Which means u need to upgrade the normal M3 to the 16gb of ram. But at that point you might aswell buy the M3 pro because it gives you much more value with little difference of cost compared to the upgraded M3. Remember that M3 Pro not only upgrades your RAM but also upgrades your chipset. So the price difference is worth it imo. I'm not much of a tech guy but I know the chipsets options in Apple products has a quite significant difference. 

I dont know about the exact app you usually use but the apps I'm using right now is mostly chrome&amp;safari (at the same time), 3-4 docs of ms word that I havent close, 2 excels, spotify, 3 messaging apps, DVR, and photoshop with 3 canvas opened. Just to let you know, I opened my safari and chrome with a lot of tabs. The kind of tabs that only shows the logo because there is too many tabs opened. The macbook is not even lagging and still works like a wonder. It heats up but not loud, which means its still can handle more applications. And also maybe because it is still several months of use, everytime I open my photoshop app, it only loads for less than 1 second.

2024-01-03,"Well it is much better than a base model Intel from 2018!  But only because it doesn’t get as hot, and the battery lasts much longer, and it has a nicer display, but performance is about the same. 

Apple designed m3 base and pro model MacBooks to have good battery life at the expense of performance! 

If you want a moderate performance improvement at least double the ram and the internal storage. Or an earlier M1 base model, or m2 Pro (not the m2 base which is slower than the m1 base).

If you want the scary performance marketed by Apple you definitely need to either buy an M1 Max, or m2 pro or the m3 max maxed out. 

For the m3 lineup apple is reliant on many binned chips due to poor production yields. So getting the better cpu/gpu configurations boosts bus speed, drive speed, cpu and graphics core performance, and effective overall performance, if only because you get more cores running at optimum performance levels rather than downgraded chips that can’t meet the reliability standards at their native designed clock speeds. Of course being apple their solution to maintaining profitability is to max out the base model price tag than max out every step up in the lineup until the purchasers eyes and ears begin to bleed dollar signs.  Basically for performance it is a case of buy the best chipset cpu/gpu you can afford, and the base ram and storage config associated with that chipset, then flesh the beast out with fast thunderbolt attached storage from third party suppliers. This will give you at least 32GB of ram (more often these days 64GB, and 512Gb of internal storage, and the faster bus speeds.  If you are buying ram that is not a multiple of 8GB you are buying binned chips (eg. 18Gb or 36Gb is a binned 48GB chipset) and chances are the bus speed is reduced due to the fewer connections within the SoC. 

So the moral is if you want longest possible battery life and marginal performance buy the base model.  Beyond that it is a dogs breakfast of guessing what “performance” combo best suits your wallet, and need. 
If you want gaming performance your only option is to go for the best unbinned chipset you can find in the apple matrix. And buy only enough ram to run your games Posibly less than imagined if coming from a pc background. Even the 32Gb option is entirely viable because well most games run well with 8GB of CPU allocated ram, and that leaves 24Gb for GPU (see how that unified memory works) and no ram is needed to play juggle around between cpu and GPU on apple silicon so that also enhances effective ram performance a little.  The base models do not benefit very much from apple silicon because they run slower, colder, and communicate poorly with storage, and lack the ray tracing introduced to top tier m3 silicon.",well much better base model intel 2018 doesnt get hot battery last much longer nicer display performance apple designed base pro model macbooks good battery life expense performance want moderate performance improvement least double ram internal storage earlier base model pro base slower base want scary performance marketed apple definitely need either buy max pro max maxed lineup apple reliant many binned chip due poor production yield getting better configuration boost bus speed drive speed cpu graphic core performance effective overall performance get core running optimum performance level rather downgraded chip cant meet reliability standard native designed clock speed course apple solution maintaining profitability max base model price tag max every step lineup purchaser eye ear begin bleed dollar sign basically performance case buy best chipset afford base ram storage config associated chipset flesh beast fast thunderbolt attached storage third party supplier give least 32gb ram often day 64gb 512gb internal storage faster bus speed buying ram multiple 8gb buying binned chip 18gb 36gb binned 48gb chipset chance bus speed reduced due fewer connection within soc moral want longest possible battery life marginal performance buy base model beyond dog breakfast guessing performance combo best suit wallet need want gaming performance option best unbinned chipset find apple matrix buy enough ram run game posibly le imagined coming background even 32gb option entirely viable well game run well 8gb cpu allocated ram leaf 24gb gpu see unified memory work ram needed play juggle around cpu gpu apple silicon also enhances effective ram performance little base model benefit much apple silicon run slower colder communicate poorly storage lack ray tracing introduced top tier silicon,"well it is much better than a base model intel from 2018!  but only because it doesn’t get as hot, and the battery lasts much longer, and it has a nicer display, but performance is about the same.

2023-10-31,"The very unusual step of both the event and the Apple web site's product pages constantly comparing performance to the **M1** not the M2 is very telling (and in the extended info graphs where all three are shown, the labels are very deliberately designed to mislead IMHO and make it look like M3 is much faster vs M2 than it really is - I'll explain that in a separate comment if asked). Gamers ought to find a bit more interesting I guess, but the vast majority of my own workload is CPU-bound, not GPU-bound.

Have Apple ever before advertised a brand new product by comparing its performance to one from *two* generations ago?

So as we expected - a mostly uninteresting incremental update. Pricing ""drop"" on 14"" M3 is disingenuous, since that model replaces the $1499 512GB 13"" but at a higher price point and with no $1299 256GB equivalent.

I was initially relieved at the pricing staying equivalent for the rest of the range, but when I tried to configure anything to match or beat my own M1 Max 64GB, I'm forced into combinations of upgrades that cost a lot more - Apple's enforced upgrade prices are more and more of a ripoff with every passing year that they ask the same amount of money for the ever-cheaper components. M3 introduces no changes here.

Ultimately, for me, it's good news I suppose - I'm very glad I got what I got! The M1 series is still IMHO the best of Apple Silicon in many ways. M2 was faster often only by being hotter at peak and they started nickel-and-diming on the low end model SSDs with single chips when M2 came along.

This all said, the M3 would become interesting to me if I was first and foremost a Mac gamer.

In exchange for it costing $400 less.

But it was often on sale as low as $1599 anyway, the same way the AirPods Pro 2 are permanently on sale for $200 unless you buy directly from Apple.

Makes me wonder if the new model will be at an even lower sale price frequently, or if this is the price they always wanted to target and are now doing so officially by cutting the specs and their retail partners will keep it at the official price.

If the latter it seems like a worse deal given that the M1 Pro and M2 Pro 14"" were often 1599-1799 and had the better cooling and higher memory.

I personally liked how the 14"" and 16"" had complete feature parity before and it was just a matter of chosing display size.

For video editing, 16 GB RAM still uses RAM swap, which is bad because it degrades your hard drive. Somehow, Apple has been able to convince customers that RAM swap is industry standard and best practice.

RAM is so bloody cheap $12 for a stick. The only reason why Apple would go with 8GB of RAM in Silicon MacBooks and make the RAM and hard drive irreparable is so that there are *higher possibilities of customers ruining their MacBooks faster requiring complete replacement*.

AppleCare+ doesn't cover replacement if your model is obsolete, only repair.

If your MacBook can't be repaired or replaced under AppleCare+, you'll receive a partial refund of your AppleCare+ agreement.
