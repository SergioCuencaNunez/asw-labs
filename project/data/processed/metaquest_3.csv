2024-06-03,"Personally I came from a RiftS with Occulus/Meta, but I also have a Valve Index - Knuckles Controllers are still the best hands down but the Quest 3 controllers are built like tanks and lightweight, Tracking is much much Better than the RiftS was despite having better placed Camera array. Honestly LCD/Lenses I prefer the Quest 3 the pancake lenses just make that much more a difference, you aren't getting the blacks that the Index has, Its really hard to compare the 2 as the Quest 3 relies on compression versus a native render from the GPU, I wish the Quest 3 had USBtype C with DP support for the USB jack it would honestly make such a difference and a more fair comparable comparison because some games just don't Compress well, although some apps support the AV1 codec which makes a huge difference if you are using NVidia 4000 series. Still the image quality is real nice. 
From the RIftS its a major step up, Index though is a bit more complicated, If you have the extra money to toss around I would say get the Quest 3 just because it has the ability to go anywhere. However I have a major feeling Valve is cooking in the kitchen again and basically we will get a superior standalone from Valve in the next couple years that will be a no compromises headset. Personally I think the speeds of Wifi 7 will be the key to wireless HMDs having a higher bandwidth allowing for less compression artifacting and image degradation while being more stable as well. I can see Virtualization in reverse using ARM chips to run X86/x64 applications at lower settings on the go, and probably Hybrid tracking.

also, walkabout mini-golf. i originally wanted the vr for things like zombie shooters and blade and sorcery, but i was absolutely not prepared for how many hours of my life i'd lose to walkabout. this game doesn't seem to get a ton of a fanfare in the vr world, but i'm hopelessly addicted a year after my initial purchase. it doesn't hurt to have a core group of friends that play either. we do a game or two on sunday's, and sometimes fill the room almost to it's capacity of 8, and have a ton of fun with it. seriously, check that game out. it's wonderful.",neutral,0.5549735426902771,0

I got the quest 3 about 4 days ago and I almost instantly forgot that I have a gaming PC, the image quality is SPECTACULAR and I FINALLY dont get sick at fast movements. I can fire up population one and play literally until the battery dies and then still be mad that I had to stop playing. Ive never felt so immersed into games before, the hand tracking is more of a gimmick right now but those controllers are awesome. I did this really cool test in population one, they have a training area with every weapon in the game and a huge firing range. Now in most games im a self professed god tier sniper with a mouse and keyboard but in games like Apex I tend to miss shots a LOT. I grabbed this big sniper rifle in VR and got to load the mag and rack the slide and man did that ever make me happy. You get this awesome haptic feedback from the controllers and hear that bolt rack into place and then put your other hand out to cradle the rifle and then just settle right into the scope. With ZERO practice I walked up next to this guy that was missing every single shot with his single shot sniper rifle and just sighted down the scope and started nailing the center of every single target. I had to really focus down the sights and work to control my breathing and my small twitches because its so sensitive to every little movement. You have to find the target, sight down the scope, control your breathing, steady your arms, and squeeze the trigger just like a real gun. Ive pulled off some insane mile shots where I had to thread a gap and the amount of control I had to have to keep that sight right where I needed it was insanity. You can put your arm out and turn the gun every which way, I can pick up an smg and move while shooting at someone 90 degrees to the right of me, I can peek around corners, I can crouch and hide, I can turn the gun sideways and play gangsta if I want, the headset and controllers just know what you want to do and its so immersive. I get a little sick because im utterly terrified of heights when I climb but the second im up and standing it passes. Now when im climbing way up I have a tendency to just pause and look to the sides of me to just enjoy the view. I mean can most of us even remember the last time we played a game and just stopped to enjoy the scenery? Assassins creed was probably the last time I did that, the one where you play a Spartan, this thing constantly has me stopping to just say wow and then im right back into playing the soldier calling out as im clearing rooms with my squad. Then im over playing at the VR tables and talking to random people, or im off to play Bait and go fishing at a lake somewhere, or maybe I go into Meta Horizons and visit new worlds that have tons of interactive activities. I can fish and ride a boat around in one world, fly paper airplanes in another, its just endless. Theres so much stuff to do and then they have a subscription that gives you 2 free games every month that your subscribed and the games are like $30 each. I will not be returning this headset at all, its more fun than my PC and believe me im the most anti console person you could probably find, I hate being forced to upgrade to get access to new releases but VR is just so FUN. Its one thing to be involved in the story or run around in Apex but its another monster entirely when the gun is in your hands and you can hear the enemies footsteps around you on different kinds of materials, poke your head out and get blasted by a sniper hiding in a tower. Its dynamic and so real, its like a neverending game of laser tag or airsoft that you dont have to wait months to do and pay hundreds of dollars.",returned quest quickly bought didnt like controller

And i mean, i cant complain, because that's where the money is because they've been shifting that way for quite a while anyway. What i thought was worth noticing is how fascinating that shift is, when theres also such a solid userbase in PCVR experiences. And i mean, yeah... this can still ""play"" them, but when they designed this thing, let's be real- it was not with ANY consideration to Quest Link's existence. They made a lot of small sacrifices with this headset in pursuit of grander things that are probably more considerable to the typical user, that almost completely don't apply to Quest Link and PCVR at all, with the exception of the FoV.

2024-03-30,"I'm highly considering upgrading from my OG Vive to this. I can't believe it costs almost a third of what I paid for the Vive in 2016 while being such a great headset. Although it sounds like the tracking won't be as good as Vive base stations, I find that it's worth the sacrifice since I hate setting up the Vive. it takes so long to plug everything in on the Vive so I play it a lot less since I need a huge time slot to commit. With this, I can jump in and out much quicker.

2024-09-01,"My problem with this headset is:
I am a PCVR user. I don't have an overpowered PC so I can play stardew valley........ y'know?
That said, when I'm in the market for a VR, I want it to handle PCVR and anything beyond that is plain unnecessary and will never get used by someone like me.
This means the battery pack, the CPUs, the everything is all a waste of money.
Why can't we go back and revisit PCVR exclusively? Headsets could be lighter, cheaper, and you can actually get away with higher specs at the cost of not having all that extra unnecessary stuff also built in.
That's just my view point, personally, as I own a quest 2 and NEVER use it as a quest. It is exclusively just a wireless PCVR headset, except that because of quest link, barely even works half the time. I had to go buy external, aftermarket software, VirtualDesktop, to get a reliable connection. It's whack that I have to do that though when Quest Link is an advertised feature. It just simply doesn't fucking work half the time and I even went so far as getting a dedicated higher-end router specifically to host my quest's connection to PC.
That's insane to me.
Wireless is cool, I guess, but it just simply doesn't make up for all the issues I have with quest link software, plus, even wired it has the exact same connection issues.

It gets EVEN WORSE when you consider that I run a rx 7900xt GPU, WHICH to those of you that don't know, is not even SLIGHTLY supported by Quest Link, so since upgrading my GPU I've been unable to use the quest link AT ALL, let alone as unreliably as before with an rtx 3090.
It's completely assinine.

I don't care how good this headset is, Meta will not get anymore of my money as they have spat on me as a customer just about every chance they've gotten. I've never felt more ripped off by a supposedly professional corporation. I'd expect this kind of behavior out of some cheap china knock off scam service or something....... but not Meta. 

Even before all that, the performance of Quest link straight up sucked.

It bothers me that you're giving this thing so much credit, Linus. As my entire experience with the quest 2 made me just feel ripped off so bad that I don't even want to give the pro or the 3 a chance.. because my problem was never with the headset or hardware, but with the software and Meta themself.

This is obnoxiously long for a youtube comment, but I have strong opinions on these products.

I'm soon going to purchase an Index, but I've been patiently waiting to see if something new/better would come out first............ It fucking sucks that the index, from yeaaaaars ago, is still the leading PCVR headset. This has GOT to change soon. That, or they need to drop it's price from $1000, because it's getting straight up out-classed at this point by $400 headsets that are even MOBILE.

2024-03-30,"Haven't tried the Quest 3, but from all the reviews I have seen I think that this product also made me more hyped about Apple Vision Pro. With it I could basically have an infinite number of high res monitors all around me. Probably with high color accuracy since Apple is making it. I also assume that Apple will bring some enhanced version of Sidecar so that you can use your more powerful Mac Studio to run heavy programs, while only using the Vision Pro as an Extended Reality display. (Maybe just wirelessly transferring App windows, rather the whole OS, to minimize percieved latency when turning your head?)

My biggest worry about Apple Vision Pro (and similar headsets) is comfort. Is it comfortable to do an entire work-day with these on? What about watching a 3 hour movie? Is it comfortable wearing a good headset at the same time?
I'm less worried about battery since there is the possibility for swapping batteries with the Vision Pro, and there will probably be a market for third party power accessories with higher battery capacity.


Maybe the VR revolution is less about games and 3D work, and actually just about having a portable high quality screen?
At work today I had to use Premiere Pro on a 14"" MacBook Pro without external displays. A horrible experience as I end up spending more time rearranging my workspace and finding the correct panel, rather than actually editing. A high quality Extended Reality headset connected to the same laptop would have been a fantastic experience since I could have seen more panels at the same time.
Maybe we'll buy laptops without displays in the future, just connecting a VR/XR headset instead? (NUCs with batteries?)

I tried this the ther day when i had the whole day off. I managed to spend a good 80% of my day in VR and enjoyed it. Being able to drag arounf a youtube video while making a sandwich is actually viable. Take everything i say with a grain of salt because im very accustomed to VR atp, i dont know how ot explain it but it just feels like so much less effort than the quest 2 and that has led to me using it whenever i know i have time spare. The fact that the OS isnt super buggy like the quest 2, and interestingly it feels less disconnected to the real world, less like your blindfolded, means ive been using the quest 3 more like a pair of headphones for my eyes as opposed to a console. Obviously I have been playing games which the better graphics are great for but I think the answer you were looking for is the greatly improved day to day usability. Honestly, there have been many times while using it that I caught myself thinking, if this was in just a slightly smaller form factor, with a better battery life and more viable outside, I could see this being the first gen of mass adoption VR. The Sci-Fi type, where they are just as common as earphones. The spftware would need to change to reflect that if that were the case, but if Meta chooses to go down that route, we should expect some very useable technology 2 or 3 headsets down the line.
