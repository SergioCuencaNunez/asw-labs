2024-04-17,"hope you don't use them for calls


I loved their confort, but the mic is complete trash. And not being allowed to turn off amc/ambient mode"
2024-04-17,Come back to us in 3 months when they stop connecting and have a wired jumpy issue where the sound is out of sync for a few seconds. Really annoying
2024-04-17,"Interesting, my experience is the exact opposite, the ANC on the WF-1000XM5 nowhere near as good as on the QC Ultra Earbuds."
2024-04-17,The ultras suck on calls. They are far quieter than even the cheapest earbuds. Be warned. I regret the purchase.
2024-04-17,One thing I have observed and felt. They sound too good while watching movies. Theatre like feel you get while watching the movies.
2024-04-17,Great review.
2024-04-18,"I genuinely feel like there an engineer or a lead engineer that has gotten the wrong end of the stick when developing a Bluetooth solution. Bose really need to hold someone accountable. This product had the opportunity to be amazing, but the QC2 and Ultra have these horrible issues. I see so many claiming RMA on here."
2024-04-17,"The XM5's I have, have nowhere near the ANC quality of the Bose QC U I have.
XM5's sound a little better but overall I prefer the Bose."
2024-04-17,[deleted]
2024-04-17,"Wait till they stop working, the call audio is horrible.  I recently went back to the AirPod pro 2’s"
2024-04-17,"besides anything else, which ones sound better?"
2024-04-17,"Don't care about the voice mic. The anc is very good. Had connection problems at first day but it cleared up & works well.

I heard the anc is better on the bud than the headset.
Im glad i got the bud. So portable & easier to wear in bed."
2024-04-17,"I found the ANC on my airpod prov2s better, but the Bose sound better. For the airpods falling out, i fixed that with Comply memory foam tips. I had a few issues early on with my QCU’s, but a reset fixed it as well as the latest update."
2024-04-17,it's good when they work... I'm on my 4th pair
2024-04-17,"I switched to QC Ultra from Sonys wf-1000xm4.

Utterly disappointed. The QCs are unable to make a regular phone call."
2024-04-17,How is the transparency mode?
2024-04-17,No wireless charging is a deal breaker for me.
2024-04-18,"Overpriced… 
No wireless charging, no multi pairing, sound signature is more towards the bass."
2024-04-18,"If anyone its using them on pc or android tv/chromecast I recommend using them with the dongle BT-W5 waaay better quality on aptx adaptative than SBC if you dont have an aptx compatible phone. Also perfect connection, no cuts and good range. I just got them 4 days ago and its true the bt connection its tricky when switching devices, but overall im very happy with them, I dont use it for calls tought."
2024-04-18,Ultra battery sux on immerse mode.
2024-04-18,"I have a love hate relationship with mine, the ANC is great for sure but they are so unreliable.  Currently listening to my old APP on my commute as they disconnected yet again and would not reconnect."
2024-04-18,Yeah I had connection issues with my Bose QC earbuds 2 that got worse over time but bose warranty is pretty solid. I just sent them in got the QC Ultra in return. They seem to be working well so far and I'm loving the bass. It's better than all the over ear headphones I own at the moment.
2024-04-18,"I bought them and I am not satisfied. The ANC is great for sure, but the sound is not loud enough, I tried everything, it is just not as loud as I want. And the connection problems is boring. 

For 70 euros, the soundcore liberty 4 nc are a far better choice. Bose QC 2 is to expansive for what they are"
2024-04-18,"Tip- Dont updaet the software via app. Use your laptop. Recent software update broke my QC45 and Bose is not doing anything. They want me to buy another pair of headphones. 

so never update the software. Plus if they launch a new device and also launch an update dont do it. In past Bose has intentionally worsen the noice cacncellation on QC35ii post launch of NCH700. 

  
Bose is bad with software but knows how to break your expensive (consumer grade) headphones"
2024-04-18,Don’t forget to mention that these just sound better than app2 the bass alone is miles ahead if you ask me . I got them also a week ago and instantly sold my app2
2024-04-19,Mic works great for me on calls. Have gotten no complaints in several work calls. Hearing my own voice is so much better than the original QC earbuds
2024-05-02,"AirPod Pro 2 vs Bose QC Ultra Earbuds: A Personal Comparison

After my AirPod Pro broke, I decided to explore new options. While I had enjoyed using the AirPod Pro, I struggled with the fit of the buds. This time around, I decided to try out the Bose QC Ultra earbuds, alongside the newly released AirPod Pro 2. Here’s my experience comparing both products.

Bose QC Ultra Earbuds

Fit and Comfort

The Bose QC Ultra earbuds fit comfortably, much more so than my previous AirPod Pro. They sit securely in my ears, making them ideal for extended wear, whether working out or lounging.

Audio Features

I was impressed by the ability to adjust the equalizer, allowing me to fine-tune the audio to my liking. The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is also a highlight, effectively drowning out background noise better than the AirPod Pro 2.

Immersive Audio and Connectivity

Bose offers an immersive audio experience, although I noticed occasional glitches. This inconsistency with connectivity is concerning but not a deal-breaker yet.

AirPod Pro 2

Spatial Audio

Apple’s Spatial Audio stands out, especially when watching Dolby Atmos movies on Apple TV. The soundstage is well-defined, creating an engaging listening experience.

Comparisons

While the ANC is slightly less effective than Bose’s offering, the AirPod Pro 2’s Spatial Audio and seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem give it an edge.

Conclusion

While the AirPod Pro 2 offers seamless integration and great Spatial Audio, I’m leaning toward keeping the Bose QC Ultra earbuds for their superior comfort, ANC, and adjustable EQ. However, the connectivity glitches are a concern.

I’d love to hear your thoughts. Have you had experience with either of these earbuds? How do they compare in your opinion?"
2024-05-09,An error!
2024-04-18,"I can confirmed that this mic is damn bad, even worse than my company 7year old laptop mic. My colleagues couldnt hear me clearly when in meeting, i had to switch back to laptop mic for calls. I never had issues on people hearing me on calls when i am using APP"
2024-04-17,"I have not tried the mic for call yet. Might use it tomorrow on working calls. I am curious, is there any situation where you need to turn off the anc/ambient mode? I have not turn it off in my few weeks of APP2 usage"
2024-04-17,This was literally me lol. Went from AirPods Pro to these. Lasted about 2 months before I had enough of the connecting issues. Sold them and got the AirPods Pro 2 and never looked back. Best decision ever. Shame on Bose though
2024-04-18,I have had them for 4 months now and haven’t had any issues other than left ear buzzing.

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*"
2024-07-02,Never getting Bose again…wanted them to be better than my AirPods so badly
2024-04-17,Did they replaced you a new one?
2024-04-17,"Hmmm for my case i feel the xm5 foam tips does blocked out more noise than the bose, especially higher frequencies"
2024-04-18,Yes i just got told that they cant hear me clearly by my colleagues and my family. Its bad
2024-04-18,"Yesss, i tried to watched 2012 on it! This is the one thing where i felt better than APP. Spatial audio is not as out of the head feel than bose"
2024-04-18,Thanks mate
2024-04-17,I didnt try any other tips for xm5 just the stock ones and that is enough for it to drown down the whole environment for me though
2024-04-17,Yea the QCU ANC is the best hands down
2024-04-17,"Yeaah, I think mine comes with the lastest firmware, so no issue so far yet"
2024-04-17,"Had mine for two weeks and love them. Also came from Airpods. Little mosquito type noise here and there but hasn't bothered me tremendously. These fit so much better than Airpods, and I use them for calls constantly for work and no issues, albeit inside and not outside"
2024-04-17,"I hope they dont, I saw many compliants in reddit. If not because of Airpods pro fit I wouldnt be getting this."
2024-04-17,Why would they stop working?
2024-04-18,"sameee me too, airpods sound is suck but at least i don’t have headache with connectivity and mic quality!!!"
2024-04-17,I personally feel that Airpods pro sounds better and cleaner out of the box. Bose bass is rumbly but slightly mushy compared to Airpods pro
2024-04-18,"Yeah the anc is not even close when comparing to APP. My office and home surroundings always have constructions, so the differences is obvious"
2024-04-18,Surprised me alot since APP transparency was so good. Its almost as good as APP
2024-04-18,"I guess not everyone is into wireless charging, maybe i am old school but i still wire charge everything haha. But for the premium price i think its the only tws that doesnt have wireless charging?"
2024-04-18,You should maybe check your ears .. I can’t use them on 100% way to loud 😅
2024-05-31,"Reading this as I went from AirPod pro (first gen) to QC Ultra. I like the QC ultra for comfort and noise cancelling, but the mic was so crappy I couldn’t talk to anyone outside. It amplified vehicle noises so made it impossible to have a conversation, and then there’s multiple connectivity glitches. I think I’ll be returning them."
2024-04-17,"ANC all the time puts a pressure on my ears that when not needed, i prefer to avoid. And ambient/transparecy mode, leaving aside the airpods where it really feels transparent, for the bose and all the others I tried, it feels more like an earphones boosting the external noise."
2025-01-13,"It's not shame on Bose, Apple have set such perfect standards"
2024-04-17,I’ve been having arguments with them on chat to try and get my original headphones that I used to upgrade to them back. They worked fine but they offered me $10 off a different set. I don’t even live in the states.
2024-04-18,That’s a pretty big issue for €300 headphones.
2024-04-17,I got two new sets. The last set I got were the worst! Refused to connect had to forget from devise and start pairing all over again nearly every time I used them. I eventually returned them and got a refund. They were not worth the price.
2024-04-18,"I have a set of soundcore liberty 4s, and they are quite affordable. They also have noise cancellation and are better than the Bose in every way. And twice as loud."
2024-04-17,"And that is absolutely fine. If they fit you and are comfortable for you, great.
The largest foam tip is too small for me so I had to get larger Comply foam tips.

Sony large foam tips are smaller than Azla or Comply large tips. They're more like a Medium-Large.

Bottom line.. Use whatever fits and is comfortable"
2024-09-03,Source
2024-04-17,Not a Bose engineer.  I’d get the amber and white flashing and they wound not connect anymore I’m on my 3rd set then switched back to AirPods
2024-04-17,"ok good to know. I was considering switching from the new airpods pro 2 (2nd gen) to the Bose earbuds since I love my quietcomfort ultra headphones so much, but based on your account and others I’ve read, as an apple user, you cant really beat the quality of capabilities just going with the AirPods."
2024-04-18,Lol i have good ears. its weird because with Liberty its clearly more loud
2024-04-18,"It is, although they cost me 100 USD so I can’t complain lol, great workout earbuds, very comfortable."
2024-12-17,"Mine were showing none of those disorders, all good so far (QC Ultra)."
2024-04-17,For this kind of experience definitely not worth the price. This cost $400 new in my country where Airpods pro 2 is usually on sale for $180. I hope mine doesnt have this issue
2024-04-18,The anc is better on liberty 4? Hows the fit?
2024-04-18,"Yes i agree, if APP doesnt hurt your it should be your first choice"
2024-04-18,"Or your set was broken , mine gets very loud .. I don’t use them over 70%"
2024-04-18,"They fit very well. They never come out of my ears, and are smooth and comfy. The ANC may not be better than Bose overall, but I’m I see no reason to complain. I use them daily, and I have a lot of different brand earbuds that I use. The soundcores have been some of the best I’ve ever owned."
2024-04-18,Maybe...anyway I will send them back. For me the price is not justified...
2023-11-07,"Neither are really made for sports. Some people have issues keeping AirPods Pro 2 in while running and the sweat resistance is low on both the APP2 and Ultra earbuds. The Ultra do offer multiple fin tips so you can get a more secure fit with them.

Sound quality is completely subjective. Want a more neutral sound? Go with the APP2. Want a pair of earbuds that you can EQ and make sound closer to how you want? Get the Ultra. You can technically EQ the APP2, but it’s a pain and still not the same as having a 3-band EQ in an app (there is no companion app for the APP2).

The Ultra have measurably better ANC than the APP2, but both are good. You’ll have a less buggy experience with the APP2 if you have an iPhone. They will have a rock solid connection compared to the Bose and far fewer random bugs. They’re also much smaller than the Bose, as is their charging case. They’re also $100 less than the Bose.

Really, the proper comparison is between the APP2 and QC earbuds II because the Ultra don’t really improve anything except for connectivity with Snapdragon Sound certified devices (iPhones, Galaxy phones, and Pixels aren’t certified) and immersive audio that is only a gimmick which reduces audio quality. It’s not nearly as good as what Apple does with the APP2 and iPhones/iPads/Macs. Even Apple’s “upscaling” of stereo content to spatial audio sounds better than Bose’s."
2023-11-08,"I own them both. If your priorities are sound and anc quality, then the Bose wins hands down."
2023-11-07,"Why did you tag your post as ""headphones""???"
2023-11-08,"Didn’t think I wanted ANC, bought the pro 2 since I recently switched to apple, loved the ANC, but they didn’t fit well at all, got the QC ultra and wow Bose has be listening to music that before I didn’t really enjoy, kinda understand the audio file hype…."
2023-11-08,"I have AirPods 2 usb c one , they are not good compared to Bose headphones"
2023-11-08,Ultras without hesitation.
2023-12-30,Which one is better for aeroplanes? Noice canceling and more comfortable
2024-01-13,"I used the AirPods Pro 2 (USB C) for about 2 weeks in total and my god, the left bud keeps falling out no matter what I try. I also tried the comply ear tips and they seem to worsen the ANC performance for some reason (as pointed out by many other reviewers too). I had to return them and decided to get the Bose QC Ultras as a companion to my existing Bose NC700s. I was hesitant at first since I'm deeply invested in the Apple Ecosystem. I can say, that despite the minor issues with connectivity and the lack of charging options, these are by far the best consumer audio earbuds I've tested. The sound quality is richer than the APP2 and the ANC is unparalleled. The name fittingly has comfort in it as they are super comfortable shallow-fitting earbuds that don't cause itchy ears or fatigue like the APP2 after 40 minutes. I've drained them completely in a single session of 6hrs. If something does go wrong I can vouch for Bose customer support as I have experience replacing my NC700s in the past."
2024-07-02,AirPod Pro 2. No question. Constant connection issue with Bose.. incredibly annoying mid set/while on treadmill
2024-03-18,Hi any occlusion effect on the Bose ultras? Like amplifying step sounds etc? Thanks
2024-04-04,Is there a place where you can test the Bose before buying and dropping 300 bucks.
2024-11-09,AirPods Pro 3
2024-12-07,Bum enhancing gym leggings
2023-11-08,"I have the bose quiet comfort 2 and I regret buying them.  The sound quality is good when they are working, but I am constantly having connectivity issues.   I wish I could get a refund or something but I bought them from Walmart so I don’t think that is an option.   

I carry a pair of 5 dollar wired earbuds with me to use when my bose just decide they don’t want to connect to my phone and make sound.   What a joke.   Constantly."
2023-11-08,"I'd recommend the Beats Fit Pro, they're sold by Apple too, and the design is perfect for running. The ANC is not particularly good, but for running you really don't need more, and the the transparency mode works fine."
2023-11-08,"I just use my airpods pro 2 usb-c for phone calls really and to easily switch to macbook when needed . Music, gym, etc I use the ultras"
2023-11-09,If you live in the Apple ecosystem AirPods Pro 2. They have different tip sizes that help them fit your ear better. I’ve run several marathons with them and are my primary kit working out at the gym. Never have I had them fall out or even move. I pair them to my Apple Watch Ultra and don’t even have to bring my phone into the gym or with me to the gym for that matter. Can’t speak to the Bose but they are usually great quality but wonder if they can handle the sweat from running like APP can. As an added bonus the APP is great for phone calls and if I’m home are usually the ones I grab most to make calls.
2024-02-25,The Bose may not be made for sports but are great for it. They are my perfect gym earbuds.
2024-09-28,Thank you so much!
2025-01-09,"That is a very nice review. I have used the Bose II for a long time. I love the noise canceling, especially when I would need to have hearing protection in my workshop. I can use the aware mode and they just move in with the noise canceling when I need protection. This is amazingly fast. I had some small glitches in connection sometimes but did not bother me. I used them bicycling in all weather over  2 years almost daily. When sweating a lot they tended to fall of. Finally, the left earbuds stopped working and I returned them. That said they are definitely not good when talking to some buddy even with moderate noise around. For that, I use an Oleap bow. These are amazing in their noise canceling when calling somebody. I tested them in even very heavy noise and the one I called could hear me clearly almost without any noise. They have ok sound, but not close to the APP or Bose II. They never fall of and can be used under any movement without falling out. 

I tried the APP2 from my wife, but the do not fit my ear so well, they hurt after a while and I liked the sound of the Bose slightly better."
2025-02-12,"You can keeo your Airpods Pro 2 in your ear with some cheap Rubber Ear adapters, I been using the 1st Gen and now the 2Gen with them, with no problems."
2023-11-08,"This is an excellent post regarding these 2 pairs of buds.

The one thing I will add, is that Bose buds completely seal off the ear while both APP 1 and 2 have a vent system that alleviates some (not all) of the pressure.

This leads to less occlusion effect if that bothers you (think the booming sound when you take steps with buds in your ears).

This is largely why I stick with APP2 as they are great for walking, not sure if the stability really is there for running.

Also, IMO, these new enhanced audio modes (apple spatial, bose immersive, etc.) are just gimmicks.  They create some added soundstage by pushing the channels farther left and right but compromise the sound quality of the original recording."
2024-02-02,I’ve read that the ultracomfort also have subtle but noticeable audio and call quality improvements over the QC 2s. Have you tried both and would you agree?
2023-11-08,are they also bugging like the qc 2? a lot of people say they are bugging sometimes.
2023-11-08,How much better are they on a 1-10
2024-01-17,My pro 2’s fall out all the time. With every earpiece it came with
2024-02-25,The Bose is undeniably better at ANC. Plus Apple constantly play around with the ANC with their firmware updates. Sometimes making it worse.
2024-09-30,"hi what iphone do you use, i’m planning to buy airpods pro 2 but im also eyeing on bose qc 2 for the noise cancellation"
2024-11-22,Yes big time
2024-04-05,You can return the product within 14 days almost every store has this policy.
2023-12-05,File a warranty repair online and they’ll upgrade you to ultra.
2023-11-08,I love these just wish the anc was better
2024-02-25,Hated the wing tip
2024-12-18,"how do you use airpods with usb-c, my pods are to small to even have a usb-c to connect to a phone"
2025-02-12,"I’m not doing that. I refuse to use something I have to take off every single time I put the earbuds in their case only to put back on before using them. If I have to do that, the earbuds aren’t for me."
2023-11-08,"One thing I’ve noticed from the QC earbuds 2 to the Ultra is less of the occlusion issue. Going back, I haven’t heard my footsteps while using them. I have yet to run in a treadmill or concrete with them. But that has been a big improvement. I keep giving the Ultra earbuds a hard time but, aside from the gimmicky immersive audio, they’ve been performing more solid than any pair of QC earbuds 2 I’ve owned (probably 4-5 at this point) with zero full disconnects, only a handful of audible blips or bloops (well within the norm for true wireless earbuds), and not hearing the occlusion issue.

I’m still not sure they’re worth $300, especially when no set of true wireless earbuds have the same stability as AirPods Pro 2 on modern iPhones, but the small touches have helped justify the cost."
2025-01-11,Occlusion effect pisses me off no end so I think this comment just made my decision for me
2024-02-02,"I had people complaining about not hearing me with both. In the end, I sold my QC Ultra earbuds because they started experiencing connectivity problems and the mosquito buzzing in the left earbud never went away. I didn’t want to go through yet another exchange/repair process through Bose after going through so many with the QC earbuds 1 and II. I’m just using my AirPods Pro 2 with foam ear tips. The ANC seems on par enough with Bose, audio quality is fine after taking a listening test, and they’re much more solid with my iPhone not to mention easier device switching not requiring a factory reset every single time."
2023-11-08,"As of now, no. I also owned QC2 and didn’t find them buggy at all. I’m not sure if it’s because I was one of the lucky ones or it’s just that negative comments are much louder."
2024-06-02,"Same here, just one esr though"
2024-02-29,[removed]
2023-11-08,That’s pretty much the state of the art though… as far as I know there is nothing better.
2024-12-18,Meant the AirPods Pro usb-c version they had just come on at the time bs the lightning charger not actually connected with usb-c
2023-11-09,"That's quite interesting, both my wife and I had the QC buds 1, and while they had some real positives, the occlusion from them was next level.  I couldn't even walk with them in, it was that bad.

That said, when 2 came out I did my due diligence reading reviews trying to see if Bose had done anything to alleviate the occlusion.  I could not find one piece of evidence that they had, so I did not move on them.

While I really like the APP2 for a number of reasons, even bose QC 1 have better overall noise isolation, I still use them for mowing the lawn."
2025-02-26,"Bose qc ultra and app2 
Bose qc much better"
2024-03-25,"This. I sold my ultras because people couldn't hear me over (admittedly) significant background noise, more complaints than qc ii. no complaints so far with app 2"
2024-02-09,"I ended up returning the QC ultra buds.. same issues with connectivity, Bluetooth disconnecting (especially on the train), one bud disconnecting.. it’s too bad because they do sound amazing and ANC is excellent too. But I just couldn’t justify paying $250 only to have them disconnect on the regular"
2024-02-09,"Bose has at least two generations of earbuds before I try them again. Each iteration gets somewhat better, but they still haven’t figured out Bluetooth despite working directly with Qualcomm. They always crap the bed with their Bluetooth. First by not making them connect independently, then by still making them buggy. I’ll try the QC earbuds 4 in 4-5 years. Until then, I’ll stick with my AirPods Pro 2 and probably the 3 next year. They may not have quite the ANC as Bose, but I’ve never once had connectivity issues or need to factory reset my earbuds just to go from my iPhone to work or Windows handheld and to my MacBook Pro (or have people complaining about not hearing me in quiet rooms)."
2024-07-04,"Are you still sticking with the AirPods Pro 2 after returning the Ultra? I have the mosquito noise in the left earbud and am still within the return window. Not sure what to exchange them for, as I really like the PNI/ANC on these... please let me know"
2024-02-25,They do connect independently!
2024-07-04,"I ended up going to the Denon PerL Pro and the Sony WF-1000XM5. The Sony have better ANC for traveling (about 98% Bose-level, more than the AirPods Pro 2) while the Denon wipes the floor with all of them in terms of sound quality, but their ANC is “only” on par with the AirPods Pro 2. I’m trying to decide if I can take a step back in ANC and just keep the Denon, or if I want both.

It’s a shame Bose crapped the bed with their true wireless earbuds. The Ultra have everything going for them, except they should last more than 6 hours on a charge, their case should have Qi charging built-in, and they shouldn’t have nearly this many bugs. The cheap Soundcore events I have in my office I spent $30 on have smoother operation."
2024-07-05,"Thank you so much for the reply, I just returned my Bose and got myself a pair of XM5 at Best Buy! Stoked. Writing this as I’m on the subway!
Noise isolation is pretty huge for me overall, so I’d rather get the XM5 but the Denon are definitely quite interesting, though."
2024-09-28,What earphones for Teams Calls and noise canceling for axx)9@;3/ that don't know how to stop talking about non-work stuff in front of my cube? I need something asap! The bose over the ear? The earbuds? AirPod pros?
2024-07-05,"My only issue with the Sony is that they rely on their hybrid foam ear tips and foam is never my favorite. I’ve tried swapping them out for rubber, but their ANC tastes a step back because it relies on getting that seal. The Denon comes with foam ear tips as well and, with them, ANC is about equal. So they both rely on isolation to boost their ANC whereas Bose just has outstanding ANC.

I don’t commute and rarely fly anymore so having the absolute best ANC isn’t a concern for me. I’ve been focusing more on audio quality and products that have good enough ANC. I would have put up with Bose’s crap if I frequently traveled. Even then, I think the Sony sounds better. Their EQ is more robust and they clear bass+ is something else from Sony."
2024-09-28,"Nothing from Bose if Teams calls are a priority. Their earbuds have trash microphones. AirPods Pro 2 are solid, Sony WF-1000XM5, even various earbuds from JBL have better mic quality."
2024-07-05,"Just tested the XM5 right now, you're right, it all depends on the seal you get from the tips. If I open my mouth the ANC stops working lol. But I ain't ever going back to the Bose, that mosquito noise in the left ear is absolutely unbearable when it's the only thing you hear.

Maybe there are better hybrid tips that can be bought from Amazon? I quickly checked and found a couple ones, might try them out.."
2024-07-09,"Have you tried the Airpods Pro 2? ANC on XM5 is nearly non existent. Any thoughts?

Also - received my Airfoams Pro (silicone shielded foam) tips today. Not good. The fit is just as bad as stock in my right ear, won't be using them. Do you have any suggestions? Would be much appreciated!"
2024-07-05,"I have a couple of backup tips. Some are just rubber, others are all foam. Anything with foam just doesn’t feel comfortable in my ears after a while. Even Complyfoam tips on the AirPods Pro 2 would just feel itchy after a while. They also put more pressure in my canals than rubber ones do.

I may just keep both sets of earbuds. One for travel and noisy environments, the other for general use. The Sony didn’t cost me anything, they were a review pair. I only paid for the Denon when they were on sale."
2024-07-09,"ANC on the WF-1000XM5 is measurably better than the AirPods Pro 2. If you aren’t getting proper ANC performance on the XM5, something is wrong. Either you’re not getting a good seal (take the fit test), they’re not in ANC mode, or you have a defective unit.

But yes, I’ve tried the AirPods Pro 2 and they don’t stay in my ears. They do if I use foam ear tips but, if I’m going to do that, I might as well use Sony for the longer battery life, much better sound quality (that you can EQ, you can’t EQ AirPods), and better ANC."
2024-07-05,"I'd keep both! especially if the Sony didn't cost you anything.

Did you try a hybrid tip? Like this one: AirFoams Pro Universal Memory Foam Ear Tips w/Silicone Shield Patented for Sony WF-1000XM5 [https://www.charjenpro.com/products/airfoamsprouniversal](https://www.charjenpro.com/products/airfoamsprouniversal)

It looks like it's foam + a silicone shield. 

I also wonder if I can add wings / ear hooks to the XM5, like I did in the early days with my wired Apple EarPods. Something like this? [https://a.co/d/0bAOlQVD](https://a.co/d/0bAOlQVD)"

2024-07-09,Are you able to get a good seal with the xm5 using the stock tips? Which ones do you use otherwise?
2024-07-09,"I’m can. My ears pass Sony’s fit test every time with the stock large ear tips. Comfort is an issue after a while due to the foam and the right earbud requires some initial adjustment just because of my ear shape, but their stock ear tips work.

That’s one advantage Bose had: you just put their earbuds in and move on. No fiddling with expanding foam. Just put them in and twist. Terribly buggy though. I’m actually going to order her Denon Perl Pro on Prime Day. They have a funky design, but I’ve read that their audio quality is like no other pair of true wireless earbuds because of their ability to tune themselves to your ear shape. They acoustically measure your ears and gauge the best response for them. I’ll see if they sound better than the XM5 and gauge their level of ANC."
2024-07-10,"Don’t you already own the Denon PerL Pro????? In your own words: « I ended up going to the Denon PerL Pro and the Sony WF-1000XM5. The Sony have better ANC for traveling (about 98% Bose-level, more than the AirPods Pro 2) while the Denon wipes the floor with all of them in terms of sound quality, but their ANC is “only” on par with the AirPods Pro 2. I’m trying to decide if I can take a step back in ANC and just keep the Denon, or if I want both.«"
2024-07-10,"I have a review pair, yes. But I’m going to buy them on Prime Day to keep them."
2024-07-10,"That contradicts what you said above, you said ""I’ll see if they sound better than the XM5 and gauge their level of ANC."" meaning you don't have them yet. That's very suspicious mate."
2024-07-10,"Ok, whatever. I’m actively reviewing multiple pairs of earbuds and still going back and forth about which ones I’m going to buy out just keep my XM5. Think whatever you want, I don’t care."
2024-07-10,"no worries. I'm just trying to seek out the truth about Airpods Pro 2 vs XM5. The ANC may be measurably better but the fit on the XM5 is so bad for me, that I'm strongly considering trying out the Airpods. 

You said the XM5 L size fit was perfect right from the start, for you. Did it require any break in? I can M or even L size to fit provided I push really deeply. But they fall out of my right ear pretty fast after a couple seconds. I can't see how they can stick in there when I'm walking or even running."
2024-07-10,"Which is fine. But both earbuds have also been out for a while so there are plenty of written and video reviews available to help make your decision. There isn’t a right or wrong, just whatever fits you the best. The AirPods Pro 2 didn’t fit me, not without using different tips that required squeezing every single time I put them in my ears. I didn’t want to do that so I switched to the XM5, this was all after trying Bose multiple times.

I didn’t have any break in period with the ear tips. I do find that I need to really shove them in my ears, my right ear will start pushing out that one, and I need to shove it in again or else it will feel like it’s hanging on for dear life."
2024-07-10,"Well I have the exact same issue you just described. I’ve ordered the new Sony replacement tips (new revision from 5 months ago) that apparently use rubber or something, should be here today. I’ll let you know if those are better. https://sony.encompass.com/item/14800462/Sony/A-5070-546-A/"
2024-07-10,"That’s interesting, though I’m not sure how they’re different from the stock XM5 ear tips which are already a hybrid foam/rubber setup. They have a thin layer of foam over rubber. The picture wasn’t loading for me so they might be different.

I didn’t straight rubber ear tips and they fit fine, just ANC introduced. Sony’s ANC heavily relies on the physical isolation of their foam tips. Rubber has less isolation, so the ANC struggled for me. It was about on par with the AirPods Pro 2 when using rubber tips. So not bad, but reduced nonetheless."
2024-07-14,"received the replacement tips after several delays by FedEx (canada), they are simple silicone tips as far as I can tell, maybe there's some rubber thrown in there, not sure. But no foam and it's all hollow. Fit is much better than stock, but still falls out of my ear regardless after a couple seconds when looking down. like 50-70% better, but not quite where I'm happy with them..."
2024-10-12,I have also updated it to 4.0.20. Everything is good but this mosquito noise is still there and very annoying. Like if I put it in quiet mode it’s very much there only if I play some music it’s not heard.
2024-10-12,Sorry but why has everyone forgotten the Jabra Elite 8 and 10s?
2024-10-12,"The case size is so smaller than those other two as well, the Sony is huge and they don't fold, and Apples is just messy."
2024-10-12,"Hey guys, I added some very important information regarding multipoint connectivity to the OP via an Edit - please do check it out. I was watching Fredo Heavy's review on the multipoint and realized that he doesn't know how the multipoint works!"
2024-10-12,"ahh shame, perhaps it is an hardware issue that they finally bothered to fix? my device was manufactured in July 2024...when was yours?

also, it is due to the mosquito-noise issue that I bought mine from the official store because I feel that the retailers sell the official products for cheaper because they may be the units returned by dissatisfied users and then the official stores load them off to the retailers!"
2024-10-12,"personally, they were never on my radar as they didn't turn up on my YouTube searches for best ANC"
2024-10-12,"sorry, I don't agree...the Apple case is significantly better in every aspect than the Bose one - it is more compact, sturdy, and lightweight!

the Bose case, on the other hand, is huge, heavy, and bulky! 

I have not seen the Sony case so no comments on that."
2024-10-12,Makes sense regarding the retailers and official store thing.
2024-10-12,Look at rtings and soundguys
2024-10-12,"The Apple one offers poor protection, it's one of the worst aspects and gets heavily criticised because of this.

The Bose is case is one of the smallest on the market, I'm really not sure why you think it's huge. They are the only headphones that fold up unlike the Apple, Sennheiser, Sony etc. They are a much smaller case

2024-10-12,"interesting, I did a search and apparently some YouTubers claim they are better than Ultras for ANC while some don't think so...I guess the Jabra are very close if they're compared - I think I'd have still went with Bose though because it is more recognizable and reputed...my first choice was APP2 as I'm deep in the Apple ecosystem - the only reason that I even looked at Ultras was due to the extreme ear-pressure I feel with APP2!"
2024-10-12,my post is regarding the \*earbuds\* !!
2025-02-07,"I own both and I use them for different things. Airpods pro 2 for gym, shopping and watch TV in silent (Apple TV), and the bose qc ultra when I'm on the computer.
Love both."
2025-02-07,"Wild because I just posted a video about this comparison and Im happy to hear that we had about the same outlook compared to the APP2!  
Another thing to add is the call quality seems like APP2 beats it there but doesnt seem like QC is THAT bad

Great Points!"
2025-02-08,"Does anyone with QC Ultra Earbuds have excessive hiss (white noise) (even with ANC disabled)? 

I purchased two sets in Lunar Blue and they both had a poor noise floor. Turning off quiet mode and creating a custom mode with ANC off only reduced it slightly. 

I ended up returning but otherwise really liked them."
2025-02-08,"I just got mine 2 weeks ago. I dropped and scuffed the case, so idk if I can return them. I feel like I will use my Bose because I spent so much on them, but overall feel like it wasn’t worth the upgrade. I would tell past me that I like them but don’t $300 like them."
2025-02-09,"The trouble with multipoint is that it was designed for phone call convenience a long time ago but potentially at the cost of music audio quality today. There can be an issue with the requirement to use a codec in common across all devices while multipoint is in effect. Although not if you’re AAC across the board (with Windows 11 or Windows 10 + 3rd party AAC driver).

People would be better off connecting the QCUE’s to a FiiO BT11 (or Creative BT-W6) alone when wishing to listen to music. I wouldn’t compare these two earbuds without doing this (or testing them with a smartphone capable of aptX Lossless). I wonder if your sound quality assessment would change any. aptX Lossless would put back the mid and high frequency content AAC drops.

https://preview.redd.it/j05h2coxy4ie1.jpeg?width=2732&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c1d07ed61a9ece170b9676ad38e30f9d50882b80"
2025-02-10,"transparency is def air pods, so if you use that it is a big consideration point"
2025-02-07,Same here. I still use APP2 for my Apple Watch (runs) and for my Apple TV. As it’s just that much easier to connect the APP2 to them compared to the QC.
2025-02-08,Mine hiss for the first 10 seconds. Then they stop.
2025-02-08,I paid €230 for them. €300 would be too much for me as well.
2025-02-09,"To be honest, I’m nearing 40 and I doubt I would reliably hear the difference between codecs."
2025-02-09,"I’m 47. We only lose the ability to hear high frequency sounds starting about 50. You can check your current ability via YouTube and someone has gathered them [here](https://decibelhearing.com/hearing-loss-overview/high-frequency-hearing-loss/). I don’t think there’s a lot happening up at those frequencies in most music. I could hear the 12K but I couldn’t hear the 15K.

The frequencies up to 15K that are missing in AAC, often form details of certain instruments and vocals.

There’s a myth perpetuation about only a small number of people being able to tell the difference. This is usually based on very small samples, like 500 people, or the results of random YouTubers’ tests, or the words of Apple’s marketing writers. Much of which was said over a decade ago, not considering advancements in drivers today. Neither would form the basis for a scientific fact. 

It would largely depend on the ability of the headphone/earphone to resolve the detail but also your familiarity with the music. It’s not something you just take random samples and give it a go. It’s songs you’ve known for years. I remember actually picking up on it with the QCUE’s for the first time. It’s a bit like a subtle muffling you get with AAC. Often described as a veil. You don’t know that you’re missing something until you have heard the lossless version on the same equipment. I realised something was wrong and that’s when I discovered Apple Music had glitched and was sending me the AAC version of a song I’d known for most of my life. It is subtle though. The likes of my casual music fan mother, wouldn’t care even if she did detect it.

So, for some people, it’s not a big deal. This is where the difference comes in. For someone that loves a particular artist, they’re going to want to dig for that extra detail they never knew was there. It can be rewarding and some even find it moving. It is not placebo and anyone saying that is simply inexperienced pretending they’re not. I’d actually say the placebo is the other way around. When you haven’t heard it, you don’t know that it exists. I was oblivious myself with the original and QCEII’s. To be fair though, the QCUE’s are not the ideal tool for picking out the distinction. It would be better to have a multi-driver IEM or over-ear recognised for being highly resolving. It wasn’t until I got my first IEM’s that this whole other world opened up to me. A lot of it is “ear/brain training” but when you know, you know. There’s no going back."
2024-11-24,"I chose the Ultra for the ANC, my primary requirement. Independent tests online show its ANC is much better than the QC, so I went with that. The Apple was tempting but too far out of my budget.

In my own testing, the ANC is excellent, and the sound is great for music, atmospheric and a real life sensation for movies (like they’re in the room with me), and terrible for ebooks."
2024-11-24,"I bought the Bose Quiet Comfort earbuds last week and I returned them after 2 days.

I had lots of connection issues. One earbud would suddenly turn off. Sometimes the left..sometimes the right. I couldn't get a comfortable fit. I'm also not used to earbuds and I think I have smaller ears. 

That's just my experience. A lot of reviews say they are great though."
2024-11-25,Airpods have no connectivity issues
2024-11-24,"You’re comparing apples and oranges. 

But I will say the APP2 are one of the greatest purchases I’ve made. If you have Apple Products it’s a no brainer. I use them everywhere. I don’t even travel with over ear headphones anymore because the ANC on the APP2 are good enough and they’re obviously way more portable. 

If you can afford both, they would complement each other well. Over-ear for when you’re working or watching movies. In-ear for when you’re on the go."
2024-11-24,"I don’t have the Bose earbuds (only headphones) so I can’t speak for those, but I do have the Apple AirPods 2. 
They are great for listening to music especially if you are using other apple products like the iPhone and Mac. If you are using them on non-apple products, I personally have noticed a difference in sound quality especially on computers, there is slightly more static noise and it’s not as clear. 
As for phone calls, people who call me say they sometimes hear a really loud screeching sound before connecting and I have had several instances of it not connecting completely and the other person not being able to hear me talk. So for call I just disconnect them. 
Again this is only speaking for the AirPods! Hope this helps a little bit."
2024-11-25,Why choose? I bought both the QuietComfort headphones and the AirPods Pro 2 earbuds last week. They both do things I need the other doesn’t. The AirPods will be used a lot more though.
2024-11-25,Bose
2024-11-25,"I’ve had both the quiet comfort and the AirPod pros. The AirPods don’t stay in my ears well. They are nice for what they are but the Bose headphones are way way better.

I didn’t get the ultras because I read to many complaints. If I tried a pair and they were way quieter I’d prolly be bummed."
2024-11-25,"If anc is a big priority then definitely Bose, the anc is way better. There are videos on YouTube and articles that compare anc, sound quality, and test things like bass and treble. I recommend looking into those if you can’t choose"
2024-11-25,"I loved the QuietComfort back in the day but they are the same now, right? Micro USB to charge, outdated Bluetooth version, same price as before? That’s just insulting to technologically minded people. Give us a spec bump, add USB C and I’d get those. Otherwise, I prefer the Quiet Comfort Ultras.

Airpods Pro 2 are…earbuds, right? You are asking about the difference between over-ear earphones vs earbuds? The AirPods Pro are frankly one of the best inventions that have come along in my lifetime, but you can’t compare them to over ear headphones."
2024-11-25,"I have the Bose QC Ultra Earbuds and the Apple Airpods Pro 2 (for my wife).

Fit: Both are comfortable. But I'd say Ultra is better because after using it for a while, I sometimes forgot I was wearing the earbuds. Apple is deeper into the ear canal so you'll always feel it, however they are light -- no big deal.

ANC: Ultra blows Apple out of water. No contest there. When my range hood is on high, Ultra blocks everything but there's still quite a bit from Apple. 

Sound quality: I'd say the Apple sounds more balanced out of box. Bose is heavier on the bass, which I don't prefer. However, I use the wavelet app on Android to EQ it back to a balanced profile. When doing so there isn't too much difference. 

Connectivity: I noticed the Bose would occasionally turn off in one of the ear as well. It's annoying but doesn't happen very often. There is sometimes the statics and electronics noise from the left bud, personally I'm okay with it. 

Personally I'd pick Bose Ultra. But hey you can buy both of them :)

As for Bose QC -- they are not comfortable for me so I tried and returned them. 

Edit: grammar"
2024-11-25,"Based on that you are into apple, apple will be much more consistent, stable choice. Apple has better touch controls, 0 hiss on ANC mode, better sound quality imo. Bose has better ANC and may fit better"
2024-11-25,AirPods Pro 2 are the ones to go for. The Bose earbuds go wrong all the time.
2024-11-25,"I have both, I would tell you to get the AirPods Pro 2, they are more versatile, you can use them at the gym, for going out, at home... they are more comfortable as they are earphones. I always use AirPods Pro 2 for the gym and to leave the house and at home I only use Bose QC Ultra. As for the sound, Bose will have more bass and the AirPods will have more treble. trust me, get the earphones also because they don’t keep you as hot as the Bose ones (also think about summer) and they clearly cost half the price ahahaha"
2024-11-25,I have found that Bose has really poor life to their products and they fall apart in one or two years.  I have JBL and they are half the price and are going strong after 3 years.  Everything Bose look and sound good off the shelf but have to be replaced in a few years as they will stop working.  To me they are built with poor quality in general
2024-11-25,"Do not buy the bose.  I bought mine a month ago and I'm stuck with them.  Yes they are great sound, yes they have superior ANC but they are completely ruined by the over sensitive touch that will stop and start your music when you don't want it to and you cannot turn off."
2024-11-25,"I just brought the Bose quiet, comfort ultra, and they are the best headphones I’ve ever owned so much so that I sold my AirPods Pro because in ear earbuds no longer work for me. They caused too much pain with my allergy ears so I would go for the ultras. The sound quality is awesome. The noise canceling is just fine and they’re the most comfortable headphones I’ve ever owned. Hope this helps."
2024-12-27,"I have both and late to this. Got Bose as a Christmas present from parents. I’ve had AirPods forever. The Bose actually sound a lot better on a call. People have trouble hearing me on work calls using AirPods. I also have a Dell laptop. Hoping these help. Likely use Bose for the gym, work calls and traveling. Walking around likely AirPods. The sound quality with music is far superior imo. 

I plan to keep them because it was a gift and I’m a 42 year old man who can buy what he wants. If I was younger and had to pick as an iPhone owner, get the AirPods."
2024-11-24,"Oh nice, thanks for this. I hope you don't mind if I ask you more:

\- some say they experience a hiss with the ANC. What's your experience?

\- how stable are they in the ear? 

\- is it true that the bass is a bit too much and can it be taken to a comfortable place with the equalizer? 

\- I listen to a lot of genres from rock, pop and punk to indie folk and kpop and even latin cumbia. Would it be ok for that?"
2024-11-24,"Thanks. Lot of people say that they get foam buds, regardless of Bose or Apple."
2024-11-25,"All of my problems were fixed by tweaking the settings I wanted. Then just... uninstalling the app completely. No popping sounds/disconnections. Sound distortions, and whatnot. But, I still have an issue with the white noise coming out of the bose qc ultras than the sony wf-1000xm4s (previous pair before battery drain issues forced me to return them)"
2024-11-24,"Thanks for your perspective on the APP2. I originally added the links, the QC I linked are also in-ear buds, just like the APP2."
2024-11-24,"It helps, thanks! I only use Apple devices so that would be ok. I did saw tests that calls on AirPods Pro 2 is significantly better than on Bose because of their mics."
2024-11-25,"The QC I was after are in-ear, I added the links from the start to clear confusion since I know there are headphones too with the same model name."
2024-11-25,"What is your experience in calls with the bose earbuds in noisy environments such as dog barkings,working construction or busy streets?do smart calls improve the calls?"
2024-11-25,"Oh What is your experience in calls with the bose earbuds in noisy environments such as dog barkings,working construction or busy streets?do smart calls improve the calls?"
2024-11-25,"I'm disappointed at the amount of white noise I'm hearing. It's annoying, when you are in a naturally quiet room, bose punches out non existent white noise"
2024-11-25,"I read a lot about the hiss, and it seems all Bose have it. I ultimately ended up buying the AirPods Pro 2. Thank you!"
2024-11-25,"Hi, 

- No hissing
- Stable in the ear
- Bass and treble can easily be adjusted in the app
- Music has been great so far, I listen to pop and rock"
2024-11-24,"oh sorry my bad. in that case, its all preference.

connectivity: if you own a bunch of apple products, this is no contest. if you don't then you can probably pick either and be happy. maybe the bose is better for general connectivity, but the apple ecosystem is unparalleled. 

sound: subjective. idk how the bose sound, but the APP2 sound great enough imo.

ANC: i have no complaints with the APP2. theyre good enough. i cant speak on the bose. probably splitting hairs.

transparency mode: i heard the APP2 are the best. i would agree with this because i often forget i'm wearing them

comfort: subjective. some don't like the APP2 tips. to me theyre comfortable and light.

portability: APP2 case is objectively smaller."
2024-11-25,I'd suggest the airpods pro 2 since it can read notifications from your iPhone.  I find it helpful when i'm listening to a podcast during an activity and an incoming messages comes in and you can seamlessly use airpods among your apple devices.
2024-11-25,I would still do what I did!😉😊
2024-11-25,I bought them on Thursday. The only calls I have done have been in my home.
2024-11-25,I later realized this thread was on the buds I have the over ear quiet comfort.
2024-11-25,Thanks a lot!
2024-11-24,Thanks! Ended up buying the APP2 now :) Fingers crossed. I guess both are on par. I'm only worried about not having an equalizer. We'll see.
2024-11-25,fwiw spotify (probably apple music too) has a built in equalizer
2024-11-25,also you should order from costco if you can. that way you have an infinite return policy in case the warranty sucks
2024-11-25,I live in Hamburg 🇩🇪so no CostCo here. Thanks for the tip on the equalizer. I don’t think I have ever seen it in the Spotify app for iPhone 🧐
2024-11-24,I’ve had both. Get the AirPods Pro 2.
2024-11-24,"The Bose ones have maybe a little better NC but one of the buds has a really annoying his sound and the connectivity while using multipoint is trash. They stutter pretty often or randomly stop playing. 

I had the Sony xm5, the Bose Ultras and the AirPods Pro 2, and the AirPods are the best all round package when using an iPhone or the Apple ecosystem in general."
2024-11-24,"The Bose look bigger, uglier and heavier. But I am pretty sure they have better noise cancellation even though I have never used them"
2024-11-25,If iPhone -> Airpods
2024-11-25,AirPods if on iPhone. Switching devices doesn’t work very well on Bose and they are less reliable.
2024-11-25,"Well you didn't say what you will be connecting them to.

If you use Apple gear, it's actually kind of a silly question."
2024-11-25,"I have AP2 Pros and Quiet Comfort Ultras, both great choices. Pro2’s have better ANC when used with memory foam tips and are better for working out. The Bose do sound amazing too, but if in the  ecosystem I recommend the Apple Pros."
2024-11-25,"Can't go wrong with either, but I'd probably give the edge to the AirPods Pro 2 just for that Apple integration"
2024-11-25,"Have both, use the Bose for gaming on my iPad basically exclusively. AirPods Pro 2 are better in every way except noice cancellation but it’s very marginal (The Bose was a gift I wouldn’t buy it)"
2024-11-25,I just got them! It’s going to be good or terrible! We’ll see!
2024-11-24,Thanks for the info! I read a lot of people mentioning the hiss. What keeps me from getting the AirPods Pro 2 is the lack of an equalizer. How did you go about it?
2024-11-25,But everyone and their dog wears airpods
2024-11-25,I bought some memory foam tips to go with them. They stay in my ears well.
2024-12-14,"I have to say, that I like the sound of AirPods Pro 2 even without a EQ. Meanwhile I listen all audio with 3D-Audio/Immersive Audio enabled because I like the brighter soundstage and the audio profile. I would even go that far to say, that the APP2 are some of the best sounding earbuds for regular non audiophile people like the most of us. A good mix of all frequencies without overemphasising the low or loosing the highs or mids. Really great headphones"
2024-11-25,What’s that supposed to mean? I have the AirPods Pro 1 and 2. They are not ugly or heavy. Are you saying they’re heavy? Or are you saying that he should choose the QC because way too many people have the pods? If so I actually think it’s a good idea to stand out from the crowd. I think his options should be AirPods Pro 2 or Sony WXM 5 earbuds.
2024-11-25,Just saying its s sea of airpods in this world so if you want to try something different the Quiet Comforts work well
