2024-03-29,Woah. This right here may be a very big moment in our timeline
2024-03-29,"The FaceTime call was impressive. You can tell that it's not 1 to 1 with a real video feed of yourself, but it's damn impressive how close it gets. I was expecting cartoon like emoji like but wow!"
2024-03-29,"11:06 MKBHD does the double thumb up emoji in facetime is the best part of this demo, love it"
2024-03-29,"25 Years From Now This Will Be A Very Specific, Nostalgic And Interesting Video In Our Timeline."
2024-03-29,Everytime Justine unboxes a new apple product she becomes a 10 year old all over again
2024-03-29,I honestly don't know how you are so energetic in all of these unboxing videos. It really is a skill. Still going strong after all of these years!
2024-03-29,Absolutely insane. Would be cool to see how you integrate the Vision Pro into your workflow like with editing and content creation
9  ago,The Vision Pro is a masterpiece of technology that doesn’t necessarily benefit users as much as computers in a computer world. It’s great technology that really hits the mark
2024-03-29,"I still don't personally want or need one, but seeing your childlike joy brought me a lot of joy. So thank you for that."
2024-03-29,"Apple couldn't ask for a more enthusiastic commercial spokesperson for everything they make. Getting that excited over a polishing cloth really is a special skill. Her ability to fawn (especially over unboxing), along with the quality of her videos is a gift."
2024-03-29,"I've watched Marques's and The Verge's video about it before this one. Your video is the only one that shows off a lot about this headset, compared to others. The childlike wonder I experience just watching this. Thank you for your positive energy, Justine!"
2024-03-29,"MKBHD: Calling it VR, calling the headset heavy, calling the battery heavy, ""wall brick not super fast"", calling it expensive, ""that might get a little uncomfortable""; ""do I look ridiculous?""
iJustine: ""It truly feels like you are witnessing a miracle"" 1:23"
2024-03-29,Can't wait for them to sell all the in box free stuff separately in the next version
2024-03-29,God bless her. She is doing her best to convey the excitement.  This might be the hardest product to actually review.
2024-03-29,"Best moment… “when I’m having a bad day, I’ll just come over here to the Steve Jobs theater, and… give presentations”. Most relatable comment ever"
2024-03-29,I don't know if I'm so surprised because this Vision Pro works so freaking well or because Justine goes absolutely crazy with this
2024-03-29,Wow. So glad she actually showed us her using the Vision Pro
2024-03-29,"Looks inredible, hopefully they add more productivity features and a cheaper version so more people can use it for work!"
2024-03-29,Ijustine just called me poor in all languages!
2024-03-29,"No one can match your energy, Justine."
2024-03-29,"is this a apple-commercial?  not one single critical word (others had to say about that headset)
this here should be a review? its a apple-Commercial"
2024-03-29,Can’t wait for 3D animation softwares working with Apple Vision Pro… that will be awesome!
2024-03-29,"THIS IS INSANE , I DONT REMEMBER WHEN IS THE LAST TIME THAT A PRODUCT SURPASS EXPECTATION , PROBABLY EARLY 2000 TECH , THIS IS HUGE I CANT WAIT TO TRY IT BECAUSE ITS GONNA BE A DIFFERENT VIBE"
2024-03-29,i enjoyed this video more then marques’s video. this felt more hands on! nice video justine!
2024-03-29,The amount of creators that mentioned how the fricking polishing cloth is better than normal
2024-03-29,19:26 her reaction to her presentation actually showing up on the big screen
2024-03-29,Your enthusiasm and genuinely love for Apple products always makes me giddy with excitement!
2024-03-29,Gaming on it would be so awesome! Can’t wait to try baseball or FPS games.
2024-03-29,"Ready, Player One has come to life"
2024-05-03,"Justine, love your reviews!! The case is supposed to look like the space suits the astronauts wore when landing on the moon!!!!  Yeah I’m a bit old but I amazed no one has picked up on that!!"
2024-03-29,The DJing part had me DYING hahaha thank you so much Justine for your content <3
2024-07-02,@ijustine You have convinced me to get that amazing sorcery at it's finest
2024-03-29,What I like about iJustine is that she is not intimidating to watch. Her reactions are just so relatable and represent the average consumer. Majority of us don't care about chips and processors and whatnot but rather the whole experience and she gives us that glimpse!
2024-03-29,That facetime was uncanny valley
2024-03-29,I was wondering if iJustine opinion was of this and well here it is
2024-03-29,"Congratulations, iJustine on this video! I'm coming to your channel to watch your experience with APPLE VISION PRO, after Marques' video.
What to say, overall it's very cool experience with them and it's good that, you also showed us little demos. All in all, I understand your joy, as I am an Apple fan like you!

Greetings from Romania!"
2024-03-29,"Thanks iJ, VR being THIS advanced already in 2024 is beyond a marvel of engineering. What a time to be alive!!! Now to sell my house so I can afford one"
2024-03-29,"15 years ago we could only dream of something like this, so it's cool to see how far we've come. With that said, You can do a lot of this stuff with a pair of $500 AR Glasses or a Quest. Apple priced this device way too high. But I think their implementation seems better than other options. I'll be curious to see where this device and AR Glasses are in 4 or 5 years. We've come pretty far in just a few years since Google Tried to do this."
2024-03-29,i have to watch ijustine first before mkbhd because of how she unboxes apple products.
2024-03-29,"Watching Justine react to the miracle that technology can provide is amazing.  She has made me laugh, she has made me cry.  Genuine, and real.  100% my favorite YT creator.  We love ya."
2024-10-30,Thank you so much for showing off Keynote! Most reviewers don’t even show this. I did the demo in the Apple Store and the employee didn’t even know how to do it. I do presentations for work and this will be very useful for practicing.
2024-03-29,Can't wait to see where this product goes in the future!
2024-03-29,31:18 that mirror reflections and everything wow
2024-03-29,"This looks amazing. I can’t wait to try this out myself. 
It’s going to be amazing when this becomes more affordable for everybody. 
What a pivotal event for the future of tech"
2024-03-29,That DJ app for Vision Pro is actually cool
2024-03-29,She would buy Apple toilet paper at a premium and think it's the best experience...
2024-03-29,Mind blowing for the advancement of tech. Always expect top quality from you iJ! This was fantastic
2024-03-29,"It’s honestly crazy she’s made a decade long career shilling for apple. I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything but her apple product reviews get any attention for all this time.

I ain’t even mad about it, I just think it’s crazy you can make a career out of going “ooo apple cool” to everything they release. Tbh I feel like the idiot for making the wrong career choice."
2024-03-29,"One thng thst I don't like abut this is you have to have a iPhone or iPad to use the Apple Vision Pro. Some peole just want to stick with Android but maybe want to get this and use it standalone and you can't. I would love to have something like this wherte I could run my windows applications on this and edit using Vegas Pro, FL Studio, and other PC games like GTAV etc."
2024-03-29,I didn't think I wanted this... until I watched your video!!!!! You always make everything so relatable to my life.
2024-03-29,"This is how I think regular, non-tech-reviewer people will react when they use Vision Pro. This thing has so many features that are leaps and bounds better than Meta, HTC, or any other headset. Very exciting stuff!"
2024-03-29,The only people buying these right now are social media influencers. This is about five years away from actually being a productive device. I can see potential for construction and surgery
2024-03-29,Awesome job Justine with the tech review
2024-03-29,in a decade when they come out with the third gen vision pro i’ll FINALLY be able to afford the first gen
2024-03-29,Thank you for bringing the excitement and energy to this unboxing video!!!
2024-03-29,"Best “features” video that I’ve seen! Some reviewers are negative right off the top without even showing you the actual features of the device, and what the device does well. I appreciate you taking us inside to get a real idea of new user case scenarios. Thank you"
2024-03-29,"Love the FaceTime call feature, looks soo interesting and cool!"
2024-03-29,Almost everything she was excited about I have experience in a Quest 3 and it is so cool and so fun. Now that Apple has stepped in it's so cool seeing new people get excited about this kind of thing all over again!
2024-03-29,The future is  coming!
2024-03-29,My grand grandchild now knows that I witnessed this historical moment directly
2024-07-02,All that’s missing is the open mouth shocked face for the thumbnail.
2024-03-29,"Apart from the software limitations, the low FOV would bother me the most at this price. Perhaps interesting in version 3."
2024-03-29,"This is not a crticial review, it is just praising"
2024-03-29,"Unboxing with iJustine always brings good vibes, enhancing our excitement."
2024-03-29,Wow. That FaceTime call! Whoa! Like it captures facial expressions with the emotion they felt. Crazy!
2024-03-29,I find it funny that Justine is freaking out over features that are common or normal in other headsets.
2024-03-29,"I really hope Steve Jobs can see Ijustine from heaven now, her reactions are golden."
2024-03-29,"Why is everybody so excited?! except me, is that because I'm poor?"
2024-03-29,"Thank you iJustine for boiling this down to one video, I really enjoyed this experience!"
2024-03-29,I want one so bad haha. I feel like it would end up sitting in the box like my Meta Quest 2 though haha
2024-03-29,"this is the BEST unboxing, review and demo of vision pro! Thank you so much for going into so much detail and for being so excited too"
2024-03-29,the Facetime call is INSANE
2024-03-29,It always amazes me how Justine always gets excited about every little thing!  Girl calm down!
2024-03-29,"This is quite the advancement of tech in a slimish fashion, I love this channel for its coverage"
2024-03-29,"Every architecture studio should own this to present their vision to clients, there is no better way to see it. Weather it's inside or outside, vision pro could cover it perfectly"
2024-03-29,Best Apple Vision Pro review congrats!!!! Love your energy
2024-03-29,"I loved the concept Apple took all of you influencers and made one huge collaboration promotion video with great positive reviews. Topnotch promotional thinking, though it seems too obvious and transparent. I could suggest other strategies as well, like comparing it with other VR sets, and think out of the box of clean and straightforward reviews, that are too commercial in disguise. imho, A Challenge video will have a much larger effect on viewers, Like ""I tried living a full week with Apple Vision Pro attached to my head!"" Good luck, Apple wizards!"
2024-03-29,"I think they should stabilize the cameras more.
When you look around in real life, you don't get those small shakes"
2024-03-29,The future is arrived
2024-03-29,"Wow Justine, this technology is game changing. 
Light years ahead, congratulations apple on functionality & usability without lags"
2024-03-29,the best youtuber :D
2024-03-29,what happened with the main camera angle?
2024-03-29,She’s such a nerd  she muted hey siri
2024-03-29,You don't know how much i Love watching unboxing this premium product by you
2024-03-29,"So let me get this straight: the future is being isolated and alone inside a virtual illusion world that is over half a kilogramm front heavy, has half the colors, quarter the resolution if not less, half the angle of view and where my face looks like a uncanny valley android ? Is this THE future ? Holy crap  Imagine people fleeing from reality into this...."
2024-03-29,Soo beautiful so spatial! I can’t wait to get my Apple Vision Pro
2024-03-29,My favorite part of all these reviews is people wishing it came with stickers.
2024-03-29,Justine at mark 9:00…..” I CAN SEE! I CAN SEE! “   LOL
2024-03-29,I love this video because it focuses on showing how to experience vision pro as a normal user and not trying to highlight every flaw that already exists in it because it is so obvious there would be many flaws in a first gen product.
2024-03-29,"Just discovered your channel, and I am a fan! Best unboxing video yet!"
2024-03-29,I’m not a huge fan but I love Justine she’s is happy and fun to watch
2024-03-29,Your videos convinced me to get an iPhone years ago so thankyou so much and I still rewatch all your old unboxing videos so good
2024-03-29,"I really love how excited Justine gets about new tech, and other YouTubers in general. Makes me happy seeing people loving what they do."
2024-03-29,"This is not a review, this is straight just an Apple marketing."
2024-03-29,You're the best! You WILL be speaking in that theatre soon! I love how you were able to navigate the experience for your guest! too cool!
2024-03-29,paid for by Apple
2024-03-29,That was fantastic! Thanks Justine.
2024-03-29,“On the edge of uncanny valley” I’m sorry but it is 100% uncanny the avatars look creepy and unnatural
2024-03-29,"""spatial computing"" has been called AR and MR for years.  Augmented reality and mixed reality.  This is an over the top video from someone that has never experienced VR/AR/MR before.  Performative."
2024-03-29,"Nothing of value was shown in this video, such an amazing “tech reviewer”. And don’t forget the hoard of simps in the comments."
2024-03-29,"Yeah, I can see this becoming again the industry standard of the future of tech. Way to go, Apple"
2024-03-29,Jesus woman. Calm the hell down. It’s just a piece of plastic.
2024-03-29,Hey around 13:08 you might have accidentally forgotten to put the screen recording! but it was a good video!
2024-03-29,what is a point of this shit? 3500 for this shit? Who buy this is insane
2024-03-29,"OMG that is so freaking cool. Thank you Justine for the amazing video, I don’t think the other reviewers managed to showcase how amazing it is but just talk about the limitations. Thank you"
2024-03-29,Another bias review from iJustine yet again.
2024-03-29,How are you getting the video from inside seeing what you see? Doesn’t have screen record?
2024-03-29,This is why YouTube needs a spacial app. Live your video thank you
2024-03-29,So you pay almost $4000 to use a computer with goggles?
2024-03-29,Nobody is as credibly happy as I iJustine love it
2024-03-29,No Netflix No Youtube No spotify ..... No Thanks
2024-03-29,"Can't wait to hear the ''scratches at level 6, with deeper grooves at level 7''"
2024-03-29,
2024-03-29,look its Justine queuing over the apple vision pro as expected
2024-03-29,"Excellent video and I love that you showed the user experience. I want this headset even more now, but I can’t afford it"
2024-03-29,Thank you for always embodying the happiness I get when new Apple products come out
2024-03-29,I am swimming in the mountain! This is awesome Justine!
2024-03-29,"This is exciting, but I will wait until it’s sunglasses size and 2k less. Excited for you!"
2024-03-29,"This was an incredibly thorough video!!! And it’s soooooo cool. Thanks, Justine!!!"
2024-03-29,31:00 Imagine having to walk around your house to find virtual objects that you misplaced
2024-03-29,this is more than a hype than an actual honest review of the product.
2024-03-29,Now it's VR Justine - she will never ever put it down again.
2024-03-29,"In 2-3 years time, once they release cheaper version for general public with lighter weight and longer light battery, it will definitely change the world. Meta verse and NFT will be everything."
2024-03-29,"Apple did it again! Like Justine, you too can look like a housefly on steroids"
2024-03-29,"Very immersive and the personal assistant is getting better. Just talk to it and it is going to make your wishes come true. Instead of pointing to app and running it, just say that you want to appear in London."
2024-03-29,What you said around 11:50 kind of applies to any mixed reality rig. I had the exact same feeling with my quest 2
2024-03-29,The Apple Vision Pro is just too cool for words.
2024-03-29,"IT's INSANNEEEEEEEE OMGGGGGG
thx jusrtine for this unboxingggg"
2024-03-29,"I think we must all start to appreciate these impressive innovations coming during our lifetime… whoever thought a day will come where we will type in the air? I’m grateful to be alive today….

May we live long enough to see Apple taking off the charging brick saying we don’t need it.."
2024-03-29,"Future is blast
Thank u tech giant apple for bring the upcoming future."
2024-03-29,I love that Armando is filming roll for this video.
2024-03-29,waiting for the rest of the scuba diving gear :D
2024-03-29,Looks great! I want one but can't justify buying one right now.
2024-03-29,"The tech looks absolutely insane, but there's no way to justify owning one at this point. Can't wait to try at an Apple Store though!"
2024-03-29,Amazing video.  Great production.
2024-03-29,"Bro called me poor in 2,153 different languages"
2024-03-29,"Can you maybe try to leave a serious review once in a while, instead of having a fangirl moment for every new product that Apple launches?"
2024-03-29,"This is so smooth unboxing, mkbhd was so rough with everything"
2024-03-29,woah the facetime demo is like seeing a PS2 graphic of a AAA game back then
2024-03-29,You are adorable and your enthusiasm is affecting.    As with new toys there is always that excitement.  It would be great to see a follow up video on how you use it day to day etc.  and whether  it is useful or if you get things done better etc.   meaning how it changes /improves/negatively impact your day to day life like how an iPhone would change ours even though we are no longer gaga over a new release.
2024-03-29,The ASMR videos are going to be freaking WILD!!!
2024-03-29,"Justine you test everything so good smartphones,tvs and other  stuff"
2024-03-29,"Justine! I think it was one of the best reviews I’ve seen, but no ones explained how do you guys share screen with us. Is it video recording? Or is it possible for me to show people around me what I am seeing via airplay or something?"
2024-03-29,It will be cool to come back to this video in four years' time to see just how far the technology and use cases for Vision Pro has developed!
2024-03-29,I am probably going to wait for the 2nd or 3rd version of this thing but the fact that I can put as many digital screens in any size anywhere I want is a huge deal. I‘m multitasking with 5-6 desktops on the Mac so I have to switch them all the time between 2 screens. This is going to make a huge difference in terms of workflow
2024-03-29,This one going banger with apple ecosystem....peoples with most apple products will probably buy this one.
2024-03-29,"""Choo Choo Mountain is on my neck.""

Most profound review of Vision Pro yet."
2024-03-29,"After watching days of reviews, a genius idea just came to me - a knit cap for your head that looks just like the Vision Pro front lens cover, perhaps the inside is lined with material similar to the strap. You are also the only reviewer to mention using that case as a pillow, which I wondered about the first review I saw it in...  and you are teh only reviewer to carefully snip your ""Hey Siri"" not to trigger viewers devices. Thanks for the great review!"
2024-03-29,Great review Justine! Nice to see so many examples of the UI and use-cases
2024-03-29,"Guys, I think she recorded this at 3:30 AM since her iPhone was in Sleep focus with an Alarm set for 6 AM, the dedication is UNREAL Justine"
2024-03-29,grown ass women sat alone at home with a headset on. This is the future?
2024-03-29,I’d think the voice control is going to be the best way to get text in there. I use Voice Control on my Apple devices all the time.
2024-03-29,Can't wait until I can use this for Adobe Illustrator and PS
2024-03-29,"Going to the Apple store Friday to pick mine up, So excited!  But I'm scared it won't work due to my vision issues, waiting for Zeiss to review my prescription should find out today.  Fingers crossed ... not eyes :)"
2024-03-29,"to keep costs at an affordable, consumer friendly, low, low price of $3500USD apple had to make some sacrifices.  The stickers for one..."
2024-03-29,I knew where I had to come when I knew the reviews were out.
2024-03-29,That was so fun. I can't wait until I can afford one.... maybe in a couple years or so... I hope the spatial video gets even better too... I think that would be amazing.
2024-03-29,The pillowy case reminds me of the O2 tanks from the 80’s movie Space Camp
2024-03-29,This is the Future!!!! Buy all the Apple stock you can afford because this is many times bigger than the iPhone!!  Bravo Apple!!
2024-03-29,best review video I've seen by far! thank you! please make more like this :)
2024-03-29,"when you went into the editing portion with the Mac, I literally out loud, just said “hell yeah”"
2024-03-29,The travel case looks like an astronaut suit! Looks awesome 6:10
2024-03-29,"This has been one of the best demos I’ve seen, thank you ijustine"
2024-03-29,"I've been excited about the Apple Vision Pro since they announced it, but after seeing your video I'm soo sooo hyped.  Your reaction was so heartwarming and wholesome and I smiled throughout the whole video.  Can’t wait to see what people will do with it and to try it out myself"
2024-03-29,As along time VR user I'm genuinely impressed with how smooth and intuitive they've made the ui but I do think that could be a limiting factor for future software and features. As impressive as it is it's nothing that couldn't be mostly acheived on cheaper hardware and price will be this device's biggest limitaion to adoption rate... it will proably inadvertaintly boost Quest 3 sales a little tbh
2024-03-29,I just demo this today wow im goin to buy i need this this is forsure revolutionary
2024-03-29,love your excitement!!
2024-03-29,Honestly I might buy it so I can come home from work smoke a blunt and throw these on and just relax
2024-03-29,People like this lady is the reason companies can sell stuff so much more expensive then there worth
2024-03-29,Some of the eye fatigue is due to the fixed focal depth. Outside a headset you change your focus as you look at things of different distances; but in HMDs everything has the same focal distance.
2024-03-29,What a time to be alive
2024-03-29,I like that you're having fun with it. A lot of other reviewers just come off as jaded.
2024-03-29,"This by far is so cool freaking awesome man,!!! U have virtual phones now goodness graciouss!!!!"
2024-03-29,"Ahah, love you Justine!! Thanks for this incredible demo!! Looks incredible!"
2024-03-29,Very good demonstration of what's inside. I would have liked to see some of the common concerns like weight and headset limitations addressed.
2024-03-29,"I loved this omg, your videos are just so amazing always"
2024-03-29,It’s dope obviously still needs alot growth
2024-03-29,"Apple, love it or hate it, this is incredible. Start of a new journey"
2024-03-29,Can’t wait to watch For All Mankind on the lunar surface with Apple Vision Pro
2024-03-29,"She loved her persona, makes her look 20 years younger."
2024-03-29,This is the future
2024-03-29,wow its great to see your reaction in real time omg
2024-03-29,"This is probably one of the coolest techs I have seen from Apple. I know I'll probably never be able to afford it, but god damn I want one so much now. ; _ ;"
2024-03-29,Looking through the screens to your environment is almost like a visual version of the AirPods Pro transparency mode. Most of the time you notice the screen but good enough to forget I’m wearing earphones sometimes if I’m focused. Will get used to it more in the future probably.
2024-07-02,It’s amazing the cloth smells new and fresh considering it is.
2024-03-29,Best vision pro video by far. Well done!!
2024-03-29,"I was blown away by the Oculus Quest 2 that I purchased almost three years ago, but the Vision Pro is miles ahead from that!"
2024-03-29,The 3d effect  of dinausore . That is under rated . This will be a good feature
2024-03-29,Wow that’s awesome
2024-03-29,"All the quest 3 users feeling gaslit lol. Of course the Vision Pro has vastly superior hardware and I can't wait to buy one when the price comes down, but acting like Apple invented VR? I mean come on."
2024-07-02,Do u gave to pay extra for the dual loop band and everything u just unboxed or is it does it come standard
2024-03-29,Its Just Incredible
2024-03-29,"I love your good energy ! tks for these, and all the other before as well :)"
2024-03-29,award for most dramatic reviewer lmao
2024-03-29,this woman is the most blatant apple shill in existence
2024-03-29,iJustine=overreacting …so much
2024-03-29,"Dear Apple, I cant wait for the rest of the scuba gear!"
2024-05-03,"Happy tears in my eyes for your joy and excitement !!🥹 The ability to leave screens in various rooms is soooo freakin cool️ It’s Beautiful and Pricey, It’s Apple !! Thank you so much for everything!!"
2024-03-29,"This thing is freaking insane. It changes the way people enjoy online content and work!
A curiosity, what happens if you open multiple windows in different rooms?
As always amazing video"
2024-03-29,Apple Vision Pro is literally the dream of everything technology has to offer. Like sometimes I do invincible typing with my hands. ️🫠
2024-03-29,I want a super cut of ‘My Hands!!’
2024-03-29,No Third party Imemrsive experience allowed. You can't even watch 360 Stereo Videos. it just shown as side by side
2024-03-29,Super cool. Am curious on using The Apple Watch with the Vision Pro on like seeing the watch on the Vision Pro and if it affects anything when using the Vision Pro?
2024-03-29,I loved that we could see your POV when using the Vision Pro! Can’t wait to try it out myself
2024-03-29,Excellent video!  LOL when Justine was chair dancing
2024-03-29,Incredible video! This thing is going to be revolutionary.
2024-03-29,"""I feel like a god"" this is exactly what it is all about!"
2024-03-29,Looks totally amazing!
2024-03-29,Persona was really awesome!   Apple just killed it.  You all looked like you.
2024-03-29,I have the exact feeling from Vison pro as it was with first iPhone. A mixture of excitement  from defenitely a breakthrough piece of gear and a pinch of disappointment from aspects.
2024-03-29,Wow it looks so mind-blowing looks awesome.
2024-07-02,"Finally received the Apple Vision Pro! 

Hi everyone! I asked a friend who was returning from the United States to buy me a Apple VIsion Pro and I received it 2 days ago! I’m really enjoying using it!! The App Store not working in India is not all a hindrance! 

Also i can watch already purchased movies on  the Apple TV app..

Interacting with the user interface is very simple… amazed at how Apple made it possible and ditched physical controls.

Also I am enjoying taking spatial videos! 

And when I want to zone out of my environment I just rotate the crown to view my favourite environment!"
2024-03-29,hmmm a woman named her channel iJustine sure she will do the most honest review ever right
2024-03-29,I love thw dj part so cute i love your dancing i was having fun too
2024-03-29,The FaceTime was hilarious. But all jokes aside this is an amazing piece of technology.
2024-03-29,Looks nice but I’ll wait for vision pro MAX
2024-10-30,i get it when some people have said its way better than having a meta quest 3 but at the price that they are charging and the fact that you cant just use it as as stand alone device you need an iphone macbook or ipa to set it up makes it even more exspensive
2024-03-29,Nice video iJ!
2024-03-29,"Great introduction to the Vision Pro, thanks! I am very excited about the possibilities of this opens up for gaming..."
2024-03-29,Great review.  Very entertaining
2024-03-29,Omg omg omg I said it here first I’ve always dreamt of a harry potter game with this can u imagine the wand movement and limitless possibilities Tim cook really cooked and knew what he was doing
2024-03-29,Superb unboxing and review.  Subbed
2024-03-29,"I don’t care about the item itself, I just care I’m watching a unboxing video"
2024-03-29,The DJ app was the best because it utilised the spatial aspect. Loved the demo overall.
2024-03-29,"I'm a little bit heart-broken....   That video editing experience was lackluster.   That interface should have been mnd-blowing.  You main screen should be a theater.  You timeline should be big, touchable, and right in front-of you.  Your entire field of view should have transformed into a freakin control center for video editing.  Instead it was the iPad app in a floating window?!?

They dropped the ball on that one."
2024-08-31,Yay! I love this music
2024-03-29,I can't wait to See it Through when i get one.
2024-03-29,Awesome Video!!!!  I pick my Apple Vision Pro up tomorow!
2024-03-29,I'm trying to figure out how this wouldn't rub my makeup off
2024-03-29,I was born in 1996 and I always grew up with technology evolving. I think this is the point where I will get left behind
2024-03-29,Thank you iJustine! This really gives me an idea of what it’s like to have the Vision Pro. :)
2024-03-29,I would love to own one of these unfortunately since I can not see because I’m totally blind it would have no use for me but I can only imagine the endless possibilities with people with vision with these glasses. Although I do wonder what kind of accessibility would they have in the future for navigational purposes with people with visual impairment.
2024-03-29,thank you so much. Really good walkthrough of the Vision Pro. I can't wait to try it on
2024-03-29,That was great
2024-03-29,Great job covering everything by the way. Even though I feel a little woozy now.
2024-03-29,Thank you for this video. Truly amazing job conveying the experience to us
2024-03-29,"Wow! It was so fu*kin crazy thing that I have ever seen
Thanks Justine for this amazing video️"
2024-03-29,The Dj segment just made me think what it would look like once they put Final cut and logic pro on there
2024-03-29,The best video ive seen on this product youre the best to do it GOOD STUFF
2024-03-29,I dunno.. it look sinteresting but as a long time VR user the things Justine goes bananas about are kindof my bread and butter now.. lol.
2024-03-29,"Ngl Apple has perfectly executed the concept of spatial computing with it’s Marvelous Vision Pro it’s superb and its integration to real life is mind blowing 
And in the whole video @iJustine did a great job doing by showcasing how Vision Pro works and feels when you experience it tbh she really deserves to give presentation at Steve Jobs Theater ..  her reaction when she was presented virtually at stage , she truly rocked while reviewing Vision Pro nothing but Respect to one of the most beautiful, best & brilliant tech YouTuber 🫡
My doubt is we will be prone to get eye fatigue using it for for more 1 hour idk about but it’s just my speculation what are your thoughts on this Justine ?"
2024-03-29,On one hand I'm always weary of how she never sees anything wrong in an apple product and on the other hand I'm glad she's so enthused by this product despite the many concerns
2024-03-29,It's quite strange you did not do the review for samsung s24 ultra .Is apple so much priority
2024-03-29,Great that you brought others into the experience. Thank you for the awesome experience!
2024-03-29,I like this review of the Apple Vision Pro by iVocalFry Pro Max
2024-03-29,"Thank you for such a lovely video! I had been waiting for the videos about Vision Pro, (obviously, that's because I can't afford it and I'm not even in US), so this video was very helpful to feel what it is like unboxing and trying the headset! I can't wait for them to ship one of those to Japan someday!"
2024-03-29,THIS IS SO COOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2024-03-29,"last time I was this excited about a new gadget was with the first iPhone, I was still in college, so I got a job and started saving for my first iPhone, I was able to buy the first 3G version"
2024-03-29,8:58 Thank you for the reenactment of a blind person being cured by Jesus
2024-03-29,"idk the last time a product surpassed my expectation, usually first gen products are okayishh!! but this thingg like dude i neeed thiss so bad!!"
2024-03-29,The excitement with the laser pointer
2024-03-29,"Thanks for sharing your personal experience with this amazing technology! The big question is whether the headset can be worn for extended periods of time for daily productivity. My personal experience with other VR's is that wearing it for more than an hour at a time is extremely uncomfortable and causes great discomfort with the head, neck, and face. I still don't see how it could replace multiple large monitors and a traditional keyboard and mouse for speed and efficiency. There is no way you could edit movies faster with finger gestures than instant clicks on a mouse and keyboard!"
2024-03-29,This video was a breath of fresh after the negative Verge review
2024-03-29,Wow so impressive video good job Justine Vision Pro look so cool
2024-03-29,I had to come here first for the best first unboxing
2024-03-29,Don’t comment on YouTube videos but for this one I will.  Really enjoyed your presentation and how thorough you were.  Great job.  Too expensive for me and my needs but a really nice device.
2024-03-29,"I'm waiting for Apple Vision Pro 5 to come out, so I can buy this version  Hello from Croatia"
2024-03-29,"C'MON!!! I WANT THIS NOW!!! The DJ App is for me!!  Thank you for this video, its excellent!!"
2024-03-29,"Always love your reviews 

I want one!"
2024-03-29,Loved it! Good job! Thank you Justine!!!
2024-03-29,This is really impressive
2024-03-29,This is a really great video on showing what this product is about. Great job. I hated this thing but after watching. I MUST have one. But I have to wait till the price drops unfortunately because it’s quite expensive.
2024-03-29,I really enjoy your enthusiasm :D Made my day
2024-03-29,"Hey Justine, it'd be awesome if you shared your thoughts on how lossless audio sounds between Airpods Pro 2 USB- C and Apple Vision Pro. I am really curious to hear your thoughts."
2024-03-29,Now this is just impressive
2024-03-29,I don’t know why I’m watching this it’s going to make me buy it
2024-03-29,Can’t wait for the 5th generation of these
2024-03-29,Just ordered one.  Thanks Justine!
2024-03-29,It looked so good.
2024-03-29,The way you type on finger to vision pro is how I type normally  I never followed the proper hand positions
2024-03-29,bro that facetime is sooo scary
2024-03-29,"Amazing!! No worries on the length of the video, I want to see more! I need to win the lotto and get one of these!"
2024-03-29,"Airpod Max : Oh...welcome, vision pro. I have been so lonely since I was released. Now I have a friend like me."
2024-03-29,Great video. Thanks for the hands on.
2024-03-29,Thank you for this video. I would like to see more Apple Arcade videos if possible with the vision
2024-03-29,"If this is what we’re getting with their first attempt, I’m so excited for the future of these."
2024-03-29,Love the MacOS X Galaxy background in the thumbnail
2024-03-29,Can’t believe that Apple includes a lot of accessories for users these days
2024-03-29,In my mind : I justine look like a Tim cook
2024-03-29,Need one now
2024-03-29,I wonder why Brian’s avatar looked the most accurate to how he looks compared to iJustine and MKBHD?? Seems like a dope experience tbh. I just think it’s a very niche product.
2024-03-29,"By the way (it may sound funny), I am your youngest Turkish follower. Because you are the only one in the U.S. who promotes Apple products properly. I can tell you my age if you ask."
2024-03-29,"What would convince me to buy one is if Apple designed a physical form for Siri to act like a hologram personal assistant that shows up when you talk to her, like Cortana."
2024-03-29,"Justine's avatar looks like reincarnation of Jesus Christ, I just can't"
2024-03-29,"Maby I'll buy vision pro in the future, just because of it's cute bag"
2024-03-29,This is my new fav video on the web
2024-03-29,This is absolutely beautiful. I’m definitely gonna get one but I’m trying to figure out what could be the use case of it?
2024-03-29,I AM JUST LOOOVVINGGGG THIS....!!! APPLE VISION PRO IS JUST SO COOL AND AMAZINNNGGGGG!!
2024-03-29,I just realized you were on a episode of The Vampire Diaries omg!!!
2024-03-29,Love your energy
2024-03-29,one video - 3 reviews & 3 reviewers... expecting more crossovers like this..
2024-03-29,"We need more of it. Follow up video Please Justine. ️
And also I love you I love your videos you are the Best."
2024-03-29,"It's a funny moment when you pretend to ""see"" through it for the first time! (since you had it on at the apple event and a few weeks ago)  But I like the emotion!"
2024-03-29,When we can walk about in these is when I’ll invest in one
2024-03-29,This is revolutionary
2024-03-29,"Looks amazing, doesn't it come with all the cellophane cover to protect everything ? Looks stunning  I have CV1 from 2016"
2024-03-29,Age comes for us all. I saw her on MK and had to see her on here.
2024-03-29,Nice device that surfs off of the development of other companies. I am waiting to see how many software developers will support it... besides Apple. I do see a breakage issue with the front custom glass.
2024-03-29,so amazing and wonderful video it is comprehensive video for this product and you are so beautiful and charming as I told you before you are really Apple Icon you are captivates the heart by your face  your voice and your expression method congratulations babe for this new product  and don't care about negative comments
2024-03-29,I would say Apple glasses woulld be much more cooll..wait for it
2024-03-29,Seems cool but I wish the MacBook experience could give a second display. I love using my MacBook on my lap and would love a secondary large display behind it for my FCP viewer window.
2024-03-29,"I thought Justine was going to pass out she was so excited! And she's usually always excited for Apple products. I'm actually afraid to go test this out at the Apple store because then I'm going to attempt to justify spending $3,500!"
2024-03-29,I’m so happy you’re healthy again miss
2024-03-29,Thank you for showing this.  I would love to be able to purchase the Vision Pro but alas out of my price range.  Hopefully Apple will have a more affordable one in the future.
2024-03-29,This was like watching a 10 year old with it
2024-03-29,"hahahaha a Bra, Justine is so real for this, luv the content."
2024-03-29,Are the Personas in FaceTime shown to Vision Pro users as 3D with depth against a background or flat?
2024-03-29,The Apple Vision E-Waste. Plastic / scratches at level 2 with deeper grooves at level 3
2024-03-29,This is why I think Vision Pro is for business people and not the everyday consumer especially with the price tag of 4k pretty much when you buy the extra accessories.
2024-03-29,Judging by allot thr things which gets iJustine excited? Her using the Vision Pro is probably how humans can actually have sex with technology.
2024-03-29,"Hey iJustine 
Thanks for the video.. Awesome job 
Does anyone know how much interactions can have 2 dudes or chicks when both wearing their own VisionPro ?
Can they watch the same movie??? Etc..
If yes I buy 2 of them … lol (would just be happy to have 1… some day)"
2024-03-29,"When I first tried VR with the Quest 2, I kept experiencing the urge to teleport or thumbstick forward after taking the headset off and just being in real life. That went away after about a week haha. This looks pretty great but Quest 3 is good enough for $500. Looking forward to the next gen. Oh but I love how clean that hand occlusion is on the Apple Vision Pro."
2024-03-29,The Steve Jobs Theatre? That's so cool!
2024-03-29,iJustine doesnt have a youtube premium account :P 17:07
2024-03-29,Just think how 150 years ago movies didnt even exist yet and now we have these. Wow
2024-03-29,"Old days- “don’t sit so close to TV. It may damage your eyes”

Today- let’s fit a TV on face."
2024-03-29,Lots of incredible things about this
2024-03-29,Steve would’ve gotten a kick out of this. The future is here folks.
2024-03-29,"Look at her smile ,it's like"
2024-03-29,The actual use of this vision pro is in the workspace along side macbooks and opening multiple tabs and in the Apple ecosystem
2024-03-29,This is a must buy
2024-03-29,"its such a bummer that Johnny Ive couldn't introduce this product. its missing that special feel and introduction. I would be in much more ""awe"" if he narrated and introduced it. He has a way of truly connecting the company to the product while offering it to the consumer in an effortless union."
2024-03-29,I love how they managed to put in this battery case 1\3 or a battery that should fit in... guess what is going to be the next optional accessory for $1000 more :) new battery with 2\3 so around 6000mah.
2024-03-29,When does the rest of the scubba gear come out?
2024-03-29,Amazing video!
2024-03-29,MKBHD showing at every vision pro review I had watched
2024-03-29,I'm hoping there's a lot more to come since SO FAR everything that has been demoed is just a combination of very good pass through of the environment and subpar VR compared to what is already out there...
2024-03-29,Hoth Rebel vibes. I want an orange jumpsuit and jetpack next gen
2024-03-29,"Excellent video, informative, and exciting to see your reactions to the VisionPro, Justine. QQ. How did you capture the VisionPro video? That was very cool. Waiting for mine to get here on Friday to play with it and experience the VisionPro by myself."
2024-03-29,Thank you very much for the exciting video. I really hope that I will soon be able to buy the Apple Vision Pro in Germany.
2024-03-29,Amazing!!! Video…  thank you so much!!!
2024-03-29,"This is the future. Again , apple has reinvented virtual reality"
2024-03-29,That’s crazy omg! I can’t wait to buy it.
2024-03-29,Great review.
2024-03-29,An advice from a 10 years Apple fan: always buy the second or later generation of an Apple product
2024-03-29,I'm SO JEALOUS because I'm in Canada. We don't have VisionOS
2024-03-29,this is insanely cool
2024-03-29,Never going to buy it but good to see how cool it is tho!
2024-03-29,ok yall after using the 300$ quest 2 I can't say I find this any more impressive
2024-03-29,I really would like to buy one ️
2024-03-29,Full on Mufasa & Simba Moment!
2024-03-29,"That's so cool! Knowing Apple usually has great accessibility features, I wonder if it would still be usable by someone who might be blind, or might not be able to use their hands (to pinch/click)"
2024-03-29,"It's more of a toy than a helpful tool. As on the iPhone, the AR is not precise, the sensors do not recognize objects, hands and edges correctly. The cameras are bad, especially in dark rooms. VisionOS could still be improved and there are no useful apps. Unfortunately, it is not useful in the current state. Hopefully something will change in the next few years, but I think it will be like the Apple Pippin....."
2024-03-29,this could be a great alternative for a 4K/8K TV
2024-03-29,Justin: i am swimming in the mountains
2024-03-29,I would love to have one of this just to watch movies!
2024-03-29,seems like it has a lot of kinks. super excited to see the competition!
2024-03-29,15:53 he is like screaming cowboy meme
2024-03-29,"This is absolutely revolutionary, a product that can revolutionize the world, I wish Steve Jobs was here, to see that."
2024-03-29,Ok she is really paid by Apple  Nearly no critics about this product..This is not a review this is a small Test by a fanboy! More than 3500! Quest 3 also makes use of spatial Videos…
2024-03-29,"I really enjoyed this video. I think Vision Pro is awesome.  My problem is that these will never be affordable for just the average person, and by the time the price comes down these will be old tech. I understand the tech that is involved but could be cheaper"
2024-03-29,"Like, it's expensive and clunky, but I can see how awesome this will be when it's the size of a pair of Tony Stark shades."
2024-03-29,Its all fun and games until ya wanna masterb8 and you become fully aware you have a computer on your face thats tracking your hands ALL THE TIME :O
2024-03-29,That travel case looks something from NASA
2024-03-29,"iJustine listen to me, do you really want a computer that is always looking to your hands ?"
2024-03-29,NOT manifesting lmaoooo  loved that part
2024-03-29,26:10 your dog is sooo cute
2024-03-29,"Meta quest just got meta axed. Apple Vision Pro is mesmerizing, beautiful, and an illusion"
2024-03-29,"Glad I haven't purchased one yet, it's cool but I don't see myself or anyone using it for doing some serious work, but more for media consumption...Can't wait to see how it evolves in the coming years!"
2024-03-29,"i love that she mutes the “hey siri” cuz she knows it’s gonna make like 100,000 phones go off"
2024-03-29,Okay this is crazy right here
2024-03-29,Great video!!
2024-03-29,"Yeah, an Apple watch for your head!. Your expression is just like a 4 year old girl opening a Christmas present. Great unboxing and walk thru."
2024-03-29,"I can’t wait for them to finish the scuba diving gear in the next decade! But really, because it looks cool but I know there’s probably 50 different things sold separately for no reason"
2024-03-29,Looking forward to the affordable version.
2024-03-29,21:15 OMG thats is the map app I was imagining what apple could deliver with their map app with the 3d sky view and street view in the US as well as other available regions. honestly looking forward to that U_U
2024-03-29,oh my gosh!!  is INSANE!!!
2024-03-29,i liked the Steve Jobs theater part lol
2024-03-29,Wow! This is so amazing!
2024-03-29,"Wow, that is something extraordinary, well I must say Samsung would be working to bring a copy of this"
2024-03-29,iJustine videos are apple ads to be honest. Still watch them though.
2024-03-29,I'm in search of the perfect gear for my upcoming winter skiing adventure. Any recommendations?
2024-03-29,"I just skipped around the video, and heard her say ""I'll get used to the eye fatigue"""
2024-03-29,Ame las visión ella único producto de Apple que me encanta
2024-03-29,"Omg I love this! Also great video as always!  I’m just thinking, how would i use this on a daily basis, i feel like it would be too overwhelming to be in it everyday even if i wear it for like 2 hours! Thoughts?"
2024-03-29,"Currently, I feel I am doing spatial computing with a Model-T Ford.  I have a MacBook Pro MAX and two 34"" LCD displays.  I can't take them with me to the living room or to my library as they need to remain at my desk.  I can't bring them on a plane or train.  Using a touch pad or mouse, it's so slow and awkward to move my mouse between the limited 3 physical screens.  I still have to open and close or resize windows too frequently in order to share the limited displays.   It's time to release my bondage to the past.  I'm getting my future looking spatial computer on Friday ... an Apple Vision Pro !!!   (Oh ... by the way, it also has VR/AR entertainment possibilities, but that is only icing on the cake of having a real spatial computer)

I hope the above statement can help differential what a Spatial Computer is and why Vision Pro has a use case well beyond other limited VR/AR headsets."
2024-03-29,i dont want it to be used like a phone i just want vr headsets to be a gaming console i hope they develop more games for vr headset. one vr game that i like is echo vr it looks so cool and immersive like a real vr e-sport.
2024-03-29,Imagine if we had the Vision Pro during COVID
2024-03-29,Looks amazing!!! I want one so bad right now. The only problem is that price tag
2024-03-29,I’d love to see how well it can generate files for 3D CAD apps
2024-03-29,"I have a Quest 3 and it does way more what I need than the Vision Pro does and at 1/7th the cost. Maybe in 5-6 years when the Vision Pro has the library of games that Quest does and it's below $1500, only then will I think about getting one."
2024-03-29,Every time a new apple product comes out I'm running to iJustine's channel!
2024-03-29,This review is exactly what I thought it was going to be lol pretty cool tho
2024-03-29,"I heard if you look at a Gen 1 iPod classic through these, the Steve Jobs hologram/Persona appears in front of you with a special message. I think you need to have a screen lock on the iPod with the code '1984' to unlock it."
2024-03-29,Woahhh there’s lot of stuffs in this device
2024-03-29,so good!!! Lucky you
2024-03-29,I can already see the increase of eye disabilities in the future by just solely using this
2024-03-29,Thanks for censoring the “Hey Siri”
2024-03-29,It feels like I’m watching an episode of black mirror lol  like the first day they got implanted haha’ can’t wait when we won’t need to wear the glass and will just show up in your brain  but that will take a while… first step to it
2024-03-29,"Where does the sounds come from? I see you are wearing AirPods, do you need to wear them or are there speakers?"
2024-03-29,I admit it looks cool
2024-03-29,It really is like the glasses from Back To The Future 2
2024-03-29,I’m sorry but I couldn’t take this girl seriously at all.. MKBHD is the one. Even though she has some great visuals to show us
2024-03-29,I want one!
2024-03-29,"The headset looks better in person (1) because of video compression. But (2) and more importantly because it’s doing divested rendering to save on performance cost. Foveation means they focus rendering resources on the area where you are looking which correlates to the part of the screen that a portion of your retina called the fovea is looking. This is the port of your retina with good high light color vision and acuity and it’s very densely packed with photoreceptor cells each of which is better represented inside of the brain itself. The rest of the retina is low acuity, performs better in low light, reacts more responsively to fast motion, has poor color reception, and is less well represented inside the of the brain. Because your vision in those areas sucks the part of the image that hits those doesn’t have to be very high quality like the part that hits your fovea."
2024-03-29,"OMG, so crazy inovation and technolgy apple"
2024-03-29,the zeiss lenses as so well thought of !!
2024-03-29,"Justine, could you do a comparison between The Nreal Glasses and The Apple Vision Pro please?"
2024-03-29,still a baddie 10 years later
2024-03-29,It’s like holding a piece of the future
2024-03-29,"wait so… if someone comes over and u wanna show them, u cant? it needs to be you? that kinda sucks lol"
2024-03-29,"Impressive technology but I still can’t see a practical use. However, you can’t get to the size of glasses until you produce these. Can’t wait to see what this technology looks like in 3-5 years."
2024-03-29,"Yall need to chill. Everyone has a different level of excitement when they open something new. 

We don’t have to cater it to what you expect, or how you react to things for the first time lol 

This is completely new. And jts technology with polished software (compared to what’s currently on the market that is) 

30 years down the road. We are gonna look at this video and say.. look how horrible. Heavy. And bulky this goggle looks. But how ahead of its time it was back then. 

It’s a gen1 

Apples showing what the future has in store. And what the next level of interaction and productivity we can experience. Without having to go to a computer screen. 

Yeah it’s kinda mind blowing. But… we are heading there"
2024-03-29,I can’t stand VR headsets but this looks like something I could get behind…..when the price comes down. Cut to 10 years from now and we’re all wearing them instead of having an iPhone
2024-03-29,This video is better than marquez’s new release
2024-03-29,I think for the next update they can add frames to every window (from minimalist to classic). It kinda irks me the way they show the windows' edges right now.
2024-03-29,The one thing I wanna ask is my husband and I wanna get some ourselves and looooveee to watch movies. Can we share a movie in that experience as far as like what if we watched Jurassic Park in the woods? lol Like would we BOTH see the woods or just the one who set it up?
2024-03-29,Amazing
2024-03-29,Hi Justine! Did you edit this video with the Vision Pro?
2024-03-29,"It reminded of the air display from Megaman StarForce but instead of using EM Waves to display it in the air, it uses goggles. A few steps away from totally goggle-less. Technology is really advancing quite fast"
2024-03-29,Minute 25...OmG i can see a monitor infront of my face..Unbelievable
2024-03-29,"""This is amazing, I have safari open"" how amazingly low our standards go when we want to try and sell something."
2024-03-29,"By wearing an Apple Vision Pro, she will be one of the tamers (people who like Digimon)."
2024-03-29,Now if she did this demo sitting in her chair with headrest the way I would use it would make more sense. Having support for your head with the extra weight of the headset is probably better for ergonomics. For me this would be mainly at home use so I can have a huge monitor without having a huge monitor on the desk.
2024-03-29,Brrrrrrh let me guess next is Apple Vision Pro 2
2024-03-29,"If you’re watching a movie with other Apple ecosystem friends using FaceTime and SharePlay, what does the format look like? Will you all be in different seats in a theater or will there be no venue at all? Where will FaceTime windows appear, and will they be movable or locked?When someone uses hand gestures, like the heart shape, will the  animations be in 3D for the Vision Pro user?"
2024-03-29,shout out to the factory worker who worked on the product
2024-03-29,Spacial Computing with their Spacial Audio  I see what you did there Apple.
2024-03-29,This is BONKERS!!! So cool!! And it's only going to get better...
2024-03-29,SAO on this gonna go crazy
2024-03-29,Thank you so much dear Justine
2024-03-29,"I ACTUALLY WANT PIZZA, THANK YOU BYE!"
2024-03-29,Apple Fan Girl
2024-03-29,including me those who can't afford this are crying in the corner
2024-03-29,This is next level witchcraft magic and I am loving it. I can’t wait for mine to arrive 02/27/2024. 2024 is the beginning of wonderful tech.
2024-03-29,OMG! I want one bad now!!!
2024-03-29,OMGGGG THE QUEEN OF APPLE QUEEN OF STAN TWITTER IS HERE WITH THE VISION PRO
2024-03-29,25:48 I was like omg shut up justin lol
2024-03-29,"That’s awesome 
I think this is new world 
Apple is the best 
I can’t believe that"
2024-03-29,“You only have to do this once” PUHlease I wish I had the money to afford this thing
2024-03-29,Now people can sit and stare into Goggles instead of staring into a phone. Evolution has stopped
2024-03-29,Can you comment on the field of view - - FOV. I've heard it isnt even easy wide as the meta quest 3. Definitely seems like a huge down side if the FOV is low
2024-03-29,Will the Apple Vision Pro have cases available for it? That glass up front looks fragile…
2024-03-29,10:11  Brian Tong was the most natural-looking out of the three.
2024-03-29,and wow did you saw both vedios of meeting  the iphone12 mini and 13? i know 12 is old one but i just want to share i like watch those vedios before all :)
2024-03-29,Great video
2024-03-29,"I told my mom “mom, I just hope you know that by the end of this video I will have purchased a Vision Pro with your credit card"
2024-03-29,I really want to try one and see the celerity of it. I don't think ill get one and ill wait for more to happen first but I'm interested for sure.
2024-03-29,"This thing cost $3500 base, and it probably cost Apple less than $500 to make"
2024-03-29,One could call it a sock for the screen too though
2024-03-29,"I would love to get one but I have one concern. I know you need a device with Face ID when ordering but do you need an iPhone or iPad to setup & use the device? The only Apple device I currently have is a MacBook, I only recently got a new phone so I wouldn't be buying an iPhone any time soon & i dont really have any use for an iPad"
2024-03-29,"Aaahmmm 
A power Bank?!?! Really?!?!"
2024-03-29,For $4000 they couldn’t have given us the travel case with it? What a greedy company smh
2024-03-29,"I just watched my first iJustine YouTube Video and Subscribed, my daughter told me a long time ago to, but I never got around to it, sorry. Petty Cool Rig and want to try it for so many reasons, Gaming, Movies, checking out things I could never do in real life, such as flying a Glider in the Swiss Alps, going to the Pyramids in Egypt without the heat, Hiking into a Volcano, Just wait in a few more years it will be smaller, better technology, which is even crazy to say, and the App developers are going to take this to another level for sure. Just maybe I will be able to drive an F1 Car in Drive to Survive or Drive NASCAR, in Need for Speed? The Future is here!"
2024-03-29,Every time Apple launches a product justine gets an orgasm
2024-03-29,"""OMG you get a free polishing cloth when you spend $3499 USD!!"
2024-03-29,"It seems like we’re witnessing a significant shift in the nature of webcams with the introduction of VR filters. While these filters can be innovative, there’s a concern that they might lead to an era where authenticity is compromised, as it becomes challenging to distinguish between real and digitally altered appearances. This technology, while impressive, could potentially be a double-edged sword, especially in terms of its possible misuse by scammers."
2024-03-29,so cool. sucks that i'll never be able to afford one
2024-03-29,Does iJustine get this excited at Hermes on Rodeo drive?
2024-03-29,Great fun energy. Thank you very much for sharing. This is my goal after tax season. I’m highly afraid of the crypto taxes. For sure this is something to look forward too.
2024-03-29,This is the true innovation while other companies still selling their fancy flip-able screen.  I can foresee how Apple Vision can truly reshape our daily lives within 2 to 3 years.
2024-03-29,this feels like something people won't get until they try it but unfortunately its too expensive
2024-03-29,In starting i just closed my eyes
2024-03-29,The FaceTime call was giving me black mirror vibes
2024-03-29,"the DJ app is what i've been waiting to see!! I was sad that nobody seemed to be developing apps that are actually 3D instead just floating ipad screens. I think everything on these headsets will be like that with ""physical"" virtual controls soon."
2024-03-29,To all Youtubers trying to demo the apple Vision Pro try not to move your heads to fast while recording your demos because it makes your video to shaky and you audience sick. make movements like you would as if you were holding a camera. For you it might not be shaky because you are immersed but for your audience it creates headaches. Thanks for the demo anyway!
2024-03-29,The essence of being a fanboy
2024-03-29,Hahah lawnmower man vibes I hope you don't become a super intelligent super villain that can control reality with your mind oslt hahah great vid very well told & shown thanks.
2024-03-29,this will drive basketball physical game watching sales down
2024-03-29,I hope this doesn’t seem rude but it sounds like the headset was pressing on your nose.  Or you had a cold. Sorry in advance. Just curious about the fit.
2024-03-29,Can you use VS code and code on it though? Would love to use this while I’m programming
2024-03-29,This is crazy I was dreaming about using vision problst night lol
2024-03-29,"She lucky, she got an Apple Vision Pro. Only Rich People can afford it, us as normal people. Nope"
2024-03-29,Future of computing: “MY HANDS!”
2024-03-29,I crave seeing a drop test on the apple vision pro. LOL
2024-03-29,"CAN YOU SHOW US SOME OF THE BEST GAMES ON
APPLE VISION PRO SO FAR."
2024-03-29,Looks dope
2024-03-29,"Man, I want one so bad"
2024-03-29,"""Everything other companies have done is all leading to this"" you mean"
2024-03-29,Curious how you capture or record what you are seeing? Quicktime video capture?
2024-03-29,My favorite review
2024-03-29,Imagine when they release the glasses
2024-03-29,15:48 i think your eyeballs are showing pretty pretty well
2024-03-29,I soooo want one!
2024-03-29,Hahaha she’s having a blast!
2024-03-29,I think it is kind of dumb that you HAVE to press the crown to open the apps. Why isn't there a gesture you can do with your hands like any other headset? Having to click buttons on your headset is strange to me for a $3-4k product. It has one of if not the best hand and eye tracking but requires you to press a physical button to open the apps drawer?
2024-03-29,"I'm considering to buy this device for one only reason, it makes possible to copy-paste images xD..., I can't do that with my Quest Pro, very disappointing :("
2024-03-29,Pretending like she’s hasn’t seen the dinosaur demo before.
2024-03-29,You all look like you got super Botox shots on your face on FaceTime.
2024-03-29,Its insane look how long did the back to the future to fulfill this
2024-03-29,Maybe I should buy one and keep it sealed as a collectors item lol
2025-03-08,"Just get a quest 3 , its cheaper"
2024-03-29,"nothing seemed like i would want to keep doing it over months.  it needs to have transparent displays that let me actually see the real world.  that would solve most of the impracticalities. after that they just need to solve the short battery life,  size and weight.  maybe in a few generations when its better and much much much much cheaper."
2024-03-29,"""I FELT THAT!"" lol"
2024-03-29,Ngl it looks nice but i just dont think the 3499 price is justified. Yeah it has awesome tech but im not really blown away by it. idk lol. Still love apple tho
2024-03-29,Apple Fan-Girl extraordinaire
2024-03-29,Just wondering who will be the first in a coffee shop to wear one lol
2024-03-29,Isekai video games or games where you are in first person rpg like swords arts online…. Here we come
2024-03-29,I love this
2024-03-29,"When watching video content, how’s the resolution and how close is it to watching an actual 4k tv? Can you see pixels?"
2024-03-29,18:59 was starting to get a little motion sick by that time yes
2024-03-29,That is the future apple creates that
2024-03-29,FaceTime is still need a lot of improvement
2024-03-29,"Justine's the bravest women, just the way she set the Vision Pro glass-down on the table. That's a greater stress than even skydiving."
2024-03-29,All american people love it 🇺🇸
2024-03-29,"I want one NOW
Gift me that, Justine!!! ️️"
2024-03-29,i need this !!
2024-03-29,@ijustine I wonder if you can do swipe to type like you can on iOS etc?
2024-03-29,15:49 Tongue gesture
2024-03-29,I would buy this just to make pointless presentations in the Steve Jobs Theatre.
2024-03-29,LOOL the video call
2024-03-29,Apple fan girl
2024-03-29,"This is not the future, Justine. This is just the best version yet of a very silly idea."
2024-03-29,Question: What happened if you are in the same physical room with other people using everybody at the same time Apple Vision PRO? (you will need more at least 2 Apple Vision Pro and 2 people at least)
2024-03-29,"I’m a big apple fanboy, i owned like 6 iPhones and 5 macbook pros so i’m not a hater of the brand at all. However, i don’t understrand why you are sooooo excited and acting like it’s the greatest device of all time. Off course it’s cool and great, but is it really 4 times cooler than a Quest 3? I don’t think so. Other than a really good looking device, eye tracking and features like facetime and iMessage, there is nothing you showed that is not offered on a quest 3 that costs 4 times less. I was able to watch a movie on the moon on my occulus go 4-5 years ago. 
I don’t understand why you got so excited when in reality, it marginally better than what meta can offers but at a serious premium. Hopefully new apps are going to use the potential of the beast but so far, it’s disapointing."
2024-03-29,She’s only this amazed because she’s never tried a VR headset
2024-03-29,This looks like it would “ALMOST” be worth the price tag.
2024-03-29,What kind of couch do you have? :) totally random question
2024-07-02,I might buy one If I marry Taylor Swift
2024-03-29,"Oculus 3 has allot more practicality with games and desktop ""work space"" with third parties and for a mere fraction of the price"
2024-03-29,It's incredible and even though it's still in Beta.
2024-03-29,AMAZING!!!!!
2024-03-29,"Ok... this is not the future
Trust me bros"
2024-03-29,"By all means, the Apple Vision Pro is a fantastic piece of tech, but the current accessibility features don't make it accessible enough yet for people who are physically disabled, as none of the accessibility features let you remap clicking with your fingers to clicking by blinking / winking with your eyes, which should be added. I am paralysed from the neck down and can't use anything other than my head, so those features would need to be added for me to be able to use it."
2024-03-29,"If you are not buying one, that's fine .. oh, thank you for your consideration"
2024-03-29,She have a different bond with apple products
2024-03-29,My thing is that this wow factor of having a screen in your room is not new to VR. just to apple.
2024-03-29,A lot of people say they would not buy it but hear me out. How many of you use multiple screen for work or play. Imagine you can easily be in front of a tv with multiple windows for you to navigate through and get done with work. Your phone is connected to so you can handle calls… text and etc all from one device. Color me intrigued. My wallet is not
2024-03-29,I heard it’s heavier than the Quest 3.  So not a good device to workout in VR.  Also that battery will hinder workouts.  Quest 3 is awesome for workouts.
2024-03-29,In short the best way to use Vision Pro is to use physical keyboard and mouse :)
2024-03-29,They need to use Optic ID to be able to switch between profiles for different people
2024-03-29,She probably got this thing for free but anybody else that buys this you're crazy It's not worth the money
2024-03-29,Typing on a virtual keyboard still supports only pointing finger? Just as in Quest?
2024-03-29,I love how she’s excited for glorified ski googles
2024-03-29,31:05 this is actually impressive
2024-03-29,Awesome gimmick for youtubers and rich's children
2024-03-29,The travel case reminds me of an airbag
2024-03-29,"An artic white case, what could possibly go wrong? lol. That won't stay white for long. 
Styling wise, it feels like it should have been a prop on ""For All Man Kind"". It definitely has NASA vibes (not a bad thing), more just that it is SO over the top built. What person is going to use up their 1 carry on bag for Vision Pro Case?"
2024-03-29,"4:24 for a £3,500,it better come with a £40 polishing cloth"
2024-03-29,"My one worry is as these things get better and lighter and smaller which they actually can be if you offload the computing power to a local wireless device, they will become more and more addictive. I worry as our real lives become more dystopian the compromise will be escape into virtual reality."
2024-03-29,Does it look like low fps because of the recording or does it actually look like that?
2024-03-29,How early did y’all get these ?
2024-03-29,Watched the verge review he had a lot more trouble. Like he said it’s magic til it isn’t or works till it don’t.
2024-03-29,Apple was come a long way
2024-03-29,"Uncanny valley indeed. triple A video games and personas simulate eyes really well but the suppleness and flexibility of mouths are still comically restricted for the most part. Lead lips. Still, I understand the work all those cameras are doing to begin to interpret what the lips are doing... I do  hope the performance improves."
2024-03-29,"Ok that's cool, then who is the target market for this 3500Bucks?"
2024-03-29,This thing makes us feel like we’re Gods!
2024-03-29,"Apple Vision Pro 2, that polishing cloth is going to be sold separately for $99.  lol"
2024-03-29,It's a VR headset.
2024-03-29,lmao came to see her exaggerated expression over the cleaning cloth after seeing the screenshot in reddit
2024-03-29,"Btw this is the worst excuse for a review ever. All you did was scream""Omg, look at this! Omg, look at that!"""
2024-03-29,FUTURE IS HERE
2024-03-29,"I love how Samsung didn't give damn about her this year too. 
She didn't make video of s23 and s24 series. Damn it hurts."
2024-03-29,good work
2024-03-29,netflix did a google daydream app from launch… the setting was a ski resort cabin… instead of the theater like the disney+ app…. it looked super HD and it was futuristic  to have a netflix huge screen inside the daydream vr… and all you needed was your smartphone and the daydream hardware…. i think that was next level… apple should do something like that but will never…. coz they want people to pay 4k for VR….
2024-03-29,"If there is one Apple device I want, it’s this.  Too bad it costs an arm and a leg."
2024-03-29,"22:57 ""look at this! everything is awesome!!!"" an almost completely pitch black room...."
2024-06-02,"Hi ijustine every time i see you, you're in a different location. Did you move? Where do you live at?"
2024-03-29,can you mirror the iphone or ipad… or is extending the desktop only for a mac??? i bought the OG google pixel because of the daydream VR… daydream vr was trully under rated… honestly…. I could do everything you showed on daydream vr… and tons of developers did stuff for it….not sure VR needs a 4k device… may be just a money grab from apple….
2024-03-29,They should have given a higher capacity battery pack and started with 512gb storage at $3500. 256gb at that price point is insanity. The 1tb version cost like $4k I think
2024-03-29,Please be careful when putting your hand out to the Dinosaur lol!
2024-03-29,"The travel case is sold separately? For $3500, it’s not included?"
2024-03-29,you seem to type faster then other people on the virtual keyboard
2024-03-29,Very nice indeed
2024-03-29,I really hope it feels premium so I get at least a little bit of acknowledgement  for spending an entire salary on metal and glass.
2024-03-29,"As a self-described apple fanboy, I gotta say, this is the stupidest shit apple has done since their mouse with the charger port on the bottom"
2024-03-29,"Hmm, does anyone else think Justine doesn't seem very happy anymore?"
2024-03-29,I could be wrong here but I think she likes the product
2024-03-29,"Watching the recording of what she's seeing, the video frame rate seems choppy. I'm wondering it that's what she's seeing or is this an affect of the screen recording quality?
The other question is how bad can the motion sickness get? I'm moderately tough against motion sickness, but when I watched a 360º YouTube video through a VR headset, it kicked my butt! lol. That said, using my VR for games didn't affect me,."
2024-03-29,"This seems like it would be awesome for people with disabilities, it’s very responsive"
2024-03-29,@itechlife kapan beli bang indra ?
2024-03-29,"I think it’s insane that you have 7 million subscribers but only 30,000 views per video I feel like the algorithm is like sexist or something this is seriously not fair for your channel."
2024-03-29,IJUSTINE UR MY MOTHER
2024-03-29,"Okay the keyboard typing is unreal man! I mean I remember watching in old days fake concept videos of future iphones claiming to have similar feature. This is like some fan made vfx video of what features vision pro could have. But in actual it has all those features. But you know what, 70% of the usage for that device is going to be on porn"
2024-03-29,Please be more critical. This seems more like an advertisement made by someone who has never used a Quest 3.
2024-03-29,I’m ready for SAO
2024-03-29,the charger thing looks like an ipod from the last decade
2024-03-29,"Someone - it's good?
Me - bro, it's made by Apple"
2024-03-29,This is worth 200 at most
2024-03-29,That's so coollll
2024-03-29,"Once the brain chip interface is built, haptic feedback can be simulated and typing will feel much more immersive, without wearing any gloves or finger accessories 🫨"
2024-06-02,"The only way I would ever be able to unbox one of these is if I was doing it for someone else who bought it 

Or if I make a disclosure ""This is a lender unit that I have to give back when I'm done making this video"""
2024-03-29,"7:28 - funny! ""If you do want to give someone guest access... you just have to ORDER the different size light seal"". Such is the Apple way ."
2024-03-29,Such a cool device! But way too damn expensive
2024-03-29,"que locura los apple
vision"
2024-03-29,"Could you comment on the Capacity? It comes in three configurations, but I have not seen why"
2024-03-29,Im getting one..or two!! ;)
2024-03-29,Would you recommend this for someone who doesn't have an iPhone?
2024-05-03,Imagine Microsoft doing there own type of this
2024-03-29,I’ll buy it in a pawn shop in a few years. Can’t afford the price tag now.
2024-03-29,did you say eye fatigue or iFatigue? 17:59
2024-03-29,I think everyone is hyping up pass thru mode. I doubt its as good as reviewers are saying especially with low light
2024-05-03,"I already got eye strain by watching these too much vision pro videos of Justin i need a rest 
Where is my vision pro"
2024-03-29,"I saw you at CES and struggled whether to pretend I knew you or not, but now I regret not saying anything. Amazing review on Vision Pro."
2024-03-29,i asume it is a bit more polished as something like a quest 3. but overall i woudnt pay that much more. also i dont like u dont have controlers. cause i dont want to do everything with my hands.
2024-03-29,Looking good really impressive but I am afraid I will use it 30 mn max like playing my PSVR2  =( and wearing a VR headset could be uncomfortable after 30/60 mn
2024-03-29,This will be good for kids based on this review...
2024-03-29,Commenting just to say I was here
2024-03-29,Thank you for muting Siri
2024-03-29,"21:32 - 21:35 don't insult God or use His name, have respect. Otherwise best review so far, very extensive."
2024-03-29,I love it ! But it does feel like a gimmick. It would be collecting dust in a week. But I’m looking forward to seeing where Apple go with it over the next few years
2024-03-29,Wow wow wow
2024-03-29,I really want one but i feel like IM TO BROKE TO EVEN BE WATCHING THIS
2024-03-29,A spatial computer and no sticker? Serious?
2024-03-29,22:53 who got reminded of the lego movie?
2024-03-29,aapl
2024-03-29,"Looks cool, but here in the Philippines VR is not big here it never is here. Looks ok.."
2024-03-29,Wait hold on wasn't this a black mirror episode at one point?!? Jesus Christ im scared mom come pick me up black mirror is happening irl
2024-03-29,Good review! But Its not as big as I expected. There is goggles already out there with similar features. Okay apple will have more and its polished but I dont think its that much of a new step .
2024-03-29,10:47 nahhh bro this is VERY MUCH SO UNCANNY VALLEY! ️ God bless us all!!! We are being turned into robots to the most finite and molecular details!
2024-03-29,28:25 This made me LOL
2024-03-29,This is cool.
2024-03-29,she had me XD at 4:19
2024-03-29,"I personally think, @iJustine has shown a true consumer experience of how Apple Vision Pro will be used. She really covered almost all of the basic stuff that folk commonly do, including a FCP edit. Thank you. I wish some other established content makers take cue, rather than being muted about it. Yes it AVP does have its issues (weight, etc) but its 1st gen. iPhone 15 was not made in a day. Thank you iJustine for the wonderful video."
2024-03-29,In your opinion Is it really that much better than than the Meta Quest 3 or even the Playstation VR2 as the price I 7 times the cost of a Quest 3?? And can you do a comparison video with the Quest 3 and the Vision Pro
2024-03-29,I can’t wait for the day we are looking back at this and laughing at how bulky and retro it looks.
2024-03-29,I like the Dj app that be fun
2024-03-29,I need one like now
2024-03-29,"when using Lightroom, how are colors rendered comparing to a real monitor?"
2024-03-29,"Wow, Apple Vision Pro’s box (little) same, MacBook Pro or Air’s box"
2024-03-29,No lie. This isn't worth 3500. Its more like 1000.
2024-03-29,"That was so freaking awesome. I think the DJ app was awesome. I agree this is going to be the future that we won't laptops, tv's, or phones within the next 5-10 years. Also your video wasn't long. it gave us all info we need to see how it runs and to see if we want to purchase one. Good job Justine."
2024-09-30,Wish I Had A Apple Vision Pro But Don’t Have The Money For It.
2024-03-29,"Thanks for your video, does it worth 3500$?"
2024-03-29,"I don’t know when I see you then, why Anna Gunn comes to my mind …???"
2025-03-08,To expensive in Canada but i would love one
2024-03-29,Que bonito video señorita
2024-03-29,"When connecting to a MacBookPro, can I use the same finger-and-eye method on the Mac screen?"
2024-03-29,but then the real question is can you use anyphone to connect to this or does it have to be an iphone i asume u have to use an iphone or apple product. and do u need to have a apple magic keyboard or can u use any bluetooth keyboard.and to have the monitor feauture i assume it needs to also be a mac (which it would be cool if u could use like a windows pc or laptop to get like another virtual monitor). kinda sad since this is like a breakthough product yet alot of the features are blocked to apple only products. considering this goes for 3.5k plus and if u want to be able to access all the features u would need to spend a couple thousand more for like a mac or an iphone or magic keyboard. would be so much better if apple stopped gatekeeping their products to apple only. oculus quest pro for me
2024-03-29,wow last emojie hey my english strange ? right idont know anyway have a nice day!
2024-03-29,"I lost it when she went ""i am swimming in the mountain"""
2024-03-29,SONIC DREAM TEAM ON APPLE VISION PRO!!!
2024-03-29,its wild
2024-03-29,"I'd say for anyone who actually uses VR, this is a bit disappointing"
2024-03-29,Hmmm. I noticed she had a hard time walking around with the goggles on using pass through. On the quest three you can actually walk around with no problems
2024-03-29,Look like the floating cgi head in Thor love and thunder
2024-03-29,a device simply made for hype reviewers and nobody else lol
2024-03-29,So it is like any other VR headset but with better screen.
2024-03-29,4:04 YES!
2024-03-29,Her review was as preditable as expected.....Appple is great!!! even though this thing look 100% silly wrapped around her head. i see no use for this. other than making your head spin after 1 min of use.
2024-03-29,"It looks interesting and I’d like to give it a go. But that battery pack is still poor no matter what way you look at it. I know it’s 1st gen, but we’ll look back at that and be like…. What on earth was that horrible thing. And the case looks like it still has the packaging on it ."
2024-03-29,"It’s almost $4,000.00 why are we so surprised it came with accessories for that price it should let me sleep n record my dreams  like this is months of someone’s rent or mortgage"
2024-03-29,How was motion sickness?
2024-03-29,Buy another and never open it for an investment
2024-03-29,I wish I had $4k just to throw around. That’s the biggest issue with getting this product to consumers
2024-03-29,This might be the best review for the Vision Pro
2024-03-29,Why they don't sell it in this nice travel case?)
2024-03-29,"Apple does th meta verse and suddenly it's cool, sheep people"
2024-03-29,Brian’s image looked most like him
2024-03-29,Have you ever given an honest review?
2024-03-29,is it worth the money ?
2024-03-29,"All I want to know is, does it hurt your neck or eyes or head in any way?"
2024-03-29,"I give it a month before ""the future"" feeling wears off"
2024-03-29,No Apple stickers
2024-03-29,They are awesome technology but I don't think I would buy one. I hate things on my face. I don't even wear a headset. Does it give you a headache?
2024-03-29,Most people around the World  who have an iPhone or any Apple Products have photos dating back as far as the YEAR 2023 ONLY
2024-12-29,Use this for salesforce!
2024-03-29,"I'm not a fan of this one, hope in the future we can move towards disconnecting from tech rather than immersing ourselves in it"
2024-03-29,"hello fellow person from the future, i know u came back here to laugh at how big and gigantic these are compared to what yall have now lol, but hey we didnt have it as good as yall do now! 

ps: have we gotten a red ipad yet or nah? are ipads still even a thing? maybe a slab of glass?"
2024-03-29,@iJustine looks like a female Jesus in Facetime
2024-03-29,"iJustine looks like she could be Crishells sister, from Selling Sunset."
2024-03-29,The thing that baffles me the most is that Apple is creating all this new techs but Siri is dumb asf.. iPad is about to get twice as expensive and productive apps are soo limited … how do you justify spending over $1500 for products that doesn’t give you full access to pro features n a virtual assistant that from inception is as dumb as a log
2024-03-29,I'd rather buy iPod socks...
2024-03-29,The way she mutes audio when she says “hey siri” so that all of our apple devices don’t give us the “hmm?”
2024-03-29,Nice ad when is real review drop ? I get it wanna make Apple happy because that’s how business works not public media.. but hey cut the magic part show the other side  it’s so sad nowadays technology reviews become movie reviews..
2024-03-29,when Apple sign lite up. Justine came.....
2024-03-29,I just want to see a real review with the bad things about the product
2024-03-29,i hope cloud gaming is coming on this :D
2024-03-29,You’re so funny
2024-03-29,Looks amazing! I am going to send mine back! WAY TOO virgin-ish! I will wait until they have a proper presentation !
2024-03-29,"Hello, Humans
Sometimes in life, you gotta look at the humans around you. If you don't like what you see, best move on to those who's company you can respect.

TERRANCE OUT"
2024-03-29,that is so insane
2024-03-29,"Oh, I’m not gonna buy it because it didn’t include a sticker I mean, if I’m paying that much money where is the sticker at?"
2024-03-29,Longer hair kinda suits Linus.
2024-03-29,So you have to pay more to let someone else use it?  Btw I know I can't expect an unbiased review from you.
2024-03-29,i’m gonna wait till they make the better one next year…
2024-03-29,"So its exactly like the quest 3 but just with a better display, for 7x the price"
2024-03-29,Can you use the Vision Pro without the the battery?
2024-03-29,I don't like when you moan in between the unboxing. That's just too weird. Relax. Love your videos though.
2024-03-29,Best Apple
2024-03-29,How did you get Vision Pro so early?
2024-03-29,I got CoverFow vibes here
2024-03-29,do play alot of mickeal old music focus in the lyrics wow !
2024-03-29,Can 2 or more people with vVsion Pro  watch the same movie using their own headset but viewing the same video
2024-03-29,"So does iJustine have anything critical to say about this product? Or is it perfect, like everything she so call ""reviews""?"
2024-03-29,Definitely they are amazing but I will tell this a 30 minutes use on your face will affect your skin pores meaning your skin will bread less and will affect your skin and face deformations in long terms . The skin on face and hands are the most heavy usage of air meaning they need oxygen more then other parts of your body .
2024-03-29,"I def aint buyin it if I can't even play BeatSaber



Good review tho"
2024-03-29,Wow ️️️️️
2024-03-29,"lemme guess, the seal replacements for ""Guests"" is about $200 bucks. Also....Optically locked? haha wtf."
2024-03-29,"there are so many reason to not buy this stuff. 
first is expensive. second to much stuff for $3500 for you to pickup( vision, battery, adaptor, cable, straps). third, it's battery life sucks. fourth, it's so weird using this . fifth, you may get tired wearing this. sixth , there is not much app can u use on this beta product. it's beta product for $3500, is apple jokes?? it's not as simple as the the price offer for $3500"
2024-03-29,The faces look way better for men than women
2024-03-29,Worst review I have ever seen. No sense whatsoever.
2024-03-29,"I absolutely love Apple products in their design, build quality and user experience but this technology is not quite there yet and people may never be ready for this technology. I think Apple may have a way better shot at anything in this realm with the alleged Apple Glasses. We’ll see if they actually make it to market. This may sound ridiculous but I think a barometer for Apple’s success of a product is how many people are sitting around in a Starbucks using it at any given time and I just don’t see people sitting around in a Starbucks using one of these. This thing also has soooo many underwhelming “features”. All of those cameras and the thing can’t even take a decent photo or video?!? One of the most attractive reasons to buy it would be to have a giant virtual display and it isn’t even really great for that. Being tethered to a brick doesn’t exactly conjure up the future is now vibes either and if I wanted to try to watch a lot of modern day films I’d have to be tethered to a brick tethered to a wall given its battery life barely hits 2 hours?!? I feel like we’re going backwards like if you wanted to talk on the phone in the 70s you were relegated to a phone in the kitchen attached to a cord attached to the wall."
2024-03-29,How many people are going to buy one and not open it to see what it's worth in 20 years time?
2024-03-29,the reality is you youtubers get it for free from the companies  and most normal people cant afford the stupidly high price apple is asking  for it im sorry but apple builds its stuff well but rips people off all the time
2024-03-29,OMG TE AMO
2024-03-29,Is it just me or does the case material look like it was cut straight from one of those puffy white space suits.
2024-07-02,"Most useless, overhyped and overpriced product by Apple."
2024-03-29,AirPods 2 max should have that case
2024-08-31,what kind of couch is that in the ~11m mark ish?
2024-03-29,How does this promote an active lifestyle….
2024-03-29,"Oh my god. Oh, this is so nice. Oh my god. Uh, uh."
2024-03-29,This is crazy
2024-03-29,"But what kind of review is this? There’s only pros, why don’t you talk about cons? How much did Apple pay you? Unsubscribed from your channel, I don't like dishonest people ️"
2024-03-29,Permanent cable on that battery pack is a cash grab.  Come on apple? You can do better!
2024-03-29,MY MOM WENT TO SCHOOL WITH YOU IN PITTSBURGH
2024-03-29,is there spatial gaming ?
2024-03-29,"after seeing her video, i'll stick with my quest. she didnt say or show anything, meaningful that would make be buy it. I'll wait & decide after MKBHD actually test it for a week or two & post his thoughts. After a couple of days of use & posting a video, just shows, the person didnt actually test it, especially someone that acted like a kid."
2024-03-29,31:34 I'd watch it even if it's 1 he long
2024-03-29,Is it still heavy when your wearing it
2024-03-29,"See verge's review, she is just talking like an apple fan girl with lot of hype & sugarcoating. Verge breakdown vission pro's pros & cons neutrally."
2024-03-29,"Vision pro is so damn cool. But @ijustine I really wanna point some things out about your reviews. I have been a long time subscriber. And I feel like your reviews are becoming more like just an intro for products than actual technical review. Especially about APPLE products. And don't get me wrong I also like Apple products and I understand how much you love them, but that's what should make you understand them better than most reviewers. And you should be able to criticize and also highlight their pros much better. But lately from few years I am not seeing that happening. Lately I watch your vids to get an idea of the product, but can't always just watch ur vid and confidently say that I know all about their pros and cons. I genuinely like ur reaction and childlike happiness for Apple products, but there should also be things that are beyond that in the review. Like for example the Vision pro vids of other channels have some really good pros and cons laid out throughout the vid. But in ur case I did not see it. This is a really good 1st gen product, but you should also be able to see some really obvious drawbacks. But you showed them on screen but did not elaborate on it ,it felt like u purposely glossed over them. I'm really not ur hater, just a long time subscriber who was actually waiting for ur review on this product. And I felt a bit underwhelmed by the review."
2024-03-29,Who will be the first person to get hit by a car wearing one of these?
2024-03-29,Again.. What is the added value of this thing??
2024-03-29,How is the view captured that Justine is seeing?
2024-03-29,Awesome
2024-03-29,I wish I had 3500 dollars to spare
2024-03-29,Best review!!!
2024-03-29,Does the Vision Pro support airdrop?
2024-03-29,Honestly the tech is very impressive and all and it’s very Apple design and all but the cost is too much. I can buy one or two oled display and a nice gpu for the same price
2024-03-29,You understand why the travel case is worth $200?!?!?! LMAO!!!! It’s just a travel case.
2024-03-29,Hey! Phipps!
2024-03-29,"I appreciate the energy, but do adults really get this excited over a piece of technology? Definitely no one that I know. I find it hard to believe that any of this is real."
2024-03-29,I hundred percent sure that Apple Vision Pro will be big failure when I saw they don’t put Apple Stickers in the box.
2024-03-29,"Whatta crap…  oh my God, I can see my hands"
2024-03-29,"Dead internet theory with so many bot responses, no way in hell people think this looks good. Wait for 5-10 years before this thing is fleshed out,especially the software."
2024-03-29,They forgot to put the IBIS in it
2024-03-29,Ca you open the blinds  ROFL
2024-03-29,14:12  do you think of what I think?
2024-03-29,The Machine Stops
2024-03-29,r u the sticker person mkbhd was talkin bout lmao?
2024-03-29,"Why is the Facetime not using real video of the people's faces?  I guess it's only because they would all be wearing Vision Pro?  Oh, never mind, I see: it's the Persona created prior."
2024-07-02,"So you see your environment that you can see anyway, but on a screen 2” away from your eyes.....yes I’m sure in the long term your eyes will not be happy about that. Just use a computer, which is bad enough as it is."
2024-03-29,Samsung be like we copy now....
2024-03-29,This is just crazy thing ️
2024-03-29,"Looks like quest 3... virtual desktop, same functions and only one diferents is the price and quality of displays. But where is Half Life Alyx??? Where is the table tennis?"
2024-03-29,When its calman verified colors for editing video with correct colors im in...
2024-03-29,Still not worth $3500. I think free things are great too. Buy it then tell us what you think.
2024-03-29,Why is the quality low when you show what you see through the headset ? Is it YouTube or is this 23millon pixels a lie
2024-03-29,For $7000 absolutely not
2024-03-29,"Apple should make an actual bra now , I'm sure it's going to be very popular"
2024-08-01,How are you able to hear the YouTube videos while wearing it
2024-03-29,It’s cool but I’m not spending that much on it. $700 to $900 is reasonable
2024-03-29,Apple told me not compatible with M1 computer only M2 and above.  Have anyone else hard the as? I see Reddit say some people are saying it works fine on M1 computers.
2024-03-29,sick
2024-03-29,Love you
2024-03-29,What’s clarity like because meta 3 isn’t crisp
2024-03-29,THIS “APPLE REVIEWER” SCREAMS PAID ALL OVER. SUPER CRINGEY.
2024-03-29,YOU HAVE TO SHOW THIS TO RO
2024-08-01,Hi from Taylor Carly and sean
2024-03-29,That travel case looks like a laundry basket full of whitey tighties.
2024-03-29,A lot of people with $3500 are just now having to face the truth that they actually are ugly.
2024-03-29,wow….
2024-03-29,"Don't get why u keep making ur ""reviews"". They are pure lie and have nothing to do with real life experience."
2024-03-29,"Why does Justine act like everything is so cool. Like with the polishing cloth or that terrible case. 

So many things I hate about this product/category 
1) the eyes are terrible
2) heavy
3) price
4) loneliness
5) just why?"
2024-03-29,i will pass on this Apple product. Great tech with no killer app. I don’t want to wear a head set to watch a movie or work on a Mac.
2024-03-29,It’s very cool but also very expensive.
2024-03-29,"skipping this one, gonna wait for a cheaper one and probs one with even more utility in a few years"
2024-03-29,Team quest 3
2024-03-29,"3500$ ??

No thank you"
2024-03-29,so a quest 3 with no games
2024-03-29,I so wanted to see this video but damn it Justine you are quite annoying
2024-03-29,But does Applie Vision Like ans Subscribe to this channel?  That is the real question.
2024-03-29,"no way,  she never experienced VR before. Why this reaction ""in"" Steve Jobs Theatre?"
2024-03-29,21:33 Such a Jennifer’s Body moment
2024-03-29,How much is it?
2024-03-29,looks exactly like the quest  yall gassing it up to feel better about spending that much and that cord hanging out is hideous.
2024-03-29,"Saying the FaceTime call is “impressive” and “9/10” is the biggest gaslight ever

Their movements and faces look ridiculous, almost like a parody of how bad it can be. It’s terrible."
2024-03-29,mkbhd's review was annoying af thank u
2024-03-29,Damn about over acting
2024-03-29,"But...the FOV is NOT what u see here, its like watch through scuba gear."
2024-03-29,"Такое впечатление, что эти очки выдавили глаза"
2024-03-29,Nice
2024-03-29,I am not convinced. Heavy piece of tech. Expensive too. WHERE ARE THE GAMES?
2024-03-29,Crazy
2024-03-29,again looking nice in your black tights!
2024-03-29,Journalism used to be Walt Mossberg. Now Apple gives review units to children making videos for the sake of views.
2024-03-29,"ty for the exaggeration and acted like all of features never achieved before. also please tell us how much money did you get from apple can’t wait to see your video after apple stop selling it :)

good luck fan(or bucks) boy ️"
2024-03-29,Sigh........this was annoying to watch
2024-10-30,O'Reilly Extensions
2024-03-29,"Yeah it’s cool, but can’t justify the price"
2024-03-29,I have this its awesome
2024-03-29,"Itd be nice to see a review not as a comolete fangirl


There is no real person use for this"
2024-03-29,Casi que me empiezo arrepentir
2024-03-29,I like your coverage but the energy and excitement seem fake or over emphasized.
2024-03-29,Imagine being drunk af while using this..
2024-03-29,Not available outside the US 🫤
2024-12-29,Does it have a mushrooms mode
2024-03-29,"MUCHA sobre ACTUACION!!! poco contenido. donde quedan las tomas cercanas los puertos, botones si los tiene etc."

2024-03-29,12:08 Who is this man?
2024-03-29,lol this thing is hilarious
2024-03-29,I just don’t believe in Justine anymore. Every Apple product is amazing with her. This one is clearly not amazing. The FaceTime personas… Excuse me but it’s just laughable! Not cool at all!
2024-03-29,wild
2024-03-29,Is she going to go to Netflix in Safari?   YouTube?
2024-03-29,"No stickers  that’s it, I’m not buying it"
2024-03-29,"Probably good this isn't available in Canada, I can't be tempted to bankrupt myself into buying one."
2024-03-29,Hi Justine  great video but you improve your thumbnails because it's a huge hype product no views on this video because of your thumbnail. Please reedit. Your thumbnail includes product box in thumbnail.
2024-03-29,That is neat and terrifying
2024-03-29,Definitely not worth $3499
2024-03-29,how about playing large games like GENS…… （headshot）
2024-03-29,Does this mean you cannot  set up your vision pro  if you dont own a iphone  this would be a let down  my samsung no good here dam apple.
2024-03-29,Great kindergarten review.
2024-03-29,"An iPad for your face. A product launched in a rush, that does not bring anything new to the market."
2024-03-29,Cool but still limited.
2024-03-29,What is the point of this device? An iPad that you don't have to hold with your hands?
2024-03-29,The worst unboxing video I've ever seen. Won't be watching her ever again.
2024-03-29,"Her performance was very exaggerated. I insisted on watching the 9-minute video and no longer wanted to watch it. Marques Brownlee's video was longer, but I watched it completely."
2024-03-29,Imagine playing fortnight in this
2024-03-29,Now how do we get my wife into it??
2024-03-29,This is a bit to much for me we heading to the edge of the cliff
2024-03-29,VR makes me dizzy
2024-03-29,Cool
2024-03-29,"God I want this so bad, but it’s simply unaffordable"
2024-03-29,Ijustine  looking old now.
2024-03-29,Am I the only one concerned that it will cause wrinkles if you use it a lot?
2024-03-29,"I think its a failure, its to big.
Its a mobile phone right??
Withi
ut sim card? Like no hate why it isnt a rayban eith usb C? Or are the sensors for typing so big?
I think this is just abother of those products that is there since there is use for the VR view bassicly 
Or are you xoming home and thinking.....Lets whats youtube at home? 
Something i wonder, i mean i think the Meta headset is the instand buy Vs this pure for its gaming sticks and games at the moment.
For professional use this might be it
I can be completely wrong of course.
I mean i use youtube on my switch so.....Without head strap!
But in that case the Raybans, seema bit more ready to go and use.
Its a beautiful headset, but are you gonna use it for youre editing
So can you do a full edit on the headset?
Wonder were they go, they definitely have the most Productive ready headset on the market with head & shoulders with the PC chromecast included!
So no hate! Seems like a pretty crispy clear headset and race!
But i think.....Its another far to big.
I was in. Brazil to the Mexican artis mysem.
Vr at the end, very fun really enjoyed it.
But its different use  for the bulky machine!
From what Ive seen.....People use VR for VR foto and videos and gaming....its used more then you think for professional use.....
So okey"

2024-03-29,Her reactions tend to be a bit overblown the way those sales people tend to be. It comes across a bit overacting but reality will be different for everyone.
2024-03-29,how did you get this?
2024-03-29,The apple VR is really stupid looking. There are so many better other headsets than this trash.
2024-03-29,How long could you wearing that
2024-03-29,lol @19:26
2024-03-29,Go watch the verge review for a real review
2024-03-29,the face skin wrinkles gets worse after wearing this device. looks really old
2024-03-29,"NO Marcus looked like he was a demons's meat puppet and you looked like Patrick Swayze was molding clay and thinking about what you look like. The other dude looked pretty good. My apple store told me I could reserve one for the Feb 3rd. If Marcus doesnt get me on the technicals you get on enjoyment and general usability. Both of you have sold me on waiting. I wanted to want this but I don't and that's a bit sad. I hope they come out with a "" apple vision "" nick named "" vision "" less expensive, 2024 specs (better wifi..etc), with litter material and a better headstrap."
2024-03-29,"Saying there a ""million apps"" is just false. They are not made for this 4k headset. Where are the killer apps? There are none. Maybe Gen 3 will have it. For now, its a hard pass."
2024-03-29,How come she got this before 2/2?????????
2024-03-29,Weirdly low view count for 7m subs??
2024-03-29,Why does it shake so much
2024-03-29,Can Apple Vision detect squinted eyes?
2024-03-29,Vision pro X-Ray's...
2024-03-29,"I mean, she's trying too hard to make it seem great! It's a cool idea but looks very rushed and meh! The good thing about this, now we will see who actually has money and who thinks they are rich because of ""blue bubbles!"""
2024-03-29,microsoft hololens done it first
2024-03-29,"i know we get it... you'll buy anything that apple create, so ennoying"
2024-03-29,"4 to 5 grand to move the entire genre forward a half inch. Lotta sizzle on this little steak. A lot of ""Imagine when you can this"" ""Imagine when we'll be able to that"" in the comments. That's what you're doing. Imagining. Imagining is free. Full-on commercial. Stop funding these people's careers selling you hype for things you do not need. Get out of the cult mentality. This will be lucky to ship a million domestic units before its a legacy device because it is not worth four thousand dollars. I remember when this girl was hawking a personal assistant home robot that never materialized. Every camera under the sun was the next big thing. Pitch after pitch after pitch. Infomercials on top of infomercials. Entire ecosystem from the product up through to its shills and its zealots looking for marks. The fawning affect, the over-hyping, the saccharine enthusiasm over common accessories like cleaning fabrics. Her ""energy"" would be ""sweet"" if the point of it wasn't to separate people from their money. Gross. Embarrassing. She'll be selling you some other crap in a few weeks. Looking forward to the influencer era of product commercials to draw to a close. This girl thinks you're dumb, and quite literally she banks on it."
2024-03-29,"The more videos I watch videos about this thing the more useless it seems to me, I mean it’s cool and all but that’s it, may be in a few years it shows its true potential, but right now it feels like a very expensive gimmick"
2024-03-29,Why it is so exiting about watching YouTube on the Apple Vision Pro. You can already do that on the oculus quest 2
2024-03-29,Congress
2024-03-29,"is it worth $500 ? 
Nope."
2024-03-29,McIntosh 128K $2499
2024-03-29,What about the weight?
2024-03-29,"I'm glad to see the rich Youtube influencers are enjoying their new almost-$4000 luxury toy. Not trying to be unnecessarily negative, just sad that Apple designed a product that so few can actually afford to enjoy."
2024-03-29,19:03 why wouldn’t Apple put REAL INDIVIDUALS or animated STARING TALKING AND MOVING - to make this one of a kind Practicing speech App?!  I mean that alone would have put this in productivity app!!! Just add some people in audience with that stage to practice stage fright or speech. They should learn from Samsung VR programs which are obsolete and Apple had bought companies with apps or video clips. Now years later after that it should be even better experience. But it’s Not. Common sense stuff for better experience is missing from trillion dollar company
2024-03-29,The white is nice but will be brown in a week…horrible color choice for a sweat band

2024-03-29,Play subway surfers on it
2024-03-29,This product is sow bad. Why you need a product when you can watch your pictures  shooting in your phone? Meta quest so much better then this product
2024-03-29,A 40 year old should not be acting this way.
2024-03-29,I do not like the wrinkles on the carrying case
2024-03-29,"Personally this is a failure. I want less devices to work on, and less baggage when I travel. Last thing I want is to put a hot thermos on my head making my head and eye sore at the end of the day. I dont understand why this is so hype when its clearly very uncomfortable and unnecessary,"
2024-03-29,Does the travel bag has a special place for an AirTag?

2024-03-29,"It's pretty good, but over acting is like phew.

Another review from MAC is more realistic."
2024-03-29,"I just don’t see the point in this device. Big Apple fan, but I’ll be passing on this."
2024-03-29,The case will be dirty in 3...2...1...
2024-03-29,"Heavy, annoying, no Netflix? Open ear speakers that leak? Looks like it would be hard to then wear alt headphones, $3500? Mmm I’ll hold off for now. I don’t see enough people willing to deal with this for the gimmick. Make it more wearable and useable without being a face helmet. I think this is too early. Just my thoughts"
2024-03-29,Over acting queen detected
2024-03-29,were beat saber?

2024-03-29,"powerful gadget... but I would be happy using it for 1 or 3 days. Create, but not as good for mare than 3 days. Sorry Apple."
2024-03-29,Does this woman have any kids?
2024-03-29,"Ok... yes it's a new $4000 toy, but bring down the fake hype."

2024-03-29,definitely not worth the price tag
2024-03-29,19:59
2024-03-29,It's putting SO much weight on your face and cheeks.
2024-03-29,"$3500 for so few features and questionable comfort, is it a joke?"
2024-03-29,Woww

2024-03-29,easy downvote.
2024-03-29,Wtf  this is crazy. Especially the DJ app. And type just by looking at it. Do you know what this means everything is changing after this. Apple just did this. Everyone will start making apps and growing off of this. Even cars everything. Mind blowing every other VR thing is just trash

2024-03-29,"Dude, do you need to change your underwear?"
2024-03-29,Nope. Not worth 3500.
2024-03-29,"the most useless thing on earth..... really, do you see yourself using that thing? It will be interesting for a couple of hours and then never touched again...."
2024-03-29,"This is not future

2024-03-29,This is ridiculous and has no useful applications.
2024-03-29,Overacting
2024-03-29,Of all the reviews I see she is the only one over excited. For now this is a expensive developer kit disguised as a prosumer product. If you are into VR you will get a little disappointed that you paid over $3000 over the Quest 3.
