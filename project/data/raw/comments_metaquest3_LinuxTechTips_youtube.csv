2024-03-30,"10:48 There are actually 3 microphones, one on the front for noise cancelling and 2 hidden in the gap on the faceplate for picking up your voice. This gap is also an air-intake so when the fan spools up mic quality drops substantially."
2024-03-30,"I do respect he spent this much money on the R&D for the Headset.

Most other companies would have just sold it as is. And update it based on user feedback over the course of a decade or two."
2024-03-30,"I got the Quest 3 recently, after having 5 years on the CV1. I had my doubts but I was absolutely sold the moment it booted up and I was shown my room. Part of why I still didnt use VR a lot was because the lack of vision to the real world, essentially its like having a big blindfold on at all times in VR. This changes everything."

2024-03-30,"Having used a quest 2 for 2 years or so, the switch to quest 3 was amazing. No more shuffling around to prevent flattening my cat who really loves sleeping under my feet when I'm in VR, no more worrying about getting the IPD perfect and having to adjust over and over to find the sweet spot.

Absolutely superior looking visuals in every way."
2024-03-30,"Having gone real hard into VR when Windows Mixed Reality launched and not upgrading since, the Quest 3 has been absolutely revolutionary. WMR was such a hassle to boot up, set up, and use. For anyone who jumped on the WMR train or an equal lower cost/budget headset when VR started to take root and has stepped away since, I think the Quest 3 is something that will bring you back and impress you."
2024-03-30,"I recognised Adam's voice before I did his face without the beard!

And I agree with him. A virtual workspace with passthrough seems amazing. Especially if one could move and resize screens on the fly."
2024-03-30,One step closer to sword art online
2024-03-30,"I love when linus talks about VR so that more people get into the cool industry and it gets a lot more developed. Love you, Linus!"
2024-03-30,"After having PSVR and then PSVR 2 for few months (sold it because Sony definitely forgot about it) I'm blown away by the Quest 3. As a PCVR gamer I wanted this basically for well, gaming on PC. The wireless connection through Virtual Desktop is flawless. I didn't know that in 2023 we can already have so good graphics and latency over wifi. The other thing is the headset itself. Great software and hardware. I have many games that I intended to play on PCVR but just bought them on Meta store - the graphics is so good. Love it."
2024-10-31,13:19 famous last words before the 3500 dollar apple vision pro
2024-03-30,"it's incredible how far VR has come, and it's nice to see how Mixed Reality is the wild west like VR was in 2016, it makes it even more exciting"
2024-03-30,"It'll be interesting to see how the Quest 3 develops over time. When I got my Quest 2, it was a 72hz only device and hand tracking wasn't even a feature. Since then, the software has changed a tonne, they've introduced hand tracking and various improvements for it, 90hz is now standard and 120hz is now an option for some titles. It's an absolutely insane leap from where it started on release"
2024-03-30,"Having an Index, a Reverb G2 with it's own extra set of lighthouses and knuckles, and now the Quest 3, I can rather confidently give the nod to the Quest 3 so far. The ability  to use the Quest 3 standalone, and even more importantly wireless to my PC has made it firmly into my daily driver. Just losing the need to have my position constantly in the back of my mind to track the wire even with a full pulley system, and the associated light tugs on my head as I moved, has been such a massive increase in immersion that exceeded expectations massively. Passthrough is also far more convenient and useful than I even expected. More time will tell, but I am fully endorsing Quest 3 at this time."
2024-03-30,"As someone who's been on the Quest bandwagon since the launch of the first quest, I have seen almost every feature that gets pushed evolve and get better.

For example hand tracking is massively better on the Quest 2 now than when the idea was first pushed on the Quest 2. It feels way more natural and functional, albeit not in all applications yet, its really neat. 

Same with the pass through tech, its gotten so much better and the beta feature on the Quest 2 to let you see objects in the area to include people and your pets even when in game is really nice, highlights a wireframe of them in view.

So the issues with panels not following you will surely be fixed over the life of the Quest 3, especially with people commenting on it publicly. I can't wait to get my hands on the Quest 3, hopefully the heat issue doesn't bother me too much."
2024-03-30,"I just bought the Meta Quest 3 a few days ago for Black Friday (no is wasn't on sale).  I saw the MQ2 was on sale and didn't know they released a MQ3 so I bit the bullet and used a $100 Best Buy gift card I had.  

It's embarrassing to say that I'm a big gamer and work in tech but I've never put on a VR headset.  When I first put on the MQ3 I was blown away, and was even more blown away by the games I played.  Even with not experiencing old/other VR headsets, the fact that I had such an amazing experience should speak volumes."
2024-03-30,Already spent more time on my Q3 than the total of my Q1. Awesome device! Really shows how the future for VR/AR is shaping up.
2024-03-30,"New to VR and this thing blows my mind.
I have those feelings I got when a new console came out that had revolutionary jump, like the ps1 did from the 16-bit era."
2024-03-30,"Quest 3 has renewed my enjoyment of virtual reality. I put less than 10 hours into my PlayStation VR in 4 years... But it was just a hassle to have to move my table, get all the wires hooked up, make sure my area was clear, and try to keep my dogs out of the way... Quest free requires so much less space, and I can do it anywhere wire free with the option to go pcvr.... The fact that I just put the headset on and boom it's ready to go, I really can't complain."
2024-03-30,"I knew your were ripping people off with your merch and screw driver 
But the 250$ fir a basic cheap jacket takes it to a whole new level"
2024-03-30,"Worked on the pass-through camera color for a while, and my good friend was the optical designer who designed the pancake lens. Kudos to her for making such nice optics. Glad ppl like it, cuz I thought the camera was a little bit janky..."
2024-03-30,I've had coworkers and family members try the new Mixed Reality of the Quest 3 and they unanimously agree that they prefer it over traditional VR experiences. There aren't a lot of MR apps right now but the ones that exist are really fun.
2024-10-31,"Apple Vision Pro isn't even talked about by Apple anymore cause it's over 3k dollar, here in October, you would forget that it exists being called a public developer kit"
2024-03-30,"One of the greatest features not mentioned in this video, is the ability to bring this headset with you to your friends and families home. Being able to let your grandmother experience VR is a feature in it of itself. The fact that this is a wireless standalone headset is a major pro against better VR headsets that require a powerful gaming pc."
2024-03-30,"I had the Oculus Rift S prior to buying the Quest 3, and its such a ridiculously massive upgrade in 95% of cases. Loving it, and i bought it day 1."
2024-03-30,$250 for a jacket?!... bro I always felt like your guys prices was a little inflated but god dayum!
2024-03-30,"This was a pretty straightforward honest use case review. The software will get better considering how fast the quest 2 was improved. Im glad you showed a clip of the Red Matter 2s quest 3 update. Im currently playing it and holy hell, if they can get that level of detail, while maintaining clean performance, with a lot of upcoming titles, it'll be incredible!"
2024-03-30,"I upgraded from my Quest 2 and I´m very happy, the lenses make all the difference, no more sharpness hot spot, you can wear it pretty loose and still everything is sharp even till the edges. form factor and controllers are way better, I bought a powerbank to charge while playing that works fine, in standalone mode you can charge up while playing, in airlink you loose a few percent per hour (3-5%)."
2024-03-30,"Meta is leading the right direction with VR, the passthrough is a step in the right direction, not only because of the AR capability but mainly because of it increased overall practicality and comfort of use which is probably the critical downside of VR and the boundary for wider adoption."
2024-03-30,"My favorite part about the Quest 2 was the fact that it did PCVR wirelessly incredibly well. Worst part about the early VR headsets for me was the cable, it just constantly made me avoid doing certain motions because I knew it would get twisted and nothing is worse than stepping on the cable and nearly ripping the headset off of your head

I don't think I'm going to upgrade from the Quest 2 since I really don't need passthrough at all but I'm glad to see the tech is still evolving and it doesn't seem to be dying off, though I'm a bit sad that PCVR has gone pretty stale"
2024-03-30,Loved it when he pulled put the sponsorship and linussed all over the Quest
2024-03-30,This man has gotten too comfortable plugging his store every 5 seconds.
2024-03-30,"Virtual Desktop is an excellent alternative to Airlink and works much better in some cases. Facebook started assaulting us with boomer vids as soon as we jump in so I am always running for the VD button. I wasn't expecting to see Cletus getting ball tapped by his cousin immediately after putting on my headset, but here we are."
2024-03-30,Since I was a kid I knew this is going to be the future. I'm so excited that tech has already come so far and I'm very hyped for everything to come.
2024-09-01,I just got the quest 3 and I must say the 3d effects in it is really understated. It must be how they angled the screens but it basically just feels like 2d with a hint of depth. Will be returning these for sure. Surprised this isn't talked about more.
2024-03-30,"i was SUPER hyped for quest 1, i loved it. i sold it a while back and have rly wanted to get back into pcvr and on the go vr (since im now in college). the quest 3 feels perfect for me, at least in this stage of my life"
2024-03-30,"wireless link options are growing pretty fast for this headset and should be mentioned. Virtual desktop and Steam link are both available, and I know the former supports video passthrough from the cameras. It also allows you to avoid installing meta software on  your computer."
2024-03-30,When we look at the Rift CV1 and the HTV Vive those headsets were both really amazingly well rounded for their time. These days it is more of them doing certain things well but falling short on other areas.
2024-03-30,"You should do giveaways!!! this December so people who don’t have a nice pc and have a lot of other expenses to cover with inflation and overall higher price mark ups,etc can feel what other people have been using on the other side, the transcendingly powerful and full potential pc experience in all its glory."
2024-03-30,The dodgeball test sold me. Quest 3 here I come!
2024-03-30,"I think the amount of technology that goes into recording reality, processing it through a computer, assembling into a 3d video stream, and rendering that back to your eyes in real time is hilarious. Y'all ever heard of a window? 

(Totally joking, I'm sure the screen technology to overlay video onto a window doesn't exist yet. It's just ironic)"
2024-03-30,This is random but I would love LTT to do dishwasher tier lists lol sounds like a home upgrade Linus would love to explore the world of dish washers for some reason
2024-03-30,Something I found out after about 2 months of owning my quest 3 regarding 9:56 you can double tap the side of the headset to enable/disable pass through.
2024-03-30,"I hate that a lot of the reviewers over hyped the clarity of the passthrough, maybe it is a great feature to have on a VR headset because most may not have such a feature, but dont sell it as if it was actually picture perfect great. it looks like someone smeared chunky Vaseline over the lens. I am not hating the OQ3 I just hated how many people said it was so clear you can read text on your phone with it. Technically you can but your eyes would hurt a lot due to how blurry it is due to how bloomed the image is."
2024-12-30,Good thing they fixed alot of these issues. Maybe we need an updated video. It's been a year since this one.
2024-03-30,"Something that really grinds my gears is It seems when Meta nerf'd oculus homes & specifically the passthrough mode on the starting menu of PC VR Rifts early this yr it was so that people couldn't compare using a 'productivity' mode on the Quest 3 to the Rift S (not sure if the link cable ever got it). Because if you don't mind grainy 'noir-like movie' living it's not that bad, obviously the cameras and depth is superior on the Quest 3 but I had been doing schoolwork on the Rift S as a sort of distraction-free  environment for quite a while. So when Linus says   he really means being a PC oculus user post May 27th of this yr (surprised Linus didn't mention this) still tho  of Meta to create this juxtaposition and honestly if there was a large enthusiast outcry (there probs won't be) then I could see this being compared to Apples nerfing old systems (though it's a bit of a stretch and probs wouldn't hold up in court). I'm still patiently awaiting an affordable/bayless PCVR system (that is supported by a majority of SteamVR devs) comparable to the Rift S, wonder if that ship has sailed."
2024-11-30,You guys should revisit the Quest 3. Meta has made nice software improvements since its release.
2024-03-30,"You know, something like the Quest 3 could be really cool if you built an AR app that used AI to memorize activities you do, look up professionals doing those activities to generate an ""average"" best method, and rate you based on your performance.  Gamifying real life could really make a difference especially for people with ADHD, some forms of depression or other cognitive issues that make focus and or organization difficult."
2024-03-30,7:10 seeing him without the beard is so weird :d
2024-03-30,"I think the price is pretty good compare to XReal type of smart glasses. I think VR has the potential of replacing the need of multiple standard monitors. High end large monitors are still going to be useful, but just college kids and people on the road, this really is a good option."
2024-03-30,"Damn, that's one expensive jacket 5:10"
2024-03-30,"I have owned a Quest 2, Quest Pro, Vive, Reverb G2, and a few other HMDs, and I can confidently say that the Quest 3 is the best of them all!"
2025-01-29,As a quest 2 user and new quest 3 owner.........the difference is pretty impressive.  Just full color passthrough at a higher res is worth the money.
2024-03-30,VR is the future ️
2024-07-03,Linus got PAID BIG for this.
2025-02-28,"As of two weeks ago I now own the Quest 3. I had previously owned the Quest 2 but returned it because I ended up having far more compromises to get PC Link working correctly and could never figure out the nuance of starting it up so I could run it off of a first party Link Cable to my PC. Until I realized that I really didn't want to run a cable all of the time, because it limited my movement in the space I was playing in. 

The Quest 3 pretty much improved the wireless Link experience, enhanced with the free Steam Link app through the Meta app store directly. No compromises and an excellent picture quality inside the goggles. The only things I need now are prescription lenses I can install so I no longer have to wear my glasses."
2024-03-30,"OG Vive owner here, also have multiple other HMDs (base station tracking and inside-out).

""Outside-in tracking"" (bast stations) is just better, plain and simple. I am excited to try out the Quest 3 though, when we have one in the house after X-Mas. Mostly for AR purposes though, I will admit.

Side note about Vision Pro... you know it's going to have a HUGE Apple tax applied, so much so that you'll get the same quality for 3-5 times the price. While it may be a 'better' HMD, I would put my money on Quest being the more bang-for-your-buck headset."
2024-03-30,"I had the absolute complete different experience regarding hand tracking. For me it is flawless, I have 0 problems with it, it's worked every single time that I've wanted it to work. I don't know if maybe you're saturating the quest with lights and that is making it to fail but on a normal house -lighting I can track my hands exceptionally well."
2024-03-30,"I've had a Lenovo WMR headset for around 6 years now. VR blew my mind but felt like a gimmick so far, with games I would play for 15 mintues at a time, maybe more with Beat Saber and such, but that's it.

I got the Quest 3 a week ago and it's blowing my mind still today. The clarity of the passthrough is pretty good, but just the fact of being able to see the room in real time is a game changer. I can drink, I can talk to my wife, I can avoid the dog, reposition myself... It feels like a perfect short-break tool.

I am also surprised at how well apps run natively in the headset, and PCVR is pretty good too. Of course there's space for improvements, for me mostly battery life (i'm playing longer sessions than ever!) and heat dissipation, but this feels like a very polished product.

I totally recommend it for people who want to start on VR but also for those who are a bit tired of wired options."
2024-03-30,"I feel that handtracking only got ""alittle"" laggy when they did the update that introduced battery saver mode, introduced, im sure they will have better tracking in the future on updates"
2024-03-30,the three pin accessory at the bottom actually seems nice. you can adapt to it with third party items and easily be able to create a third party battery accessory.
2024-09-01,"I just got my quest 3 and i absolutely love it. its so amazing and WAY better than the quest 2. For both play AND work. i LOVE the augmented workstation capabilities and makes everything so much easier for multi tasking

Edit: i feel like they've addressed some of these issues. ESPECIALLY hand tracking. I LOVE the hand tracking. Its way better than whats shown in this review"
2024-03-30,I don't know that I could wear a vr headset longer than 90 minutes.
2024-03-30,"Long time quest 2 owner, I basically only use air link which works as seamlessly as the video shows. It even leaves the USB free for charging so you never run out of battery."
2025-01-29,"That $80 official link cable is actually cheaper than other brands for the same type of cable. I thought it was crazy until I realized it's a fiber optic cable, making it more lightweight than regular cables. Similar cables on amazon are like 150 to 200 CAD. If you plan on using the PCVR link for seated games you can get away with a regular right angle USB-C 3.1 cable, some cables made specifically for this purpose even have a power injection port that keeps the headset charged while you're playing."
2024-03-30,You got me until no oled
2024-03-30,I have the Q3 512 version paired with the Pro controllers (bought separately) and I like it a lot more than the 2! I use it for stand alone and PCVR games as well
2024-03-30,"I returned my quest 2 very quickly when I bought it, I didnt like the controllers or the image quality. I was always getting vertigo anytime a menu would open in VR and I spent more time feeling sick and wanting to yank it off my head than I did playing anything, poker worked great and beat saber but everything else was just not usable for me. I got the quest 3 about 4 days ago and I almost instantly forgot that I have a gaming PC, the image quality is SPECTACULAR and I FINALLY dont get sick at fast movements. I can fire up population one and play literally until the battery dies and then still be mad that I had to stop playing. Ive never felt so immersed into games before, the hand tracking is more of a gimmick right now but those controllers are awesome. I did this really cool test in population one, they have a training area with every weapon in the game and a huge firing range. Now in most games im a self professed god tier sniper with a mouse and keyboard but in games like Apex I tend to miss shots a LOT. I grabbed this big sniper rifle in VR and got to load the mag and rack the slide and man did that ever make me happy. You get this awesome haptic feedback from the controllers and hear that bolt rack into place and then put your other hand out to cradle the rifle and then just settle right into the scope. With ZERO practice I walked up next to this guy that was missing every single shot with his single shot sniper rifle and just sighted down the scope and started nailing the center of every single target. I had to really focus down the sights and work to control my breathing and my small twitches because its so sensitive to every little movement. You have to find the target, sight down the scope, control your breathing, steady your arms, and squeeze the trigger just like a real gun. Ive pulled off some insane mile shots where I had to thread a gap and the amount of control I had to have to keep that sight right where I needed it was insanity. You can put your arm out and turn the gun every which way, I can pick up an smg and move while shooting at someone 90 degrees to the right of me, I can peek around corners, I can crouch and hide, I can turn the gun sideways and play gangsta if I want, the headset and controllers just know what you want to do and its so immersive. I get a little sick because im utterly terrified of heights when I climb but the second im up and standing it passes. Now when im climbing way up I have a tendency to just pause and look to the sides of me to just enjoy the view. I mean can most of us even remember the last time we played a game and just stopped to enjoy the scenery? Assassins creed was probably the last time I did that, the one where you play a Spartan, this thing constantly has me stopping to just say wow and then im right back into playing the soldier calling out as im clearing rooms with my squad. Then im over playing at the VR tables and talking to random people, or im off to play Bait and go fishing at a lake somewhere, or maybe I go into Meta Horizons and visit new worlds that have tons of interactive activities. I can fish and ride a boat around in one world, fly paper airplanes in another, its just endless. Theres so much stuff to do and then they have a subscription that gives you 2 free games every month that your subscribed and the games are like $30 each. I will not be returning this headset at all, its more fun than my PC and believe me im the most anti console person you could probably find, I hate being forced to upgrade to get access to new releases but VR is just so FUN. Its one thing to be involved in the story or run around in Apex but its another monster entirely when the gun is in your hands and you can hear the enemies footsteps around you on different kinds of materials, poke your head out and get blasted by a sniper hiding in a tower. Its dynamic and so real, its like a neverending game of laser tag or airsoft that you dont have to wait months to do and pay hundreds of dollars."
2024-03-30,Every weed smoker is so happy we can finally smoke a blunt and play VR
2024-03-30,"I absolutely love my quest 3. Upgraded from the 2 and it's definitely a noticeable difference all across the board.

Biggest thing holding back the performance improvements is devs updated their games to utilize all of the quest 3s resources"
2024-10-01,"so glad they made the cameras part of a new, less flat design. its nice seeing the tech industry slowly realize that smooth, white, and sterile is not what users who actually use their products want."
2024-03-30,"I upgraded from the Q2 and while I had my reservations at the beginning, the quality gains are pretty significant.

Can't wait for more games to become available for AR."
2024-03-30,"Bought one as an upgrade to my OG Rift, love it. You can use the Pro controllers if you want. Virtual desktop is great...This is the tipping point I feel that will pull more folks into VR. All hail the Lizard King!"
2024-10-31,"“That’s gonna cost you 40 dollars! For this flimsy thing?











THE IRONY BRO I CANT"
2024-03-30,"I've been using AirLink for years with my Quest 2 and Wifi 6. it's been perfectly fine for rhythm games since I purchased it.  I haven't really noticed a difference with my Quest 3, but I have yet to play some super demanding games like BoneLabs. I really hope my Quest 3 will charge as fast as it uses up battery at least. My Quest 2 never charged fast enough to stay at the same battery level."
2024-03-30,"Tried out a demo of it yesterday and wow, it's a massive improvement over my old Quest 1. Granted, it plays Beat Saber the same, but wow."
2025-01-29,"For gaming a 60w charger make the battery stay full all the time, the included 30w charger can keep the battery full if you only watch videos and similar light tasks."
2024-03-30,I just got a Quest 2 on black Friday. £231 due to a company discount and it included the elite strap and a carry case. Love it.  I can imagine using this a while and then maybe getting the Q3 next year. Will keep te Q2 though for fitness apps so my Q3 can stay sweat-free. Haha.
2024-03-30,"was looking forward to
this review!! i returned my quest 2 a year ago because I felt it wasn’t quite pleasant enough of an experience"
2024-03-30,"The freedom of untethered VR combined with powerful performance makes it a top-tier device. The future of virtual reality is here, and Meta Quest 3 is leading the way. Kudos to Meta for pushing the boundaries and delivering an unparalleled VR experience!"""
2024-03-30,You’re really trying to sell a thin ass jacket for $250……
2024-03-30,"C'mon dude, your opening fact was such a cop out. ""Half as much as the PS5""... what you should have said is ""more than the Xbox series consoles"". THAT, shows how mainstream VR has become."
2024-12-30,I'm watching this a year later realizing how much vr as a whole has advanced since.
2024-03-30,"@6:58 without your beard, you look too much like John Madden. BOOOM"
2024-03-30,"I demand a Somnium vr1 , Pimax crystal and Varjo Xr4 review ASAP"
2024-05-04,"I was skeptical but I really do enjoy the Quest 3. It's just very low hassle and just works.   I actually use it because it's so easy to use.  And while it's not perfect, it really does give you an exciting window into what's eventually going to be possible.  Even tho most of the augmented reality stuff is just glorified tech demos right now, if someone comes along and makes some good games using the augmented reality color pass through, it could be a big hit.  If you get to try the Quest 3, definitely check out the Augmented reality stuff it has first.  If that doesn't sell you on it, then you'll know whether or not it's for you.   And if you play the piano or keyboard, the augmented reality piano teacher apps that use the pass through are sooo cool.  It's like guitar hero for the piano, except you are really learning and playing a real instrument. (You need your own piano or midi controller tho)"
2024-03-30,"I have been waiting for this review since this headset released! 
You kept us waiting Linus!"
2024-03-30,Really well written video ! Transitions from chapter where really smooth!
2024-08-02,"“I might even be sold on it” what is wrong with these people that review things like this? They act like nothing is ever good enough for them. All I see online is how AMAZING this headset is. And I agree, I got one yesterday and it’s incredible!! I’d hate to be Linus tbh. Must suck to think everything is beneath your standards."
2024-03-30,"You want $250 for that jacket!? What the hell is it made of, high end silk?? I can get 2 almost 3 North Face jackets of the same design for that price. Yall really need to reevaluate all these prices I always see."
2024-03-30,Having used a quest 2 before in a buisness I would definitely buy a quest for myself if it wasn't owned by meta. Pity
2024-03-30,Holy shit...i figured they MIGHT have sold 2 million Quests TOTAL over the past 3 gens...not 20 million. I just wish VR was as good as we all wished it was
2024-03-30,This episode I learned how to spell segue. 13:34
2024-03-30,I feel like VR and AR is going to have some big advancements after the Apple Vision Pro
2024-03-30,"this is a step closer to where i imagine a future where people can customize the way they look to others.. if we establish a world full of quest-holes where everyone goes around in an AR enabled world.. i imagine people can set up their own personal avatars that get instantly shared to others in the area and superimposed over the real them to others.. 

I'd imagine the all unique customizations you can do to yourself that others see, whether if that's just adding fun accessories to yourself to enhance your vibe, or a complete overhaul with a generic cute avatar, or something wild, such as you as an anthropomorphic animal, or if into horror, a monster or werewolf, really, the sky's the limit."
2024-03-30,Nice to see you guys stepping more and more into VR
2024-03-30,I just wish it was oled or mini led. If they brought a pro model or whatever I'd pay 100 dollar extra for that feature alone.
2024-03-30,Yes Linus please bring more VR news and reviews!!
2024-03-30,"Have they done this “dual-host”-ish style review before?

The back and forth and seamless transitions between Linus and Adam was really engaging. Loved it"
2024-03-30,"Q3 was a slam dunk to replace the original vive. Virtual desktop + SteamVR and you'll have no reason to use the Vive again. Grab a Binbok battery strap and the battery life issue becomes mostly non existent. It will take 4+ hours to be a problem. If you swap on another battery at about 50%, you can keep on going. If you plug in a wire to one of those batteries at the back of the headset then you'll get tired before the headset does. It will stay charged."
2024-03-30,We need a VR app when your linus drops expensive pc hardware
2024-03-30,Meta quest 3 so good. AR is crazy
2024-03-30,"Regarding the ""can't go downstairs problem?""  You just need to use the ""reset view"" button on the controller and it resets all your interfaces relative to your current viewing position.  Simple."
2024-03-30,"Great review, thanks Linus!! I would say the tracking isn't that bad in my Quest 3. It still needs some lighting and poor lighting can make it suffer, not nearly as bad as my previous HP Reverb G2 but some lighting is necessary. I abolsutely love my Quest 3 and game in it frequently, mostly PCVR but some titles on the Quest store as well. Good job Meta!"
2024-03-30,"The one annoyance is that they moved the 3.5mm jack to the right side of the HMD.  Now, I was able to resolve that by buying a short right-angled 3.5mm extension that I routed through the top loop.  (I use a modified BoboVR M2 Pro via the M3 Upgrade Kit.)    This was mostly an issue because I purchased the (overpriced) Logitech IEMs that were designed for the Quest 2."
2025-01-29,"I love the machine and its solid quality. I have been pushing it to the most extreme limits, running it for hours on a cable. It does get hot, but there is a fan built in to vent some of the heat.  The controllers are far better, the grip button not breaking as easily as the Quest 2 controllers did. I do wish they would make it easier to adjust the graphics."
2024-03-30,If you think they LOST $47B on research and development I got some beach front property in Arizona to sell you.
2024-03-30,"From my experience with the Quest 2, meta does a good job with their software updates so things like the hand tracking accuracy, and features like pinning tabs or having them stay at your level going down stairs and stuff i honestly think will be improved and fixed within a year or two at most. time will tell though."
2024-03-30,"Heads up, the info at 12:32 isn't exactly right; the lighthouse stations are 60hz total, NOT each, so 1 Vive station will be 60hz but 2 will be 30hz. However, I've seen some info online that suggests this is resolved when using a linking cable."
2024-03-30,Is the fart at 2:50 really necessary?
2024-07-03,"This video was horrible, down to the cuts to the sarcasm."
2024-11-30,The irony of how much Meta charges for their cables and the sponsors cables at $99
2024-10-31,quest 3s review wen?
2024-03-30,"Meta has pretty much completely abandoned PC VR. The desktop app has not changed (removed Home completely) and they do not release PCVR games, even though that's what brought Oculus to the front when it launched."
2024-03-30,"As for the question you mentioned about battery life, I watched a youtuber's review video about Aubika's fast-charging headset, which effectively extends the QUEST 3's playtime to over four hours, very tempted, but still on the fence..."
2024-03-30,I just got a Q3 and it really is incredibly good at what it does. They desperately need to refine the software though. Missing almost every QoL feature you can think of.
2024-03-30,7:30 WHO IS THAT WTTFFFFFFFF
2024-11-30,"Honestly getting one now about a year after launch as well as the new release of the 3s, I can honestly say if offices implement using these as an option instead of just a standard cubicle set up I'd be more willing to show up in person to the office"
2024-03-30,The Quest 3 seems just about perfect for what I want out of a headset. I still wish there was support for outside-in tracking though or maybe just sensors on the rear of the headset to pick up when your hands are behind your back. I had the opportunity to use an Oculus Quest for a few days at a buddies house and I remember having issues in shooter games reaching for ammo or something at my sides and rear.
2024-11-30,"@LinusTechTips, you need to make another video"
2024-03-30,The microwave bit though. That was pure comedy gold.
2024-03-30,"I love my Quest 3.  For those that have a PC, look into Flatscreen to VR mods.  It takes half life games to a whole new level.  Skyrim VR with mods is amazing.  One step closer to Ready Player One."
2024-03-30,You can’t talk about wireless PCVR on Quest (and Pico) without mentioning Virtual Desktop. The performance is extraordinary in comparison to AirLink and it also supports Passthrough and much more!
2024-03-30,"Funny how the Apple Vision Pro made the Quest 3 accessories look cheaper in price. 
I can name the Quest 3, BEST VALUE VR"
2024-03-30,"I think the biggest issue is trying to by the sole driving force and caretaker for something as insane as the idea of the Metaverse, and Meta/Facebook has clearly put their entire priority into trying to justify the Metaverse’s existence, which nobody is being sold on due to its dystopian-level experience. While R&D is a major factor in financial loss, it’s not the only factor."
2024-03-30,Adam is a good script writer
2024-03-30,"All we want is a lightweight, 5k pancake, 144hz @120degrees FOV, wireless(unteathered) headset, with integrated insta360 4k, 120hz 360 cameras"
2024-03-30,"The Quest 2 is already being abandoned sadly. Plus, there are software issues with Oculus Link that have existed since launch and have not been fixed. I don’t trust Facebook (sorry mEtA) at all… for anything…"
2024-03-30,"As an avid meta 3 user, this is 100% exactly the video we needed"
2024-03-30,"It'll be hard to get an actual expert and unbiased review on the apple vision, Im honestly looking forwards to watching yours."
2024-03-30,"Would be nice if you also included Virtual Desktop for wireless VR on Quest, it's miles better than Link or AirLink and it's developer is very active with updates."
2024-03-30,"Gotta say $3500 seems like alot for Vision PRO, but theres's no question that outside gaming it DESTROYS the competition for AR/MR. Like pass through mode on the quest 3 looked impressive until last week and now it looks like it's 10 yr old technology. Quest 3 pass through mode looks like a joke now. Kudos Apple for pushing the envelope even if it means pricing out the majority of users"
2024-03-30,"being able to click a button to pin something to your vision as part of the ""hud"" vs the ""things around you"" is probably a deal breaker for me.  My main goal is to use it as a hud for keeping me focused on my tasks and not getting distracted from my plan for the day"

2025-03-16,"Got my for birthday, if you like gaming like i do its so great experience. It's insane and this passthrough is something i cant believe it was not there previously. It's like a killer feature because you can just have monitors or youtube or whatever while talking to some1."
2024-03-30,"""That looks like a real chair on the floor!""
""Oh it IS a real chair on the floor...""

This is the intended target for VR. People so unaware of their surroundings that it's easy to make VR seem like an amazing adventure."
2024-03-30,I enjoy the standalone aspect of it. It also allows me to play my PC VR games without a wire. For the price its pretty awesome.
2024-03-30,"The pressure points on the face are not so bad once you learn after about 1 week of wearing it how to adjust the straps properly. You don't need the elite strap if you just keep playing with the standard one. The only down side to this is you don't want to share your headset once you get the strap dialed in. 

Do not share your headset with someone who wears glasses, the lenses will get scratched, even if you fully extend the faceplate."
2024-03-30,Linus complained about paying 40 dollars for the silicone headset interface but then is charging $15 for a cable tie on his website
2024-12-30,"I would say buy this BEFORE you buy a PS. It's like being in a different dimension. There is no other tech experience like it. I used to think that these VRs aren'tworth it and just a gimmick. Can now vouch for it. It's absolutely crazy! Everyone should own them. Forget gaming, simple things like wearing it and walking through a lake in Scotland are nothing short of magic."
2024-10-01,13:30 that zuckerberg lizard meme. i cracked up upon watching this
2024-03-30,"Ahem, sponsored by Mark Zucker"
2024-03-30,The charge port / PCVR connection issue having to have a zip tie and unique cable to make it work well is unacceptable to me. It's been an issue since the Quest and it's so damn easy to include some stuff to make it work the way it should
2024-03-30,"I think reviews like these need to address Privacy issues going forward. Not just for Zuck stuff, but all the stuff."
2024-03-30,00:08 No teleprompter clearly fake!  Seriously though mad respect on these outdoor shots.
2024-03-30,"As the owner of many PCVR headsets, Quest 3 is da bomb comparatively and can only get better with future iterations.  Untethered VR headsets are the future and I'm all onboard with this one! This headset plus Steam Link = VR bliss for untethered PC gaming. Now bring on those oled screens meta!"
2024-03-30,"Has anyone been feeling like the quality of LTT videos have been really good lately? I am so glad that Nexus came forward with what he did and for LTT team to take the L and coming back strong.

Now the only thing I hope is that they give an update about Billet Labs (honestly that was a grand mistake :\) 

But I am glad LTT have changed their working culture! These videos are surely of great quality!"
2024-12-30,"I do have an apple Vision Pro with which I am delighted.
One of its best features is the ability to replay panoramic photos and immersive photos, that I’ve taken on my iPhone 16, which look stunning.
I want to show these in particular to others so have purchased an Oculus Quest 3 since the AVP is both cumbersome for others to wear and needs setting up for each individual.
However, I’m very disappointed to discover that those photos are too high in resolution to be displayed as panoramics or immersives on the Quest 3.
But the resolution of the panoramic and immersive samples on the Quest are even better than I had hoped.

The idea of reducing the resolution of my photos is a complete anathema."
2024-03-30,Imagine doing chores and running errands with quest 3 on
2024-03-30,That Porsche Taycan needs an NCIX bumper sticker
2024-03-30,"Man, thank god for add blocker"
2024-11-30,This needs an update and a Quest 3S review. A lot has changed since this video
2024-03-30,"I wish I didn’t have to say this, but outside in tracking is a bit of a hard sell because I don’t know how many people would be able to dedicate an entire room to playing VR. With inside out tracking, you can play anywhere."
2024-03-30,I feel like the YouTubers are getting different headsets as our passthroughs don’t look near as good.  I went out and got 200 watt equivalent bulbs for my house to make it look better but still doesn’t look as good as Linus.  I only bring this up so you have realistic expectations because it is still awesome.
2024-03-30,"Excellent video, thank you. I built myself a top of the range RTX4090  PC this year & I'm wanting a VR headset that will take full advantage of it, so your video is incredibly helpful. I think your takeaway message for me is wait a little longer for either the ""big screen beyond"" or possibly a Steam new release for high end PC VR gaming, for the best possible experience. Thank you!"
2024-03-30,"We get to see Linus. Yvonne has to live with Linus.
Not all hero's wear capes. Thank you for your service 🇺🇸"
2024-03-30,"9:55 If you double tap the side of the headset with your controller or hand, you can flip back to passthrough whilst connected via link !"
2024-03-30,Can't go one video without mentioning Apple. Linus an apple fanboy now.
2024-03-30,"Accounting: “Sir, we lost Twitter.”
Zuck: “What??”
Accounting: “I mean we lost 40 billion dollars.”"
2024-09-01,Virtual Desktop is really the core of what made the quest a great pcvr experience
2024-03-30,The fudge happened to adam's face? I had to pause the video to recognize him... YEESH!!!! That trim my boy de-aged you a whole 2 decades. Looking sharp
2024-03-30,"I've owned every Oculus headset since DK1, and I was really unimpressed with the specs for the Quest 3 and the preview videos which barely look better than the Quest 2. I also didn't give 2 cents about the dumb AR stuff. But, I went ahead and bought a Quest 3 figuring I'd just play with it for a week and return it when I was unimpressed. Well - so much for that idea. The AR stuff, and color pass through, was so much better than I was expecting, that it pretty much instantly became the reason for keeping it. Also, none of the games I had were updated for the Quest 3, so as far as graphics go, I wasn't really impressed - then I went ahead and bought Red Matter 2 - an wow, what an upgrade, that was the first (and so far only) game I've seen that made me take notice and really be impressed and think this is, in fact, a next-gen unit. I think Meta is facing the same issue you always have with VR, and that is how you advertise it to people in 2D, and I'd say they've done an exceptionally poor job of advertising the Quest 3. In person, it's a much better upgrade over the Quest 2 than I thought it would be. Although I'll disagree with Linus on the awful headscrap - throw that thing away and get a 3rd party battery strap, they're so much more comfortable and basically double your run time, for like $50."
2024-03-30,Great Video! I may be out of date but I love the new people that you have in this video. Hope to see them more in the future videos
2024-03-30,"9:56 You can still use passthrough, double tap the side of the headset. Also I have no idea how you got better tracking on Quest 3 compared to Quest 2."
2024-03-30,"As for the heat you mentioned, yes, mine is warm too. But it's not that bad. It didn't effect me when using it nor does it damage the headset. 

I'm pretty sure there's a fan inside because I can feel the air coming out. 

And the battery life does suck. But fortunately there is a headstrap that comes with 2 batteries, which can increase use for several hours before running out. And if you get a third battery, you can play as long as you want and not run out."
2024-03-30,How can I watch this and not feel shilled to when you swore allegiance to Bigscreen Beyond yesterday?
2024-03-30,Hey Linus you should redo this video but with the face plate that sits on ur face off and a halo head strap that seats the headset to ur forehead instead. It’ll increase ur FOV and completely open up your peripheral vision. To the user best way I can describe it is it’s like ur wearing glasses with thick frames. Quite amazing the difference u get it basically turns it into a quest pro
2024-03-30,Bro the microwave Scene literally made me jump
2024-03-30,"Just got my Quest 3 after like 3 years of having my Rift CV1. I just hang out in VRChat a lot, and the screen quality and improved lens was a noticeable improvement immediately! Passthrough just makes it feel like an actual generational step forward. Honestly, if I had any SteamVR setup, I would have stuck with it, but from the dead end of Rift's upgrade path, the Q3 is great."
2024-03-30,"You can buy third party headstraps, extra battery packs, link cable etc. There is NO need to get robbed by meta"
2024-06-03,"I don't get the complaints over the hand tracking? I have Quest 2 and it works great! Not as smooth but it's cool and fun, and I heard that the 3's hand tracking got better"
2024-12-30,For the price of a Vision Pro you can buy a gaming monitor ánd a gaming laptop and have money left over.
2024-03-30,"I think we already need an update as Valve just announced wireless VR streaming via Steam Link app for Quest 2, 3 and Pro."
2025-01-29,"I would love to see you review the Xreal One glasses with the Beam pro and Eye
So far i love mine and would love to hear your input and see your tests on this device."
2024-08-02,"To me, VR is still a gimmick. One day in the future it’s going to be awesome, just a pair of goggles that can play your PC games wirelessly with 8 hours of battery life, no screendoor effect, no motion sickness, perfect hand tracking with sensory feedback gloves. But I’m going to be 6 feet under at that point"
2024-03-30,"Linus...while using the Meta Quest 3 VR headset, should you ""accidently"" fart ...does it explode into a 3D reverberarion???  Enquiring minds want to know??"
2024-03-30,"I've only had my Quest 3 about 2 weeks now, but I'm extremely happy with it. Can't say I've noticed any chromatic aberration, except maybe at the very extreme edges of the lenses with high contrast shapes. I had an Odyssey+ for years, so even on the Quest 3's worst day, it's much clearer than the O+ ever was."
2024-03-30,I use a 10k mah battery pack in pocket with the included charging cable to offset the low battery life. Works best in a chest pocket.  This thing is light years of upgrades from my og oculus rift would recommend to anybody easily.
2024-12-30,"Passthrough with PCVR is possible using ""Virtual Desktop"" app, and some remapping of the game texture to green/blue (even on Quest 2). However, Virtual Desktop is Wifi only (because it resides in the ""Stand-alone"" OS). That is quite a limitation. Some games benefits from a wired data throughput..."
2024-03-30,I will probably stick with my Quest 2 and Valve Index combo. This doesn't really seem like enough of a upgrade when it comes to VR.
2024-06-03,"What comes to battery solutions in VR, the only real answer is what Apple did, there is zero reasons to sandwich the battery between the displays and the passthrough cameras. Put the batteries and preferably also the computing unit into a separate portable power bank configuration. That would make the headset even slimmer and lighter by a significant amount while you could also afford to AT LEAST double the battery size."
2024-10-01,"Putting that charge port on the headset strap mount was a big oopsie, I was wondering why there were so many with that particular side broken off. I'm going to guess one good trip on the cable will rip it right off so anyone thinking about getting one of these, keep that in mind. I recommend not using it wired unless it's to a battery bank on the back of the headset straps."
2024-03-30,"Battery life isn't such a dealbreaker. Just buy a external 8000mAh battery pack with a more comfy headstrap (leather and with rotation dialknob to tighten it up ) and you're good for 4 hours or more. When plugged in my quest 3 keeps at 100 or 99 percent for couple of hours.
Besides that i'm blown away by this tech in a way that litterally my jaw dropped how advanced it is now.
And now playing doom vr. Prey vr. Jedi outcast vr, doom 3 vr, half life vr thanks to SideQuest.For PCVR it's unbelievable sharp. Using it with the original quest link cable of course .  And those pancake lenses are amazing. No chromatic abberation at all! In comparison with psvr2 well this thing dominates"
2024-03-30,Would be very cool if you did a review of the Varjo Aero.
2024-03-30,"There is an Error in the video at 10:45 - there is not just one mic on the headset. There are two microphones inside, the one on the front is for ambient noise cancellation/isolation."
2024-03-30,i find saying that they are the best vr maker a big thing to say they are the biggest standalone vr headset maker. On pc i would say that the valve index is huge.
2024-03-30,You can just use the menu to center the view again. It works as you would expect so that way you can set the screen from where you are.
2024-06-03,"Until last week I’d never heard of the meta quest before a work mate of mine was telling me about it so I went down the rabbit hole on YT now it’s my most wanted item  so I’m now saving to get one, I actually have the ps4vr (which I hardly use) my main complaint with the psvr is the fact that there’s to many cables whereas the Meta quest 3 is wireless"
2024-03-30,"I don't want to spend above 1000 USD for VR, and in the price range of 500 USD, I believe this headset is the best ""multi-purpose"" headset, with the possibility to work standalone, for ex for watching a film, play some funny pc games, do some remote desktop yet see your true hands, going on a trip with flight simulator or shoot enemies with DCS. Most probably my next buy."
2024-12-30,"So i was thinking about somewhere in the future where we could build a real ""Airplane cockpit with real controls"", but the VR helmet superimpose an ""outside image"" where the windows of the cockpit is. So we can get the best physical feedback with real controls while simulating the outside.  As we can see in this video, passthough is only available in ""stand-alone mode"" so there would be no way of applying that to PC Games (like Kerbal Space Program). Looks like i have to wait for better progress in technology. The ""warping effect"" seems to be still present in the Quest 3... i'm not sure it it will ever go."
2024-03-30,"I did in fact think about getting a second-hand Quest 2, but with VR headsets I just don't like the sanitary downside of that. Got a new one instead, which is still roughly half of the price for a Quest 3. For mostly link-based gaming the Q2 is actually quite a good option if you don't wanna spend a load of money."
2024-03-30,Whether or not I like the video solely depends on the quality of Linus' ad segue. Liked.
2024-03-30,I traded something for the quest 2 with a friend. I had it 4 days and then I went and bought the Quest 3. I don't regret it at all. Id only buy the quest 2 if spending that much on the 3 just absolutely isn't an option.
2024-03-30,"The thing i like the most about the quest 3 is that it has RETROCOMPATIBILITY with certain quest 2 and pro accessories, the quest pro controllers work perfectly with it"
2024-03-30,The fact that they cant even just have a normal view through the camera without everything warping like a bad LSD trip.....Garrrrrrrbage. VR still has got a long long way to go before mainstream appeal.
2024-03-30,I would also say the game library is better than all the current standalone headsets
2024-03-30,I would have absolutely lost it if you were playing a dish washing sim on the Q3 in the kitchen right next to an actual pile of dirty dishes. LOL
2024-03-30,"Yes, it does get . I was setting up side accounts for our Sons, I had it on my lap and literally just about burned my leg. Ours froze up a couple times. I held Vol up and power at the same time a few seconds and a picture of a droid laying down with this ️ but it was red. It might be because of over heat but not sure.
I edited for misspelling."
2024-03-30,"can we just acknowledge how different Adam look without his beard, not in a bad way though"
2024-08-02,"""the quest 2 isnt going anywhere""

sigh"
2024-03-30,"At 04:14, I was impressed with the editing (I barely noticed the transition when focusing on Linus). I don't really think ""2 hours"" is a gaming session, it's a healthy hobby, but not a ""session"" so to speak. For me those are 4+ hours, and personally I don't get bored of one game until at least 8 hours passes (if it's a good game). As for the AA batteries, I think that's a good thing. Again, this is just me personally... But I ALWAYS use rechargeable batteries, and the same batteries easily last 3+ years (lifespan not power)."
2024-03-30,VR can give me motion sickness so I find AR much easier to deal with. I recently picked this up and have been enjoying it but more importantly my daughter is too. First Encounters is very fun. I'm looking forward to new apps and games in the future
2024-03-30,"Too bad the Quest headsets need a Facebook/Meta account and heaps of extra software to be installed to use it for PCVR, massive dealbreakers right there imho"
2024-03-30,"It'd be nice if the pass-through headsets could track ir-leds in fixed positions. Like playing simulator games (rally/flying) and having something like ir-battery-gizmo on the controller and the vr goggles would always show where your controller is & perhaps have some fixed points that you could calibrate for fixed ""front"".
Ofcourse my experience with VR is with old HP headset that worked amazingly in flying sims like DCS, has passthrough - that didn't work in games outside steam vr api (iirc) and if you let go of joystick (& especially hotas) you'd have to blindly feel around the general area of table to find them again."
2024-03-30,A big problem with your  passthrough image quality is your lighting it needs about double the lighting that you need to see to get rid of the graininess that is why everything other than your cooking demo had much sharper images
2024-03-30,Those wobbly edges to things made passthrough impossible for my friend that used to be into hard drugs. He couldnt get it off of his head fast enough
2024-03-30,Watched this after your Vision Pro review. I’d highly suggest that.
2024-12-30,"About Linus' point of the price... you can buy THREE Quest 3 headsets for the price of a Beyond and Valve Base stations. And with the leaks going around, to me at least, Deckard seems more like a Steam Deck taped to your eyes than anything."
2024-09-01,"""Imagine how good the Apple Vision Pro will be"" -- aged like milk"
2024-11-30,"I love it how Linus cringes when some brand charges outrages amounts of money for something so basic and goes on intrigrating his own hoodie for 250usd, are you out of you damn mind???!"
2024-03-30,So you say anyone with PCVR shouldn't get it. But then you only compare it to the latest and greatest of lighthouse outside in...but what if someone's rocking an old CV1? Then is it worth getting?
2024-03-30,"As Quest 2 occassional user I am not sold on Quest 3 upgrade. I dont think mixed reality is worth it. In VR you get the FoV and some extra shadows, but I wonder how many games have made the upgrade. Other people comment the games are not upgraded. For good PCVR I guess its worth it. Waiting for next iteration :)"
2024-12-30,"$250 dollars USD for a jacket?????? 
wTF"
2024-03-30,Can’t wait to get a quest 3! I had a 2 years ago and wasn’t impressed. The image was blurry.. The 3 fixes all the issues of the 2 and adds AR. AR could be a game changer. So many possibilities. Meta would be smart to discontinue the quests 2.
2024-03-30,That video pass through is worlds better than in the Quest 2! Impressive
2024-03-30,it improved with software updates
2024-10-31,That is a super obnoxious wrap on the Porsche but I love it
2024-06-03,"i’ve not been blown away with the quest 3 for sim racing on the pc.  Automobilista 2 is probably the benchmark in terms of best performance and clarity out of the quest 3.   Next best is F1 22 , iRacing and  RF2.  I have yet to get a playable setup for F1  23, Assetto Corsa Competizione and Le Mans Ultimate.  Just tired of mucking about with Oculus Debug Tool, SteamVR, Open Composite etc… trying to get the best visuals experience between the different sim racing games.  i have a 4090, 7800x3d and usb c 3.2 cable for my setup"
2024-11-30,"Compared to the ps5 pro the quest 3 and expecially the quest3s are really cheap. Price is no longer an excuse not to try it. I own a quest 1 and now quest 3 and if you have a decent computer for half life alyx, in addition to space pirate trainer and beatsaber on quest standalone, i recommend this headset. Its so much fun, even for groups. Nintendo is really sleeping here. The 3v1 mario party games and games like zelda botw should run easily on a nintendo25 and headset like this."
2025-01-29,$250 for a jacket is wild
2024-03-30,apparently everyone is taking these back because the controllers have a design flaw that constantly causes tracking to go haywire.
2024-03-30,"WOW I did not know PICO did not release the Pico 4 to NA yet.
I am rocking that headset for close to a year now and it is utterly amazing. Very light, very good graphics on PC (2160*2160 per eye) and for me very comfortable.

Wen comparision video Linus?"
2024-03-30,"Why is nobody talking about how Meta should remove the battery all together, this would make it soooo much lighter, I'd happily shred weight in exchange for external battery"
2024-03-30,7:35 OMG THIS WAS MY CHILDHOOD I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE VIDEO
2024-03-30,"Mannn I can never pull the trigger on these newer headsets. I have the original Oculus Quest CV1. It's functionally still great. Lately i've been moving it a lot between my living room and office and it has really made me seriously consider buying a quest for the first time. The idea of having no chords at all, or just 1 chord when connected to the PC is amazing. The worst part of the CV1 are those damn IR cameras so getting rid of those would be amazing. I just can't justify dropping this kind of cash when I already have a perfectly working headset. Maybe getting a cheap quest 2 for the living room is the move..."
2024-05-04,imagine leaving your 3d floating vr screen in the train
2024-03-30,"I started playing dungeons of eternity a few days ago, and it’s the best thing since sliced bread"
2024-03-30,I love Linus' porsche paintjob so much
2024-03-30,The headset was advertised for 120hz yet Quest Link and Air Link are still stuck at 90hz for the Quest 3. This is crazy as the Quest 2 supports 120hz for both. Don't buy if you are a PCVR user until meta fixes this
2024-03-30,"content isn't good enough for multiple adverts, $250 for a goofy Ah jacket lmaooo"
2024-03-30,I agree - the headstrap is fine for me too had no issue with it. My biggest complain is battery life which should have been 3 hrs. I find myself putting it on charge after every use.
2024-03-30,The mic is actually next to your nose on the gold charging things the one on the front is for noise canceling
2024-05-04,"Meta stock is actually doing great, it went from $90 - $500 right now in 2 years"
2024-03-30,"U can hold the ""home"" button to get your floating window back in center (if it's stuck somewhere)"
2024-03-30,"Adam looking like he is getting BIG, need to hit the beatsaber a little more"
2024-03-30,"Bro is looking CLEAN with that new shave, nice!"
2024-03-30,Okay so then I'm still happy that I got a Quest 2 on sale awhile back. Steam releasing their SteamVR link this was  amazing as well.
2024-10-31,I just sold my Quest 2 and I'm planning on getting the Quest 3.   I like the 110 FOV.  The FOV in the Quest 2 feels like a bit of tunnel vision.
2024-03-30,Hahaha 13:14 I had about the same tought but mine was: I cant imagine if it was a 2000$ instead of 600. Quality would be so damn great that i would sell all my screens.
2024-03-30,I plan on upgrading from the Rift S to the Quest 3 for Christmas :) I've been a very good boy this year
2024-03-30,You can easily hook it up with a powerbank with over 20wh charging capability and make the session last over 6-8 hours.
2024-03-30,"6:27 That's him officer, he wasn't using the Quest controller wrist strap"
2024-03-30,Yeah those front cameras are hit or miss for people. I've seen videos like this one here where it's perfectly clear while others like mine is almost unusable because it's so grainy and I have yet to find a way to fix it.
2024-07-03,"Constant wifi drops, Controller tracking issues, and artifacting in most games. Yeah, huge upgrade."
2024-03-30,"""I could clearly see the Zuck's vision"" (Simulated Lizard Vision) lol"
2024-03-30,"""My UI is stuck in the stairs."" The future's weird, man."
2025-01-29,Hi great video… loved the joke about the chair  … Yiu mentioned the battery life at 90 minutes.. but seriously who could possible wear this unit for that long!?! After 30 minutes I feel nauseated!!  Wearing something this close to the eyes couldn’t possibly be good for both your eyes and brain! Are there any known side effects? Perhaps too early to know! Time will tell but from my experience this cannot be good
2024-03-30,"Correction: Quest-hole - Something that guys want (for recreational ""use"" or breeding) but that a high-maintenance chick will make you *work* for. 
(*usually* WORK means ""EFFORT"" = TIME + MONEY but can sometimes be ""EFFORT"" x TIME x MONEY in worst case scenarios)"
2024-03-30,The quality of the video went up. This is how it should be.
2024-03-30,I wish people would talk about how they ended support for the Rift S almost immediately after releasing it and are now pulling features from it.
2024-03-30,I respect the very (at one point) questionable gamble the ZUCC took on vr. We are finally seeing the vision!
2024-03-30,"Solar panel, battery and backpack for real long term emersion.

Build a set for a holodeck type experience

Can these pick up other individuals in front of the camera and superimpose an avatar?"
2024-03-30,The weak link with this headset are the controllers.  Because they don't have cameras in them like the Pro controllers they can easily lose tracking in many apps.  Meta should have kept the halo's on them.  Next would be the under powered battery.  And once again Meta got the face pad wrong.  I don't understand why it's so difficult for them to make a good face pad.
2024-03-30,Loved this honest review! Thank you!
2024-03-30,"would recommend taking a look at virtual desktop, it allows for passthrough on both desktop mode and even while in game"
2024-03-30,"There's some weird sub-bass noise (HVAC?) in nearly all the ""interview"" sections like at 13:21"
2024-03-30,"Hopefully you can adjust hand tracking in the settings, don't wanna be doing one-handed VR and have a ghost fist keep popping into frame"
2024-03-30,The new price point for the Quest 2 looks really attractive now
2024-03-30,"I feel like its a pretty obvious observation, but Facebook is pretty clearly shifting more to the casual, office-having, PC-not-having kind of audience pretty strongly. And i mean, i cant complain, because that's where the money is because they've been shifting that way for quite a while anyway. What i thought was worth noticing is how fascinating that shift is, when theres also such a solid userbase in PCVR experiences. And i mean, yeah... this can still ""play"" them, but when they designed this thing, let's be real- it was not with ANY consideration to Quest Link's existence. They made a lot of small sacrifices with this headset in pursuit of grander things that are probably more considerable to the typical user, that almost completely don't apply to Quest Link and PCVR at all, with the exception of the FoV. PCVR players are some of the most devout I've ever seen, and spend a shit ton of time in games like VRChat when there aren't new releases for them to play with. And as a VRChat player myself, i KNOW how devout people are with that game, and i know that when you spend that much time in a PCVR game on something making sacrifices the way the Quest 3 does, well... I'll just say i expect to see the Quest 2 being called the most worthwhile, accessible VRChat headset- not the Quest 3."
2024-03-30,"psvr2 free from motion blur  LCD has always best OLED in being mostly blur and ghosting free...

And btw, Quest 2 is 2 hours or so until discharge too"
2024-03-30,"A product like this would do well with some sort of stationary, secondary lidar source.  Like how a surveyor would use a HUB set"

2024-03-30,"I like the controller loops, because they help with ADS in some FPS games."
2025-01-29,"I really wish Linus would do a video and some test on how to get 3- Blu-Rays to play on the PC. After 2020 Support vanished and was discontinued on PC. With the Quest and PC the only option we have is to download or RIP them. Apps like VUDU still allow purchasing and watching 3-D movies. 

It be nice if Linus and the team would do a video clearing up and experimenting with watching 3-D MOVIES Using the Queat 3. Without the need for ripping, downloading or pirating.

It would be ice to even dust off the old PS4 or PS3 and run it through a Capture Card and play it through Virtual Desktop or something.

I can't find any videos he actually watched Disney 3-D movies on the Apple Pro? 

With all the work he has done to make 3-d Movie Theatre room? 

I would have thought this would have been something he would have been excited about.

The Quest even offers a Laydown Mode in the experimental features...

There's so much to cover and share and with the lack of Support for Quest 3-D movies even Zuccerberg mentioned The Apple Pro is better...

So I really wish he would cover something to get me excited about this vix of 3-D blurays I have...."
2024-03-30,need to hear what you have to say about the Vision Pro ..
2024-11-30,I liked the controller rings. I smashed my hand into a wall once and the ring saved my thumb from an ouchie.
2024-03-30,"""just like the Zuck envisioned"" was the thumbs up moment for me"
2024-03-30,We've come a long way since the days of DK2
2025-02-28,I think the AR complaints during the cooking scene are not accurate tbh. I do it often and never have an issue
2024-03-30,"The best thing is that it's a stand-alone device, whereas the psvr 2 needs to be hooked to a console."
2024-03-30,"After watching this video, I don’t feel as bad spending what I spent for that 512gb set. Kids are going to love it. I got 2 and luckily they know how to share well . And removing the battery on the quest 3 controllers…… Nice."
2024-03-30,I feel like at this point some software tweaks and an affordable compact multi direction treadmill is all we need
2024-03-30,I used to have a Rift S and it was so outdated so then I got the Quest 3.
2024-03-30,"I can't help it, the Quest makes me think about a certain attachment used in a fairly well know cyberpunkish anime, where it's used as a hacking tool...That said, I have to wonder why all that tech needs to be in the googles and not in something like the size of your phone, which could then do the connection outward by wifi or cable. With only one wire that could hold the data needed to change your world. I mean we are usually carrying a phone around, so why not take advantage of that fact and replace the phone with better googles and a cpu/power brick instead of you phone.

We have tons of examples on how it could be done in cyberpunk type stories, scify stories with AR systems or animes and comics too for that matter. Authors world around has long imagined the visor that shows you an AR agumented world or full VR when needed. Done right good VR googles could replace the need for a phone, a pad and even to a degree a laptop and maybe even a home computer. Hell it could replace the need for external screens all together. 

Ops, but that might be a huge no in the earning situation for all those screen makers...and others."
2024-03-30,Main selling point - can you drink a cup of tea with the headset on? I really hated my CV1 for that as I had to take it off to take a sip.
2024-03-30,"""She might have been more impressed if I had done the dishes, but what are you gonna do?"" 

How about the dishes, bud?"
2024-03-30,"you should check the pico 4, its passthrough is incredible too"
2024-03-30,I have a battery pack and just put it in my hoodie with the cable that the quest comes with and it charges when I’m playing no problem adds an hour plus works if you already have a battery pack and don’t wanna buy a new strap
2024-03-30,Those jeans with that car is an insane flex
2024-03-30,Is the quest 3 worth it for someone who isn’t that interested in gaming. More interested in watching videos and doing work
2024-08-02,I have a Valve Index and a pico 4 and got 2 Quest 3 for me and my girlfriend. The small diffrences make it worth the upgrade.
2024-03-30,"We have the exact same ""door in door' LG refrigerator, sweet!!"
2024-03-30,It's their first good complete product. I really like mine too. Only thing about it thats crap is they should have made the battery separate. Battery life is really horrible and I want to play AR real world shooters.
2024-10-01,"Lmao the lizard eyes ""just like the zuck intended"" :P"
2024-03-30,"Don't worry mate, having a conversation with her while you're in VR is so far down the list. If she's put up with you this long, she's not going anywhere"

2024-03-30,"What about the 4th kind of headset buyer? The one that bought a headset a long time ago but didn't get a lot of use out of it because it wasn't very good and didn't have the features I want. Essentially, the barriers to use the thing have to be lowered and the number of use cases have to be increased. 
Really I just want an amazing AR headset that can let me game on it occasionally. But maybe I'm the only one in this mystical 4th category. I'm at the point that I'm beginning to believe I'm not even human anymore."
2024-03-30,Man's gotta be the only guy out there that looks older when he shaves his beard off.
2024-03-30,Even with LCD the motion clarity is in fact better than the PSVR 2.
2024-03-30,You can double tap to get back to Quest home when in Oculus home now on Quest 2

2024-03-30,The virtual workspace is almost what would sell me alone.  a 4k professional monitor is about the same amount of money as the meta 3.
2024-03-30,Linus!!!! where is the collab with SpectreSoundStudios!? We musicians are waiting for a super computer built exclusively for music creation!
2024-03-30,Linus the type to beat his wife
2024-03-30,I'm not sure if you know my question about to ask. I've been googling it and I cannot any information whatsoever. Would you buy? Would you happen to know if they are going to make a Meta Quest Pro???? I am wanting to purchase it said I don't want to do that and then months later the pro version comes out.
2024-03-30,"I do not agree. Hand tracking on the Quest 3 is great, and playing Half Life Alyx (thus PC VR) is breathtaking. The value for money is spot on!"
2024-08-02,how hyped are you about the apple vision pro now just a genuine question
2024-03-30,tech tips really shooting for that mr beast style video editing that gets the adhd zoomers
2024-03-30,"Pretty sure Meta does NOT plan on selling the Q2 alongside the 3 for very long (hence all the recent fire sales of it being $250 + $50 GC at the retailer of your choice just this past BF, including from Meta themselves). Rumors are in 2024 they will release a Q3 Lite that is supposed to replace it which would ultimately phase the Q2 out. Of course that doesn't diminish its insanely good price point for what it is. Q3 is a nice upgrade though, they're finally moving in the right direction with usable AR/MR support."
2024-03-30,"Thank you very much :) but you missed something important: VR Video Playback tests. So what are the limits in resolution, bitrate etc. for the new AV1 codec e.g. when playing stereoscopic 8K 360° videos (e.g. in skybox)"
2024-03-30,"i definitely see a future where people don't need physical monitors anymore, or huge TVs. The quest 3 is literally about as close as you can get to the brink of truly viable VR....but still ever so slightly off.  Software is also still lacking refined complexity. The best games are still very classic arcade-like in their mechanics. 

I adore flight simulation and cars. Once the hardware gets to a solid 8k w/120-140 FOV I will fully dive into VR. But for now....my Quest 2 mostly sits in a drawer because its still so much easier to just play a good 2d game after that 2-3 month VR high."
2024-12-30,pretty crazy that you did 1 sponsor and 2 store plugs within 6 minutes
2024-03-30,"What I learned from this video: It'll probably take one or two more releases before I get into VR, seems almost there, but still some major things need improved"
2024-12-30,Can you do the Vision Pro next???
2024-03-30,"I absolutely love the quest 3 its comfortable, good tech, great content, and is priced reasonably"
2024-03-30,"I'm highly considering upgrading from my OG Vive to this. I can't believe it costs almost a third of what I paid for the Vive in 2016 while being such a great headset. Although it sounds like the tracking won't be as good as Vive base stations, I find that it's worth the sacrifice since I hate setting up the Vive. it takes so long to plug everything in on the Vive so I play it a lot less since I need a huge time slot to commit. With this, I can jump in and out much quicker. I hear the ""pancake"" lenses are much better than the ""fresnel"" lenses as well, ontop of the fact that the OG Vive is such a low resolution I can see a screen door at all times. I'm going to still keep my Vive since it's probably not worth much these days anyways, but the Quest 3 is definitely going to be my next big purchase. I can't believe I actually want one of Zucc's products lol"

2024-03-30,I recommend a halo type headstrap for Mixed Reality. And a battery...bobovr M3 fixes every issue
2024-03-30,5 sponsors / plugs in 15 minutes
2024-03-30,"Tracking, and the sound... is why i still use CV1, i have a Valve Index... but the kids can use that. That's not for me."
2024-03-30,they should have given the quest 3 those pro controller sensors with having to pay $500+
2024-03-30,"Dude ... buddy ... why that color? Did you install some RGB LEDs also?

Mine is silver ... but it's a VW UP! ..."
2024-03-30,"i think LCD is better for this type of headsets, cus LED screens burn very quick, and most of ppl that buy this headsets are VRChat players and they spend a ton of hours in vr trust me."
2024-03-30,You can summon the UI right infront of you by holding the meta button.
2024-03-30,"Ive been debating buying a quest 3 for a few months, just fo the AR.  I think I'll wait a bit longer after watching this video."

2024-03-30,"""what are you gonna do"", idk linus, the dishes maybe?"
2024-03-30,I am snob when it comes to speakers but I think they sound great! The mic is what is pretty meh about it. It works fine though.
2024-03-30,"Linus dial back the ltt product placement, it’s getting out of hand. Just make a small section listing them all and be done with it."
2024-07-03,"What is the recommended buy for a Quest 1 user who now cannot even party chat with his friends that live 6+ hours away, but has 4 kids, mortgage and single income and lives in Australia."
2024-03-30,Absolutely! Quest 3 is the best available at it price point.
2024-03-30,"Buy the BOBO with 1 extra battery, like most do. No limit to how long you can play."
2024-03-30,why is the crab rave your audio benchmark? lol
2024-03-30,why don't they make it wired to a wearable pc and do all the computing with it and have the battery outside of the headset itself??? Big headsets and connecting to a stationary pc with a cable seems like a bad idea. Also a transparent screen for a passthrough seems like a better choice for passthrough than rendering everything
2025-01-29,"Lol, it really says something about my audio setup thinking the quest 2 and 3 sound really good to me. I guess dollar store headphones arent that great."
2024-03-30,I'm excited to see you guys trying the Pico 4. Coming from a WMR from HP it's night and day. Specially the very good inside out tracking and the pancake lenses that feel like an orgasm to the eyes :D
2024-05-04,I think its the next model that will be a breakthrough device...the quest 3 is confirmation that they will achieve what they are setting out to do
2024-03-30,I hope you reviewed this properly.  I heard your ability to do so is somewhat in question.
2024-03-30,"Come on, Valve. Give us a wired, 1440p, 144hz headset and you can take all my money"
2024-03-30,"I bought one. It is really good. But after getting sick once and doing all the great demos, I had no want to go back to it. I sold it for what I paid after three weeks. Maybe I'm not the target for 3d glasses. The tech is great, but not for me."
2024-03-30,Props to having the Conan Clip in your tabs!
2024-03-30,"""The absolute INCREDIBLE pass through"" - well yes, compared to the abysmal quest 2 pass-thru but nothing incredible as far as life-like video, or what is possible in theory.  It is adequate for many things but only makes me yearn for better pass-through video; which is probably the point; make back some of that 47 Billion!   Which still seems very much too high for just research, even given those concept headsets they have made that are indeed very impressive, retaining and grabbing the right engineers, etc.  Witness how unimpressive the legless avatars, the UI, battery life, and comfort still is.  Granted, it is a significant step and might even be finally the game changer we have been waiting for, but sadly we have to put up with Meta dropping the ball on basic stuff."
2024-12-30,I bought Quest 3 128GB refurb for $380. No brainer. I don't use standalone much so the 128GB should be adequate.
2024-03-30,That skin on the taycan looks sick
2024-03-30,The problem is the SOFTWARE not the VR units. But they're getting there.
2024-03-30,"Lower your expectations on Video passthrough..
Video passthrough isn't that much incredible in the sense that it look like a cheap camera with little granny moving pixel. Look less worst in a very very light environnement, but the majority of the time, you don't have the best light as a studio got.

That being said, i got the quest 3 and it's a very nice headset. As Linus said, ""we can start to see the Marc Zuk vision"".

I try to do some programming on a Mac and the detail quality is good enough to be able to program 2 hours easy without problem. That's crazy and i just think that vision pro will be really crazy on that if it become accessible one day.

In 3 years, VR it will be!"
2024-03-30,I still think they should be making full helmets rather than these goofy goggles....Imagine a Judge Dredd or Iron Man style VR/AR helmet!
2024-03-30,5:06 I thought you were going to say that our jackets aren't warm enough for anything colder than 32 degrees Fahrenheit.
2024-03-30,Was low key waiting for this review for my final decision
2024-03-30,"I'm very interested in jumping into VR/AR now that quality is this good at this price. I've still yet to have my own headset, and only experienced the PSVR1 a few times with beatsaber and that's it. Is the Quest 3 a good jumping on point, or would I be better off waiting or possibly just getting the lower end Quest 2? Are there any significant compatibility issues with meta headsets? Like do I have to jump through hoops to get a Quest to work with steam games or anything I want to watch videos on etc? Or is it apple-esque where I'm going to be pretty locked down to only apps and app stores that Meta allows without some workarounds/jailbreaking?"

2024-08-02,its like theres a real chair oh theires acturally a chair was funny and underrated
2024-03-30,I'd have loved for you to talk about the privacy concerns of requiring a Meta account to use it.
2024-03-30,Bought quest2 straight after the release as soon it was easily available. Probably whole last year it is just sitting and collecting dust.
2024-03-30,LOVING my Quest 3. Huge upgrade from the Quest 2. Battery is terrible. But the battery head strap from Kiwi Design gives you way more. And if I’m working in it I just plug in cause I’m not moving much. Highly recommend. (Afraid to try an OLED headset though. I’d rather not know what I’m missing )
2024-03-30,I liked this tech this seems pretty handy in coming years
2024-03-30,"This took forever to become a thing.
Augmented reality is such an obvious option for these things, it's like they dont even have the creativity to come with new things."
2024-09-01,"I dunno. I checked out the metaverse and there were some concert things. I don't even know who Samantha Carpenter is but seeing her in VR right in front of me and I can walk around the stage was really neat. I actually enjoyed the experience. I don't like concerts or people so it's perfect for me. I can see why people are averse (get it, metaverse, averse, huh, yea, no). VR can be exclusive, hard to get friends together unless they are enthusiasts which is rare bc people are lazy af."
2024-03-30,change those sidemarkers on the tycan the euro ones are so much nicer.
2024-03-30,My qustion is if they will allow custom lenses for those with glases
2025-02-28,"Quest 3 great headset but they have a weird issue with the payment systems and I had to return my headset as I couldn’t even buy any software. Tried customer support, still waiting for a resolution. Not great"
2024-03-30,"if ur totally new to vr, u should get a pico 4 instead of a quest 2. But if u know u definately like VR, get a quest 3"
2025-01-29,"Meta is a crap company. They sent my headset to the entirely wrong city, didn’t tell me they did so until after it arrived, and refused to correct anything. I had to drive 80 miles on Christmas morning to pick it up off the porch of a vacant house inside a gated community. A month later and they’re still refusing to take responsibility for their mistake."
2024-10-31,r u gonna review the meta quest 3s
2024-03-30,Stand alone is what really sells the meta quest
2024-03-30,"hope this time playing with it plugged will NOT drain the battery, because with quest2, plugged to PC, while gaming battery is STILL draining thus limiting to around 2 or 3h of game session before the quest turning off"
2024-03-30,the price for that jacket is a little insane tho. Love the quest 3 ! especially for PCVR
2024-03-30,"I am worried they didn't mention the grainy real use pass through quality, making me further worried it really is a ""bad batch"" thing."
2024-10-31,I could understand why pass-through is blurry in lower lighting but all my screens and games are blurry as well. I only need glasses for reading.  I just don’t understand why everything is so blurry.
2024-03-30,Vr still seems like a gimmick that is not ready for mass use. However it does seem a lot more mature than  it did a few years back.
2024-03-30,they should have a UI follow feature where it follows you when you switch it to that mode and stationary if you don't want it to follow you around.
2024-03-30,I'd love it but I think I'm still going to wait to get a headset. I'd like to get the next generation of the Index whenever it releases as accurate hand tracking is my biggest complaint along with quality immersive games for VR at the moment.
2024-03-30,Crunch upload schedule is BACK
2024-03-30,"""Simulated Lizard Vision."" 

Please try not to state such things when I'm in the middle of swallowing some fluids and I consequently nearly choke to death..."
2024-11-30,"If the Quest 3 only got Displayport 

Or could please Quest 3 and Crystal Light make some babys?"
2024-03-30,face raider's was a great game
2024-03-30,"I can't help but notice the frequency of your uploads again. No noticeable error or discrepancies so far but I'm afraid, if this continues, there might be another ""channel break"" again."
2024-03-30,How good is the steam vr experience. I would like to buy this and then just use it like its a pcvr headset.
2024-03-30,Liking mine so far..... Mostly Sim race... But every mod i have also runs great too... Every Res evil VR Mod.... Alyx...Asset Cors...etc
2024-03-30,"Don't bother with the Pico. It immediately made me motion sick, something that the Quest did not do to me."
2024-03-30,It's crazy the consoles launch with new titles and the quest has no games/software really backing it up beside vr chat which works on any headset...
2024-03-30,Are you still mandatory to login to Facebook account in order to used it?
2024-03-30,The guy from Serial experiments lain is coming to life.
2024-03-30,"Loved this review/critic, but I can't wonder who is that new baby-shaved looking employee that showed up around 7:00?"
2024-03-30,"Nothing will ever get me to trust an internet-connected Meta hardware, especially not anything with cameras."
2024-03-30,"How the HELL is your passthrough so clear?!?! My passthrough, while I can totally tell what's around me, looks like absolute swamp water compared to the footage in this video..."
2024-05-04,"The reptilian Zuckerberg  eyes at the end, nice touch lol!"
2024-03-30,"We're still in the ""weird and bulky"" phase of VR. Needs 10-15 more years at least."
2024-03-30,Huh. I think I finally have an option worth upgrading my OG Vive for.
2024-03-30,I laughed at the microwave gag
2024-03-30,I find the battery life estimate to be cap (a lie). I was able to pull out over 3 hours of playtime in just VR and still had 40% left.
2024-03-30,Have only played the quest 3 since October. Have no plans on touching my PS5 until February.
2024-03-30,Excellent. Wake me up when Quest 4 arrives.
2024-03-30,"Im still waiting for ""the next big thing"" when it comes to VR. It seems like there are tons of VR headsets out there that are all tackling 1 of the many problems I have with VR. 

Some headsets give you really wide FOVs, some do their best to make the image as clear and not blurry as possible, some are very small and light weight, some have really good external cameras/ AR capabilities, etc etc. But very few are trying to make a headset that tries to fix all those problems at the same time. And for me even when one of those issues is present it completely ruins my experience and turns it from a ""wow I could do this for hours every day!"" to a gimmick thats fun for maybe an hour or 2 a week."
2024-03-30,0:45 oka you cant expect me to believe that LINUS caught them on the 1st try
2024-03-30,You should have added a scream of pain in the background @7:10
2024-10-31,Should make total war vr  that would be an  amazing concept.
2024-03-30,This was an incredibly well edited video.
2024-06-03,At what price point would you recommend getting the Meta Quest 3 instead of the 2 or waiting for the rumored Meta Quest Lite/3s?
2024-03-30,Linus seems to really love Crab Rave.
2024-03-30,Zenni optical is making prescription lenses specifically for the Q3
2024-03-30,hurts you see you use the headset in the open sun in that intro lol
2024-03-30,But the mura of the OLED on PSVR2 was horrendous (tried 3 different PSVR2 headsets all the same). Returned it and bought the OG Vive Pro- no such issue. Love my Quest 3 (and Vive Pro for HLA)
2024-03-30,i can imagine this is not good for the eyes over a long period of use. Isnt it like watching the tv close up? I have one but rarely play it anymore
2024-03-30,Double tap the side of the headset while you're in Quest Link for passthrough.
2024-05-04,Think I might get the pro controllers if the controllers still track themselves on the quest 3.
2025-01-29,Its a Sam's Choice Premium cut at the moment
2024-05-04,Try out Citra VR and do what nintendont delivers with the 3ds ;) enjoy a great gaming session with 3d
2024-03-30,"So still the same problems as the quest 2. It feels pretty amazing for a first time user.... for the first few hours or so. Once you get used to it and the wow factor wears off the downsides just keep piling up and make it nothing but a headache to use. ""Cheap"" VR is still not there yet imo.

It's also hardly a big upgrade considering it's $200 more than the original msrp of the quest 2 (which is what i got mine at)"
2024-03-30,if you already have a quest 2 then wait for the quest 4 as i feel like the quest 3s more of a prototype to what to come for the next quest
2024-03-30,"VR is definitely not ready, good review"
2024-03-30,Ahahah I appreciate the call out to You Suck At Cooking. What an excellent channel!
2024-03-30,hmm... lemme know when they get the AR/VR contacts ... like the one used in MI by Tom Cruise.
2024-03-30,Simulated Lizard Vision. Now that's predictive programming right there
2024-07-03,"I'm surprised at how inside out vs outside in tracing is portrayed here. I much prefer the inside out tracking on the Quest 3. I've had no issues with it and find it less janky than inside out, which needed 4 units to track you without losing sight of you if you turned around and would break (and require recalibration) if any of the beacons got moved slightly. It took up a lot of space and was fragile and I don't miss it."
2024-03-30,"Speaking of pc vr, there's steam link in the app store and makes an easy setup"
2024-03-30,"I still recommend the quest 2 for first timers and kids. At $250 you are just getting a lot for your money and I don't feel the quest 3 is worth over double the price. Is it better, for sure... But is it 2.5x plus better? No."
2024-03-30,"I love my quest 2 and think a 3 would be a great upgrade but they lost me on the price. I’m hoping to catch a sale some point down the line, which I feel worn be long seeing how they’re currently selling."
2024-03-30,Can you use this thing at night so it makes night as bright as day ?
2024-03-30,"Honestly, if there were more Half-Life Alyx like games I would maybe considering upgrading. However, there just aren't enough games that I would actually enjoy."
2024-07-03,Quest 1 batteries were easier to remove compared to the 3
2024-09-01,In my country that silicone interface costs $100
2024-03-30,"Would it be a good idea to get the Quest 2, just to watch movies?
I’m not really interest in the rest but I think it would be nice to watch movies on a large screen without need the space for a large TV or projector."
2024-03-30,"People already suffering headphone skull deformity, imagine what's going to happen with vr headsets of worn long term."
2024-03-30,"i've followed this channel since the beginning, and i didn't know how to spell ""segue"" until just now.... LOL"
2024-03-30,12:38 saving what?
2024-03-30,But does it have augmented reality yu gi oh ?  Does it allow us to scan our current card collection to be op. Does it allow it to be used with other decks like magic or.. i digress . Ai is here where is this
2024-03-30,I think we are on the right track but still a couple years away and even then... VR gives me headaches. So I don't know that I want this at all. I love the idea but I don't see it for me
2024-03-30,"Love my quest 3 with wifi 6e AP i have i can play games over airlink in my living room with my gaming rig in my office rack, no latency issues!!!"
2024-03-30,"They make precription lenses for them , the main problem i had with headset ."
2024-03-30,how is no one mentioning how hilarious simulated lizard vision is?
2024-03-30,Zuck and Linus should be friends.
2024-03-30,Controllers with removable batteries should be the norm
2024-03-30,I grabbed a quest 2 on EBay for $150.  Not terrible for cheap entry into VR.
2024-03-30,Zuck should pay a big DJ to do a set on the virtual decks lol
2024-03-30,"In my experience quest 2s dont last a year of regular use before they stop working properly, so I couldn't recommend a used one. I've had most of the oculus headsets since the 1st dev kit and an index with no issue. I get the impression they aren't optimized well for humidity considering its a gaming computer you strap to your face to play beatsaber."
2024-03-30,I cant wait to get one after Christmas need it asap
2024-03-30,"Thank you after watchin this review i decided to not buy it, was confused between quest 3 and steam deck, i'll just get myself a steamdeck"
2024-05-04,"So, how do you turn off the Foveated Rendering??  I would love that.."
2024-03-30,"I compared A/B between my Index and Quest 3, and Quest is a much better experience for PCVR. Selling my Index."
2024-03-30,"For ages you've been moaning about the Quest 2's battery cover, but my cover has never fallen off. I fact, the last time I tried to replace the batteries I couldn't get it to open and took me about 20 mins! I thought I was going mad, but eventually got it to open with a knife! So what's the deal with your headset? Is it possible you simply have faulty controllers?"
2024-03-30,"I saw this video a few hours ago

I comment 16 hours after upload, because the quest 3 is 16 cool, if you know, you know."
2024-12-30,Whats the game/expirience at 4:49 ?
2024-07-03,my biggest problem with the quest 2 was that the lens werent very adjustable it only had 3 settings
2024-03-30,Some great Applab games are Metacity Patrol and Battleglide
2024-03-30,4:19 nice editing touch
2024-03-30,Buying my quest 3 today !!!! I cant wait i LOVE VR
2024-03-30,Did they ever fix the issue of the battery draining even while doing PCVR over link cables?
2024-03-30,I've been wanting to get into VR for ages but honestly I think I'll wait for Valve's next gen VR headset and hope they dont require base stations.
2024-03-30,The pass-through video needs to improve. Maybe that is Apple's planned secret sauce as I'd be inclined to leave it off if it isn't perfect.
2024-03-30,They should add those bladeless fans in this.
2024-03-30,2:24 how though? Can't find that setting anywhere. It's also doing it when playing pcvr
2024-03-30,i don't have quest 3 and im sure someone has already said this... but that the video doesn't follow you and you have to drag it with yourself is good feature... cuz at points you would find yourself thinking why this thing follows me??!! i might be saying this out of nowhere but considering your job and multitasking i would say it makes sense.
2024-03-30,Ludacris pricing when you sell a $10 screwdriver for $70. LOL
2024-03-30,Can we please get more Anthony. And maybe a linux channel?
2024-03-30,I haven't been here in so long.. last time I saw linus's car it was spray painted
2024-03-30,"If one already have a PS5 would you recommend PSVR 2 over the Quest 3? I currently own the Quest 2, but I like the idea of getting a VR headset capable of 4K at some point."
2024-03-30,I can't wait to get one! It's sadly going to be a while... :(
2024-03-30,Ok how many takes did you need to toss the controllers?
2024-03-30,TWO vr videos in a week i think christmas came earlier
2024-03-30,What was the game you were playing at 4:49?
2024-03-30,@LinusTechTips please cover the Plex “weekly review” feature in WAN show.
2024-03-30,Oh man I think I might need to get the quest 3. Iv never tried vr before and my computer is just an ok gaming pc. This might work for me
2024-03-30,Tried the quest 2 and noticed a nose gap letting in light. I heard the quest 3 might fix that
2024-06-03,Soon as they drop the price they always do it’s gonna sky rocket. Right now only hardcore people are upgrading. Still. All these months later. Nobody I know that is just a normal casual VR user is dropping 600 bucks.
2024-03-30,"Honestly, I'm still wondering if I should get a quest 3, considering I had a quest 2 (with lots of controller issues) but I might just get  a PSVR2, since I have a PS5, and I know it will have SO MUCH more performance"
2024-07-03,All this thing really needed was eye tracking. Hopefully the Q4 has something similar when it drops.
2024-10-31,Is it better than an oculus rifts?
2024-05-04,I really want a one but my parents say they don’t want to get it because mainly of the face tracking and they say that it probably takes data from us even though it probably doesn’t.
2024-03-30,This is my favorite Linus segue ever.  All you need is a bed.  LOL!
2025-03-09,A year later... should i still buy this one or is there alreaedy a better one out?
2024-03-30,"There’s still a long way to go, and hopefully there are a lot more games soon for it soon."
3  ago,"Sort of over this headset. Too front heavy, terrible FOV, bad battery life, low quality mobile games, etc. They need to stop trying to cram so much tech into the front of these units. Give us an external battery that also handles all of the processing power so the form factor can be more similar to the Big Screen Beyond 2."
2024-03-30,"I just want a cheap masterbastion device. Please send me recommendations in the replies. I mean, what's that behind you!"
2024-03-30,I have an OG Vive with the wireless adapter. Been thinking about getting the Quest 3. Is it worth it?
2024-05-04,"So digital foundry says the motion clarity is second to none on the quest 3, and your saying the psvr2 with the oled has better motion quality (what I thought too)"
2024-03-30,what sucks doe is that they dont update or care about their products. They only farm money from them. For example if you want the full game of beatsaber then you need to pay around 900$ for it. Its absurd.
2024-03-30,Stand alone head set will only be the only one no more cords
2024-03-30,Do you need to sign into Facebook with this? It wasn't mentioned in the video.
2024-03-30,I wanna buy a vr headset and i have a really good gaming pc so i can use pcvr too but im very confused if i should buy quest 2 or quest 3
2024-03-30,Hope this whole thing doesn't end up becoming the tech dystopia we've all been fearing......
2024-03-30,"Sorry I hate the 20 min take off and refresh big bulky headsets.  If they were smaller less of a pain on long use, i'd be day one.  Maybe someday."
2024-05-04,"If you wanna drink with the Quest 3, I suggest a Tommy Tippy cup, or similar!"
2024-03-30,"why nobody is talking about how passthrough is still bad. It requires lots of lights and even with light, its like putting a vintage filter on"
2025-02-28,"Using wireless link, if left on dynamic mine was choppy.  But fixing the bandwidth it ran perfectly (Was worried for a second but its fine on fixed)"
2024-03-30,try Drop Dead Cabin and Trill of the Fight. Amazing in MR.
2024-03-30,I was just about to comment that your screwdrivers cost more than 20 entire sets that I can purchase right here combined. But than you did it yourself.
2024-03-30,We're getting close to Augma - Sword Art Online
2024-09-01,"The fact they didn’t move the processing unit to a back pack drives me crazy… DO NOT PUT THE CPU ON THE HEADSET WHERE WEIGHT MATTERS….

No don’t hire me."
2024-03-30,Second hand device that someone was putting on sweaty face... Great idea.
2024-03-30,Wait how much is the jacket? Is that a typo?
2024-03-30,"Autotranslate of the title by google is strange, in Spanish it reads as a Porno: ""ahora soy un agujero de búsqueda""  
If you use AMD and see a bug on the right corner when using Airlink (distortion) modify the resolution setting with the devtool and set the encode resolution to 3712, that fixed it for me with a 7800XT."
2024-03-30,"this is really good but i recommend grabbing a pico 4. almost as good, but alot cheaper"
2024-03-30,"The passthrough is not incredible. I'm sorry. That's just not the case for a lot of us. It's extremely grainy. Even when adding more light. 

For some reason, some are good and others aren't."
2024-03-30,"All I wanted was a Q2 but better tbh. And I feel like I got it. 

I do wish the Q3 had more day 1 exclusives."
2025-01-29,"Dedicated WIFI 7 router and Virtual Desktop for SteamVR...no lag, high rez, no wires. Better than airlink"
2024-03-30,I use a hook on my ceeling for the link cable so it’s out the way completely
2024-03-30,"I don't think that you should place your smartphone at your face more than 2 hrs a day, nor do that more than 3 times a week :v"
2024-03-30,Any thoughts on whether the 512GB is needed instead of the 128GB?
2024-03-30,"So it still has a lomg way to go... 

I can think of ways to improve battery life and the lack of games/apps ,but they can do whatever they want"
2025-02-28,Can you plug it into power so you don’t have to worry about the battery?
2024-03-30,"My dude is chastising (albeit jokingly somewhat) about meta’s pricing, while also advertising a $200 hoodie"
2024-03-30,The spanish translation of the title is so wrong and dirty in so many levels
2024-03-30,This is cool and everything but if the in-person quality of the simulated world is anything like in this video then I can see why the battery life is only 2 hours and some change. Because if I had to spend more then an hour looking at CRT quality graphics then I'd quickly become nauseous.
2024-10-31,What is is that comparison between the PCVR Big Screen Beyond and the Quest the beyond wasn't even powered on nor does it have a camera at all
2024-03-30,I can’t wait to move into the pod and eat the bugs.
2024-03-30,"i exclusively use my quest 2 for PC VR Gaming, in that case, other than the AR that i will never use, is there any upgrades for PC gaming?"
2024-03-30,The question is still why would anyone want this? There is no practical use case for most people
2024-03-30,"9:55 this is not true at all, you can just double tap the side of the headset in order to enable passthrough?"
2024-03-30,Is this or big screen beyond better?
2024-03-30,banger vid buds. Are we gonna get the facial hair back or…?
2024-03-30,Ayo why is duke Dennis Rizzing me up with the meta quest 3 on his bum cheeks
2024-03-30,"Dont agree with not buying the Quest 2 new
£250 with £50 store credit. (Well was whilst the Black Friday Sales)
Then I also got a friend to do a referral, so both he and I got an extra £23 in store credit.
So technically I got the Quest 2 new for £177

On ebay, at least in the UK, people are asking that price for a used Quest 2!
Some are even trying to just sell the headset at that price, either only one, broken, or no controllers at all!

So £177 for a brand new Quest 2 with warranty. Not bad if you ask me."
2024-03-30,"How about rift S i have, should i just go and buy quest 3 ?"
2024-03-30,You should try the varjo xr-4 or xr-3
2024-11-30,now there is steam link so say goodbye to that cable you needed 3:05  XD
2024-03-30,"I just don't think its worth upgrading from quest 2 atm. I mostly use it for pcvr so im going to wait till the price drops, by a lot."
2024-03-30,Can’t wait for Apple to just  on all these headsets
2024-03-30,Interested in an update since SteamLink is it now
2024-03-30,nah I want a vr room
2024-03-30,"I have the original vive and have barely any money for computer stuff anymore, what should i get ?"
2024-03-30,Quest 3 looks insane. Waiting for mine.
2024-03-30,The meta quest 2 is like the iphone 15 while the quest 3 is like the 15 pro
2024-10-31,Are there unions in virtual reality?
2024-03-30,the quest 3 is incredible for racing simulations and oculus link being bad can be replaced with virtual desktop for a worthwhile 20$
2024-03-30,This is much more useful than complete immersion
2024-03-30,"I just want to lie in bed and watch tv series with my eyes without moving my head. Quest 2 is blurry except straight ahead. Does quest 3 fix this problem, or do you still need to move your head around to focus on different parts of the screen?"
2024-03-30,You are seriously charging $250 for a JACKET??? Insane...
2024-03-30,"Man, is valve ever going to compete with the quest line?"
2024-05-04,"So... This or the last headset you reviewed in ""I'm finally excited about vr again"""
2024-09-01,The apple vision pro is 5000$? That cuts out more than half of the vr community
2024-03-30,"This is still not good enough for average people yet, mainly for reviewers techies & kids device,  informative video"
2024-03-30,Still using my beat down rift s. I'm considering this one.
2024-03-30,"Who was thay handsome, clean-shaved, devil?"
2024-03-30,the lizard eyes at the end LOLLOOLLLLLLL
2024-03-30,I just got a quest 2 with no accessories for 130 cad. Was it worth it? I bought a strap with battery for it and prescription lens so i can see.
2024-03-30,Did occur to anyone yet that the 3ds  and meta 2 “3d” are dam near the same the 3ds like the quest also shows your eyes two different images although I’m sure you already knew that
2024-03-30,"I have no idea how anyone has issues with the quest 2 battery covers, never had it fall off. also the lack of up viewing cameras don't give me a good feeling."
2024-03-30,"So basically, VR still isn't anything other than a glorified beatsaber display. ""It's ok but it could be better"" doesn't convince me to spend a ton of money on something niche."
2024-03-30,Who the hell is the guy at 7:00 ? He looks somehow familiar...
2024-03-30,great editing!
2024-03-30,quest 3 is cool but would still would rather wait a few years to get a quest 4 or 5
2024-03-30,I'm hoping the wavy video from the real world is an artifact from recording?
2024-03-30,"got my quest 2 a few years ago for 300 dollars, kinda upset this is more expensive on release."
2024-03-30,and now that Meta signed with steam to be able to use steam link with Quest visors? what do you think about it? is it worth to use it stand alone and with pc for the steam library?
2024-03-30,its like beta version of vision pro ;D
2024-03-30,watching this in my quest 3 rn
2024-06-03,"""waiting for the bigscreen beyond""
Waiting for $500 to fall from the sky?"
2024-03-30,0:31 They are selling it at a loss. In hopes that people will be stuck with the brand going forward.
2024-03-30,"Wait, didnt Linus say he wouldnt buy a TayCan?
Since when the 180?"
2024-03-30,How much should one pay for a brand new Quest 2 128gb? Asking for a friend
2024-10-31,Detachable batteries used to be a thing... why can't we swap batteries and quick resume
2024-03-30,3:04 Who is this man with the star trek tattoo???!!!!
2024-03-30,Why would someone have cc cams inside their house?
2024-03-30,The microwave bit
2024-03-30,Immediately throw out the default headstrap or its going to ruin your experience within minutes.

so yeah Quest 3, I can read text now. and it was $167 off because I work at walmart and got 25% off for working black friday and went for the 512 gig version"

2024-03-30,As interesting as the Meta Quest products are. I'm still inclined to try to the Vision Pro though it will be years before I get one. I still want an iPhone 15.

2024-03-30,dang was hoping to see steam link performance from him
2024-03-30,Linus I need a debate why doesn’t oculus support Intel or vise versa like I’m kinda upset
2024-05-04,Quest 3 is quite good and for me you pointed the 2 major negative points. The points of pressure on the face with the vanilla cushion and the prices of accessories that you need very fast... 1) A good head band. 2) A PC Link USB cable 3) An extra Battery. 4) A good Software to read your videos (3D blu-ray). 5) A good wifi router 6) headset or ear plugs. and so on

2024-03-30,"Well... From 'home user'  standpoint it all started with oculus rift so it was 13 years to get up to this point(and it is still just a big and bulky 'toy' with meeh factor) I think it would be another 13 to 15 years until finally 'VR' in hardware and software will mature enough that will be practical to use in daily life- just like companies for he last decade are hyping every year in their beautiful demo scenarios and ads. But its all still very far from truth when it comes to every day life...

Until then it's a expensive(but fun) toy with many inconveniences.  Maybe in 2035 i will finally want to own one because it will improve quality of life!"

Never have to purchase another monitor again, just make as many or as big of monitors in AR and play games on that. Now that is probably a bit far off too (good gaming experiences on AR monitors), but damn that would clean up so many desk spaces."

i wish that they had a good steamvr  web browser  that allows the immersion view.  there's a few  'browsers'  set to only work with their designed apps/pages. but so far nothing for say a good immersion vr experience for youtube  vr 180/360 views.  it won't ask to switch in, best you can do is control the view inside a floating window.  interesting in a different way.   
nothing comes close to using  the quest 3 apps, its own say firefox browser which isn't supported anymore or youtubevr..  pcvr is left behind : (   

still untapped market for a good web browser or extension to enable the immersion view upon request.   all the modern browsers turned their back on it."
2024-09-01,"My problem with this headset is:
I am a PCVR user. I don't have an overpowered PC so I can play stardew valley........ y'know?
That said, when I'm in the market for a VR, I want it to handle PCVR and anything beyond that is plain unnecessary and will never get used by someone like me.
This means the battery pack, the CPUs, the everything is all a waste of money.
Why can't we go back and revisit PCVR exclusively? Headsets could be lighter, cheaper, and you can actually get away with higher specs at the cost of not having all that extra unnecessary stuff also built in.
That's just my view point, personally, as I own a quest 2 and NEVER use it as a quest. It is exclusively just a wireless PCVR headset, except that because of quest link, barely even works half the time. I had to go buy external, aftermarket software, VirtualDesktop, to get a reliable connection. It's whack that I have to do that though when Quest Link is an advertised feature. It just simply doesn't fucking work half the time and I even went so far as getting a dedicated higher-end router specifically to host my quest's connection to PC.
That's insane to me.
Wireless is cool, I guess, but it just simply doesn't make up for all the issues I have with quest link software, plus, even wired it has the exact same connection issues.

It gets EVEN WORSE when you consider that I run a rx 7900xt GPU, WHICH to those of you that don't know, is not even SLIGHTLY supported by Quest Link, so since upgrading my GPU I've been unable to use the quest link AT ALL, let alone as unreliably as before with an rtx 3090.
It's completely assinine.

I don't care how good this headset is, Meta will not get anymore of my money as they have spat on me as a customer just about every chance they've gotten. I've never felt more ripped off by a supposedly professional corporation. I'd expect this kind of behavior out of some cheap china knock off scam service or something....... but not Meta. 

Even before all that, the performance of Quest link straight up sucked.

It bothers me that you're giving this thing so much credit, Linus. As my entire experience with the quest 2 made me just feel ripped off so bad that I don't even want to give the pro or the 3 a chance.. because my problem was never with the headset or hardware, but with the software and Meta themself.

This is obnoxiously long for a youtube comment, but I have strong opinions on these products.

I'm soon going to purchase an Index, but I've been patiently waiting to see if something new/better would come out first............ It fucking sucks that the index, from yeaaaaars ago, is still the leading PCVR headset. This has GOT to change soon. That, or they need to drop it's price from $1000, because it's getting straight up out-classed at this point by $400 headsets that are even MOBILE.

I just want PCVR....... is that so much to ask for?"
2024-03-30,would my pascription lenses from the quest 2 work with the quest 3?
2024-03-30,End segue was a 10/10
2024-03-30,"OLED displays are a completely bad pick and I'm glad they're still not going for them, they eventually come with image burn-in at random, always. Even my freaking samsung galaxy watch 4 has that, organic displays are a dumb choice unless you want to change them every 1-5 years and I'm not taking apart a Quest headset to change the displays thank you very much, ""clarity"" is not worth it if the image gets burned-in for just being used for its intended purpose"
2024-03-30,"""Quest Hole?  Did he mean, ""Quest Hoe?""  (chuckles) ... Hey guys!  I didn't lose any money while NOT buying the Quest 3.

2024-03-30,"Haven't tried the Quest 3, but from all the reviews I have seen I think that this product also made me more hyped about Apple Vision Pro. With it I could basically have an infinite number of high res monitors all around me. Probably with high color accuracy since Apple is making it. I also assume that Apple will bring some enhanced version of Sidecar so that you can use your more powerful Mac Studio to run heavy programs, while only using the Vision Pro as an Extended Reality display. (Maybe just wirelessly transferring App windows, rather the whole OS, to minimize percieved latency when turning your head?)

My biggest worry about Apple Vision Pro (and similar headsets) is comfort. Is it comfortable to do an entire work-day with these on? What about watching a 3 hour movie? Is it comfortable wearing a good headset at the same time?
I'm less worried about battery since there is the possibility for swapping batteries with the Vision Pro, and there will probably be a market for third party power accessories with higher battery capacity.


Maybe the VR revolution is less about games and 3D work, and actually just about having a portable high quality screen?
At work today I had to use Premiere Pro on a 14"" MacBook Pro without external displays. A horrible experience as I end up spending more time rearranging my workspace and finding the correct panel, rather than actually editing. A high quality Extended Reality headset connected to the same laptop would have been a fantastic experience since I could have seen more panels at the same time.
Maybe we'll buy laptops without displays in the future, just connecting a VR/XR headset instead? (NUCs with batteries?)

The price needs to come down, of course. But I could imagine a lot of users being interested in replacing monitors if the quality and comfort is right."

2024-03-30,"Simply put, they are about 10 to 15 years too early.... meta is going to spend and spend and spend and others will come in later and make bank without anywhere near the investment."
2024-03-30,they are losing money. becouse after 2 years of owning the quest 2 . i still cant pay for apps/games on the quest. cant exept my paypall as a payment method... so keep playing games on steam.. and i guess im not the only one.
2024-03-30,"the battery life sucks but can be amended via third party straps such as Binbok or Bobo, though they have yet to update their batteries to service the full draw Quest 3 is capable of - reportedly 26 Watts or so , so you will find yourself hot swapping batteries more than you would otherwise, AND you will often hear a slight hum due to this discrepancy.  All this will be fixed but idiotic for Meta to introduce people to VR with the pathetic excuse for a headset / battery life and THEN insult them further with a massively overpriced ""elite"" head strap and charger.  It will turn some people off for a good long time sadly.  Perhaps they should have further reduced the price and sold a cheaper strap  w/ hot swappable battery; c'mon already you had all that time to learn from the Q2, get it together !"

2024-03-30,Its also twice as expensive
2024-03-30,Is that Linus’s car? What color is that?
2024-03-30,"If Linus was any good he would be doing a proper job, so easy to be critical if you are not very good.
He's making money with false pretences won't watch him again."
2024-03-30,So far seen more apple vision holes recently
2024-03-30,Does anyone know if this headset still makes you have a Facebook account?
2024-03-30,"There exists a third party headstrap for both the Meta Quest 2 and now the Meta Quest 3 called ""Bobo VR M3 Pro"" for the Quest 3 (M2 pro for the Quest 2), and it has magnetic interchangeable batteries, which actually can eliminate the batterylife issue if you have 1 battery charging while the other one is in use. I do this all the time with my Quest 2"
2024-03-30,"Well, you want $259 for a jacket :)"
2024-03-30,My biggest gripe is the controller tracking. I hope the repairs for my apartment get done soon. I really miss my index. I have grown to hate the quest 3 controllers.
2024-03-30,"Long time viewer and lover of this channel, but very disappointed to see that with anti-Semitism at an all time high and a major subject at the moment you chose to use: from ""Zucks vision for the future"" with a title that says ""Simulated Lizard Vision"" which is a classic anti-Semitic trope. Poor taste!"
2024-03-30,What is the english title of this video? It's translated for me but doesn't make any sense and for some reason I can't undo that
2024-03-30,Can you wear glasses with these? What's the deal here?
2024-03-30,Can someone please explain to me what the mixed reality warping actually is
2024-03-30,Where the hell is Quest Pro??
2024-06-03,What a shot dubbing in portuguese!
2024-12-30,4:49 game name?
2024-03-30,Sold out to facebook. Yuck. Unsubbed.
2024-03-30,"Yeah, you won't wear it to work 8 hours a day. It's not confortable enough."
2024-03-30,Please do not ever make a title like that again
2024-03-30,BRO GOT A DAMASCUS CAR
2024-03-30,This video’s product placements make it unwatchable
2024-11-30,Bro doesn’t know the Apple Vision Pro isn’t as good as the quest 3
2024-03-30,How about HP VR Headsets?
2024-03-30,Callin the quest 2 a low bar but thats all I know.
2024-03-30,Steam link vr works awesome on the quest 3
2024-08-02,2 Hour Battery! No Thank's!
2024-10-31,Man linus is a scam who the heck sells a jacket for 250 dollars
2024-11-30,4:20 how do I turn that off like he said?
2024-03-30,"3:18 
50 zip ties for $15? WTF"
2024-03-30,"What? - No, the pass-through  in not ""incredible"". It's barely passable. Also, the Quest3 uses low contrast ratio panels with muted colors... Get the Pro, it's much better visuals in the areas that matter most. Resolution is already good enough. Bad contrast and color is way more noticeable and important to creating the illusion of reality. Especially in a PCVR scenario."
2024-03-30,"i get angry every time he gets me with a segue way, and it happens a lot"
2024-03-30,Anyone got any advice on the heating issues for quest 3????? I love the quest 2 it was amazing as a first vr headset at the time i got it but now it does feel blurry and taccy since i upgraded myself for the quest 3. Everything about the device is amazing to me and it does do a great job on pcvr too aswell as a standalone headset. However unfortunately as linus points out in this video... The quest 3 does get HOT! for me its to the point i feel heat coming from the lens towards my eyes when ive only been using for 10 mins in something like skyrim vr. Any advice on keeping it a bit cooler???
2024-03-30,If it had everything you would complain about you would then complain about the price it would have to be
2024-03-30,"Sounds a bit overenthusiastic. I would've liked a more grounded review well... More. One, that also features the negatives more. Besides the technical ones. I mean we all (should) know Meta is trying to get ALL our data, but a notion of the ToS you agree to etc should've been there."
2024-03-30,"This is a spot-on VR set purchase recommendation, to which I've also arrived. Thank you for further solidifying it!"
2024-11-30,How many people noticed 13:34?
2024-03-30,ive never seena anyone shit on the quest 3 so nicely lol. nice shit
2024-03-30,Nintendo 3DS had some AR capability.
2024-03-30,when are you going to shame Vision Pro by comparing it with MQ3?
2024-03-30,Pico 4 is sold online in Walmart lol
2024-03-30,Awesome content!
2024-05-04,Q3 ps5 e bağlanabiliormu acaba wifi ye bağlanıp istediğim yerde vr videolar izleyebiliormuyum.
2024-03-30,"next year they’ll come out with a 4 and charge $500. the lenses will be better.  they purposely make inferior products, so you have to buy the new one every time they put one out.  just like apple."
2024-03-30,"The idea that buying into metaverse will *ever* be a good idea is laughable, luckily you don't have to use it with their headset. Also, their R&D is not costing them as much as you imply, rather it's infrastructure for metaverse and integration with other systems... And it's a cost they can trivially afford. In tech investment this is how it works, you spend everything because even the losses are gains in taxes you don't pay."
2024-03-30,Wtf is that car he just rolled up in? Linus is such a tool lol
2024-11-30,Linus your The Best actually enjoyed the end
2024-03-30,"Does anybody know if you just leave the thing plugged in, even if it’s low on battery will it still operate. Wanna use this as a desk utility plugged in all the time but don’t wanna have to wait for it to charge, THEN use it. 

Plus not dropping 150 for the battery back. Maybe 70 for an off brand if I need to"
2024-03-30,$15 for cable ties? Wtf?
2024-03-30,"I want gloves for good tracking but all we get is empty promises of uber fluid power 3d atomic haptics with 6 gigatons of force feedback at 4 trillion dollars a glove :(
like please just track my hands"
2024-03-30,Watched this again after the Vision Pro reviews and it just made it so clear at how incredible apple did with their first ever 'spacial computing' headset
2024-03-30,The new glasshole
2024-03-30,wtf is that jacket $250 wtf
2024-03-30,"Average game sesh of 2 hours is enough for most gamers?

When did gamers get so…. Soft…?"
2024-03-30,it's funny how many arguments I've gotten into over the shit products that Meta puts out.  Just a heads up when watching reviews.  When every single statement has to be qualified first?  That says everything you need to know.
2024-03-30,Lol you can buy a Meta Quest 2 for just the price of a LTT jacket!
2024-03-30,Maybe I should upgrade from my quest 1…
2024-03-30,i want to play yugioh on this so badly
2024-05-04,"I feel like this is unlikely, but does anyone know if this or the quest to has an option to stream games to the headset via ideally something line GamePass, but make it look like you're playing on a large monitor/TV? I know you can simulate a large TV or theatre on there, but what I'm hoping is that maybe there's a GamePass app for Meta, or if not if there's a way to run it on your phone/cheap laptop and then have it streamed to a virtual large screen. Then you can okay the game like normal using a standard Bluetooth controller like a ds4. Obviously the game library would be limited to cloud available titles just like on a phone so the headset isn't actually rendering the games, just displaying them. I love GamePass, but find playing games on my phone screen is terrible, and the galaxy phones are the only ones that offer a way to plug it directly into an external monitor (through Dex), at least that I'm aware of. Side note, that should honestly be a universal feature by now considering how simple it should be ..."
2024-12-30,In my country the quest 3 costs more than 800 dollars
2024-11-30,5:43 yea because everybody casually owns 2 500$ headsets
2024-03-30,they obviously gonna make a quest 3 pro with oled just watch
2024-03-30,"Did you just say the Quest 3 microphone is ... OK? 

It's ABYSMAL, go compare it to the Quest 2."
2024-03-30,"The quest 3 has been the worst headset I have owned.

It's possibly the least comfortable headset you can buy

Passthrough is weak and grainy (but better than the quest 2)

Battery life is atrocious (can't even make it through a round of Demeo)

All around, terrible at everything.

Thankfully, my beyond will be here tomorrow"
2024-03-30,"Amazing hardware for this price, but software is trash. Hopefully they will copy Apple's UI after the Vision Pro comes out."
2024-05-04,Please can we have an up to date look at the VR market. I've just bought one and I'm wondering if I made the right choice.
2025-01-29,how do you turn off the FFR?
2024-03-30,"00:15 Wrong... Meta is totally treating their headsets as gaming consoles since the first Quest. And that is why people should just buy their games on Steam, so they don't have to buy them again and again every time they change headsets or buy a headset that doesn't use the Meta Store or whatever it's called."
2024-03-30,250 bucks for that 30 dollar jacket???
2024-03-30,Bro I wanted to sell my 2 for the 3 but it bricked itself due to an update I can see the boot logo but once it boots I can’t see anything but I can still move the controllers and hear the noise it makes when it highlights something I tried factory resetting and I tried reinstalling the update using ADB but I can’t figure it out and I can’t find anyone to help me
2024-03-30,Wasn't he cancelled?
2024-03-30,"for me the quest 3 looks like a downgrade compared to the pico 4 (which is my headset), i play wirelessly with my pc and have 0 latency and its cheaper than the quest 3 and i do not care about ar, also the passthrough in the pico looks amazing even though it has no depth sensor"
2024-03-30,Playing beat saber is worse with Q3 controllers than Q2...
2024-03-30,a vest for 250$
2024-03-30,"PlayStation VR2 destroys this headset IMO. Better tracking, OLED screen, better battery life, better hand tracking."
2024-05-04,Q3 almak istiyorum ama pc yok.ps5 var .q3 ile ps5 e bağlanabilirmiyim wigi ile

2024-03-30,"As a quest developer, I fucking can’t stand the quest or the whole meta eco system."
2024-03-30,The TOF sensor isn't used for anything but the initial MR room setup. No software has been able to utilize it for anything yet.
2024-05-04,suggesting to save and spend 1600 instead is so out of touch
2024-03-30,Can u play this in sun now
2024-03-30,"Jesus Christ, what is this auto dubbing in Portuguese? Why do you insist in using something that will not help, and instead make things worse. The best example ever is the title: ""Eu sou um buraco de Quest agora"" or, in your language, ""I'm a hole of Quest now"", WHAT??? What title is this? Your content is great, if you want to reach more audience, do not use this cheap AI."
2024-03-30,Shane Gillis is writing VR reviews for you???
2024-03-30,"I’ve just grown to hate Linus. Sorry buddy, you’ve just become so annoying to listen to, especially those ridiculous ads all sputtered throughout your videos. A 3D Down Jacket for 250 US? Greed and capitalism at its finest"
2024-03-30,over price  like the ltt screw driver
2024-03-30,10:45 Wiggley Cat LUL
2024-10-01,You’re too deep into the minutiae here. You were saying features this thing don’t have that people didn’t even know existed. lol
2024-05-04,"1:04 Looks like they hired some old Nintendo Wii Sport programmers 
PS4 Vader Immortal from 2019 looks way better."
2024-07-03,Meta quest 3 is awesome
2024-07-03,"Thanks.  I will never buy a piece of hardware that forces you to login to a company to use it -- especially Facebook.  Yeah, I know I'm doing that with Android and Windows, but this feels different and I'm evaluating my relationship with Google and Microsoft too -- especially given the new Windows 11 we track everything you do feature!"
2024-03-30,You guys should stop using the word “serviceable”. It’s not the right word for the intent you have.
2024-10-01,holy shit dude $250 jacket i’m sorry bro but you lost your damn top
2024-03-30,Where virtual desktop?
2024-03-30,apple vision pro is only 3000usd away from the quest 3
