2023-08-25,Bose earbuds ultra are rumored to launch in the next month. I would wait for it. II have a bunch of issues.
2023-08-25,"I‚Äôd wouldn‚Äôt buy them again, or Bose tbh. I wanted the for the APTX low-latency codec the said they were going to add, but still haven‚Äôt. You can tell once they launch a product, supporting it is not a priority. Plus they are way too glitchy for the price point. My opinions obv."
2023-08-25,"They sound great. The app is terrible, it does not work"
2023-08-26,"I'm currently fighting with my pair of QC2 earbuds.  Sound quality is out of this world, but I have to uninstall and reset them back to factory settings at least once every two weeks.  One earbud will all of a sudden refuse to connect, and only after several reinstall attempts do they both work again,    


But when they work.....man are they good.  Noise cancelling is out of this world and they have a very rich warm deep bass.    


So yeah, if you don't mind the buggy nature of the bluetooth, they're fantastic."
2023-08-26,"Dude both my brother and my bose qc buds broke. They kept connecting randomly , loses all battery, and they broke out of nowhere bc they wouldn‚Äôt charge anymore.

The noise cancelling was great but thats it. they also kept falling out of my ears. Worst experience"
2023-08-25,The lack of multipoint is a deal breaker for me so I don‚Äôt have QCII. I would look elsewhere unless ANC is your absolute priority. I have read good stuff about the AZ80 and XM5. Best of luck
2023-08-25,"Gottem effectively for free when my sounds sport wireless buds had an issue after 2 years.

Asked to get my broken buds back because I had all sorts of connection issues with these. The issues seem to have died down now, but that might just be because I've subconciously adjusted to their quirks.

Things like opening up audible would send them into a loop of connecting and disconnecting and would then become unusable. Even after following the directions for fully resetting them wouldn't work. 

As I said, the issues have sort of subisded for now, but I would still give these a miss. I can't beleive they put such a high price tag on them tbh."
2023-08-25,"I‚Äôm a Bose person, but picked up the Technics, the sound stage is wider and crisper, better bass, and my voice, according to others, sounds much clearer, the ANC is really good but slightly less effective - but we‚Äôre talking marginally less effective in a side by side comparison 

That said, I do have the NC700 for noisy environments and use the earbuds primarily to listen to music and for calls"
2023-08-25,"I like mine, they are great while flying or in noisy environments. I haven't experienced the dropped connections or other issues that others have encountered."
2023-08-25,Buy from Bose and then return them within 90 days for the upcoming Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds Ultra
2023-08-25,"Bose messed up QC1 really bad. Just browser intermittent red led. Happened to me.
QC2 sound amazing and the noise canceling is awesome.
But there are other and better alternatives. I will not buy Bose again."
2023-08-25,"So I‚Äôve had 2 pairs now. The first we‚Äôre a returned pair and a reduced price, they were faulty with sound problems and charging issues. Bose replaced them but the brand new pair they sent are still having issues with sound cutting in and out etc. unfortunately I‚Äôm going have to change them for the new Sonys ü§ûüèª the ANC is anything like Bose"
2023-08-25,"No. There's a plastic ring that can move. If it does and you don't put it back in the right spot, then when you plug them into the case they won't charge. I've also lost volume in the right headphone and I've tried everything to correct it to no avail. I wish I had another pair to recommend, but all I can say is avoid these."
2023-08-25,"I hate them. The sound glitches are terrible and make me not want to use them. 
I even got a new pair QCII with the promise that they would work perfectly. Hell no. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
2023-08-26,"I came to Bose and got the QCII.  The app sucks and I wasted a lot of time trying to get it to work.  With that being said, Sony's customer support has been awful.  If anything goes wrong, you're told to send your product to a 3rd party service somewhere in NY, and then they quote you for repairs.  I had the XM3, but one side stopped working out of nowhere after 2 years of use.  

So far I have a Wave 4 radio, SoundLink Flex, and the QCII.  So far so good, but buyer beware, Bose fans will be Bose fans.  I love everything so far.  Changing brands to me is a big deal lol.  

Sennheiser is very reputable.  The Momentum 3 looks solid.  Have you considered Audio Technica (ATH TWX9 $300, or the ATH ANC300TW $159) and BeyerDynamic (Free Byrd $179, on sale from $300)?  I think coming from Soundpeats, any of these would be a huge upgrade.  I'd personally go for the QCII, Free Byrd, or Momentum 3.  Also, the Sennheiser Momentum 3 is on sale at $199, down from $279.  

All these prices are from the direct website, and you might bode well by searching online elsewhere for potentially better prices."
2023-08-26,"Here is my opinion about Quiet Comfort 2:

Pros:
- more comfy than the previous generation
- huge improvement in ANC
- Better sound quality(only if you wear both earbuds)


Cons:
- no more switch between devices with the case button which is a huge drawback. It takes way more time to switch using the app or bluetooth menu. Specially overwhelming when you‚Äôre listening to something on a different device and your phone rings. You will miss the call if you try to switch. 
- falls out from ears more than previous generation
- Quality of speaker and microphone significantly drops if you use only 1 earbud, to the point that the other side of a call can‚Äôt hear you. You need to wear both earbuds which wasn‚Äôt the case with the 1st generation 
- No wireless charging capability 

Overall:
- way overpriced in compare to rivals
- Not really an upgrade from 1st generation"
2023-08-26,"Absolutely, positively not worth it.  As a few have mentioned here:

- Call quality sucks.
- Randomly loses connection.
- No ability to change tap settings leading to unintentional pause/play/skip when adjusting in ear.
- Sound becomes echoed at times, so you‚Äôll need to turn Bluetooth off and put it back on to clear you sound issue.
- App is glitchy.

I‚Äôve had mine since December and started with these issues around month 4.  Some days are good and some days I want to throw them away and never look back.

I agree with another user, when they are working on a good day they are great for music and noise cancelling.  Otherwise they are a total piece of shit and Bose should be ashamed of this product.  I have a lot of Bose products but this experience will be my last."
2023-09-19,"I have had QC Earbuds II for around a year now and can honestly say I HATE them. I have returned the product two different times because there are constant BT issues with iPhone 14. The earbuds will work for a few months, but then out of nowhere, the buds will not connect to ANYTHING - my iPhone, my wife's iPhone, my iPad, my Windows laptop nor my wife's MacBook Air.

I

1. forget the device through the BT settings on the device
2. delete the Bose Music app
3. restart the device
4. reinstall the Bose Music app
5. attempt to re-register the product
6. Hard reset the product as well, just to be back at the same issue

and ...... nothing happens. The app doesn't recognize the earphones, and BT on the devices does not recognize the earphones either. I repeat the process several times. Then I just try with BT on the phone and hope it works..... Sometimes it does, sometimes it does not. That with the fact that they have said several times they'd support APTX codec, and never delivering on it is quite disappointing.

When they work, they sound great, but when they don't it's beyond frustrating. That coupled with

&#x200B;

1. the fact Bose seemingly only cares about collecting money up front and not improving their products

and

2. I just sent in the QC Earphones II for the 2d time in a year and they announced a NEW version this week and said ""we cannot even allow you to pay an additional $50 to get the Ultra's, they are only for pre order""

sealed it for me. I will sell these online and get a better pair of headphones"
2023-10-28,"No.   I bought a pair about a month ago because my three year old airpods finally quit working after going into the washer machine.   I work 10 to 14 hour shifts and normally have one ear bud in the whole day listening to music, podcasts, books or making phone calls.  With my airpods I never had any problems.   I'd put them in in the morning, they'd connect to my phone and that was that.

Some mornings my bose just don't connect, and when I open the app they say connection not available.  I have to struggle with them to get them connected.   Sometimes the just randomly disconnect and I can't even understand why... then they reconnect a few minutes later.  The touch controls suck.  Sometimes I have a hard time pausing music and answering calls.

When I get a phone call and the call is over the audio quality is strange.  So I have to cycle through the modes to get back to the one i was on prior to the call.  

I am honestly thinking about just giving these things away and buying another pair of airpods.  Because what should be a comfort to me during my long days of work has turned into a constant source of frustration, and I really don't  have time to be messing with these things while I am at work.  

While the audio quality is good, everything else sucks and I hate them.  I wish I was a youtuber so I could make a review encouraging people not to buy them... and I can't really afford to trash a pair of 300 dollar earbuds and replace them so I'm stuck with these things."
2023-11-20,"I have Bose Quiet Comfort earbuds. Purchased them in December 2021. They are not used often. This morning the buds were blinking red and white. I followed the instructions for updating the earbuds which I found at [btu.Bose.com](https://btu.Bose.com).  According to the site, my earbuds are up to date. After a chat with Bose customer service, I was told my product was out of warranty. I was also told the ear buds were probably fine but the charging case had failed and apparently this is very common. The solution was for me to buy a new set. I spent almost $250 on these earbuds when they were new and now they are junk. In my opinion, Bose should recall these failing charging cases. In any event, I do not trust the product enough to buy another. So, bye bye to Bose and it‚Äôs earbuds and off to search for something else. As a side note, I have had several Bose products in the past and had no issues. It is a shame they are making a product with so many similar complaints as mine and the Bose solution seems to be ‚Äúbuy new ones‚Äù. Sad."
2023-08-25,"For a reduced price, yes if you know what they can do.I haven't had any issues even before the update.They come with a replacement warranty anyway."
2023-08-25,No. They are garbage. Get refurbed Gen I.
2023-08-25,"For music , very nice. For calls, terrible. I returned mine."
2023-08-26,"After I had three sony xm4 somehow break on me I switched to the qc 2. The noise cancelling is way better than the sonys, also all day comfortable I sometimes forget they are in. Recommended best buy warranty on earbuds"
2023-08-26,"Absolutely they are. They are the best. 
Problem is... the Ultra Earbuds are about to be released. (And, yes, I agree with the other poster who mentioned it... too soon for new earbuds...)
So... you should wait!! üòä"
2023-08-26,Against all advice I just picked a pair last week and so far they're really good. Hopefully they don't break down on me soon.
2023-08-27,The nice thing about Sony is their LDAC Bluetooth mode which I can tell the difference vs just plain aac with the bose
2023-12-01,"Hi man, I'm right now searching for a good pair of buds and when I've seen QC at 200‚Ç¨ I surely was tempted.

At last what have you choose, and it was worth it?

Ps. My budget is a bit more limited, on the 100/180‚Ç¨ but I can make the investment if it gets me better quality"
2024-01-24,"I am brand loyal when it comes to Bose, but was on the fence about their earbuds, but thanks to reddit reviews, I was able to save $300 by deciding to not go inside the store! Thanks reddit!"
2024-02-18,"Listent, those things are fantastic for what they do. But... after 6 months 1 year they start having some problems. And the mic is terrible."
2024-06-17,"My Bose earbuds lasted a year. Don‚Äôt hold up well. Without an extended warranty, bose will not stand behind their product.  I‚Äôd recommend a different option. 
In my case, the ear buds had an unrepairable issue and Bose wanted me to upgrade for another lightly discounted price. A clear pass on these"
2024-06-18,"My new-in-box soundsport free wireless earbuds arrived DOA, but out of warranty, so I took a deal from the support agent to buy a pair of replacement QCIIs for $90 + tax.  I took the deal, because I have fond memories of my old noise-cancelling wired QC ear buds and my QC25s are still going strong, but we will see how it goes.  Really want the very best noise cancelling earbuds I can find to listen to music while working in a noisy shop."
2024-06-25,"Had the xm4 and they sound amazing but the bose QC 2 earbuds sound imo kinda better, so if you like more punch and bass while listening to music go for the xm4/xm5 
If you like a crispy, clear and balanced sound go for the bose. 
They both sound miles better with android.
No issues with both."
2024-03-23,"I have owned a pair of Bose QC2 for about 12 months.
Noise cancelling is fantastic.  
Unfortunately the right side bud now only operates at about 1/2 volume.
Bose reckons it's a problem with my ear canal or the seal..... NOT.
Tried  Sony but their noise cancelling is comparatively shit... Good music quality though."
2024-04-20,"BOSE QC II EARBUDS ARE HORRIBLE. I literally can never connect to my Macbook or IPhone (I think device is relevant) seamlessly. Why am I sitting here connecting 5-10 times each time I want to use them and having to hold/prop the case open for a $200 product? nevermind the fact it was over $200 at the time it was purchased. The noise cancellation and sound quality is NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO MITIGATE THE HORRIBLE CONNECTIVITY ISSUES!!!! and Bose has horrible customer support. This feels like the biggest waste of money and I am severely disappointed. Back to Airpods as soon as I can move on/save up from this expense. 



P.S. While writing this review I was taking a photo of how I have to keep the case propped open for it to stay connected. Guess what? The case closed while I was doing so and now I have to spend another 5 minutes connecting and disconnecting hoping it will stay connected as I try to prop it up again. HORRIBLE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2024-07-26,"Can anyone tell me sony Wf-1000xm5 or bose quietcomfort 2 which one is best for long run?
Coz i heard that after 1 year sony have faster battery drain issue or Bose have double sound or echo sound problem or connectivity problem so if any of you use any one earbuds for last 11 months or 12 months please share your review"
2024-09-23,Bose earbuds at are legitimately ass. Noise cancellation is ass. The charging doc doesn‚Äôt charge the ear buds. Theyll be in there for days and you‚Äôll open up the case and they‚Äôll be dead despite the case being fully charged. What a fall from grace for this pos company. EAD Bose.
2023-08-25,Use the search function
2023-08-26,"I‚Äôve never had battery issues with the Sony xm4 earbuds. I‚Äôve had them 2 years. My girlfriend also put them through a washing machine cycle (outside the case).

I thought for sure they were toast. One sounded a bit weird but cleared up in a few days. Now they are still going 100% strong. Now that‚Äôs durability.

I also have the Bose qc 45 cans when i want longer battery + comfort. I actually use the Sony xm4 buds for running in ambient mode. The bose are nice - but I really hate the Bluetooth multi connect. I‚Äôm not a sales guy. It just causes chaos. Connect to one thing for the love of God lol

But yeah Sony xm4 ‚Äî great sound. Great ANC. I think i replaced the stock tips right away to something known for comfort. Oh they sound bad when the built in microphone is in use (same with the Bose) so I only use earphone mics in an emergency."
2023-08-26,I like the sound but mic is absolute dogshit. Way too sensitive and picks up everything except my voice
2023-08-26,"I bought ones since last year, and I  regret of it.
The sound is Great just like and TWS 3 from Sennheiser or a X4 from Sony , but the lack of wireless charging and the annoying app are red flags, if that  is not enough the case is so fragile that get broken in the first fall from the desk ( yeap a normal desk ). And the worst part of all is that I had to make a full reset every 2 month because they start to have connectivity issues, I hate that"
2023-08-26,sounds good but it won‚Äôt last
2023-08-28,"Bose QC II are the best one to ride a bike, without any noise ( I used anc on bike since ten years, a much better solution than a heavy and expensive helmet and not comparable ), further more if you got big ears Bose is the only one for simple adaptatives tips, in two parts and they fit fine and last, but you need to buy the XL separately. Sony tips are two small for mine, and I  had to make me made mold-in ears tips, which is less bearable after few hours. And as said above Bose delivers the best ANC."
2023-11-05,"Personally, I found the qc buds 2 to be an excellent choice. Bose music app works fine for me and both the sound quality and ANC are amazing. However, the lifetime of its battery is average. Overall, it is worth it. :)"
2023-11-16,Hell no. They are a nightmare.
2024-02-04,"yes, they are pretty good"
2025-01-29,"Hey... so after looking for reviews extensively and after going through a lot of reviews, the general opinion was to not get em. I did come accross similar reviews to that of QC ii for the QC ultra too. 

After this i ended up buying the Soundcore Liberty 3 pros. After that, i came across a good deal for the Sony XM5 headphones and bought a pair. 

Currently, I have, 

1. Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro 
2. Sony XM5
3. CMF buds pro (which i keep in my bag for emergency purposes )

I would recommend the Soundcore and the XM5 if you're looking for high end. Both have Hi-res. 

I think the Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro is out too. Check that out if interested. 

Or.. you can wait a month or 2 for the Sony XM6.

I have heard that the latest from Bose is pretty good but i can't say anything about how they perfirm on the long run."
2023-08-26,Earbuds ultra? Seriously? I thought we were only expecting over ear ultra headphones to replace the 700s?
2023-08-26,Plz tell me everything u kno I love the quiet comfort series I‚Äôve had the first and I‚Äôm using the second model currently. They have their issues but the sound quality and noise cancellation is amazing & they fit the ear well. I‚Äôd definitely be tryna get those even if they‚Äôre slightly better
2023-08-26,"What glitches? Never had any with the xm4.

I will say the only minor nuisance is. There‚Äôs limited onboard controls for ease of use.

If you stick with anc on/off on the left ‚Äî the right you get back, forward, pause, play ‚Ä¶ then you get no volume control. 

Or you can swap anc for volume but. They need all 3. Otherwise they‚Äôre great"
2024-03-01,I agree. Sound is great but 1 earbud refuses to connect and they just have a mind of their own. Not worth it
2023-08-25,I too read some good reviews of the AZ80. The XM5s on the other hand is showing potential battery issues like in the XM4s. Anyways I would want all the features I can get for the price I'm paying. Thanx anyways mate.
2023-08-26,"Multipoint is utter ass. Because you can‚Äôt turn it off.

You‚Äôre listening to Spotify on your computer. Oop your phone just connected and is ringing with a spam call!

Multi point should go straight to hell.

The xm4 doesn‚Äôt have it. Fantastic. The bose qc 45 you can‚Äôt disable it. It actually a negative feature that crapifies the product."
2024-01-14,What model of technics you're referring to? Thanks.
2024-01-23,"you will, they're crap"
2023-10-21,So you prefer the 2s to the original QC?
2023-12-03,"Which ones do you prefer? I'm open to any brands, just as long as they stay connected, stay in the ear, and don't hurt. I'm also open to any style such as ear hooks or whatever, just as long as they cover the ear canal in some way."
2023-08-25,Friendly advice... The XM5s are already showing some potential battery issues like in the XM4s and the Linkbuds S. I'd advise you to wait a bit for 2 or 3 months till some issues surface and then buy if there aren't any...
2023-10-28,"Yea mine are always doing this double sound thing or some thing.   I rarely use both earbuds, but when I do I get this double sound glitch every few minutes.   Not what you would expect with a 300 dollar product.   I'd almost prefer a cheap pair of corded earbuds to these things."
2023-08-26,"Thanx a lot for the suggestions. I'll definitely look into them. As for the QCIIs and the Momentum 3s, as far as I have researched about the momentum 3s and the user opinions I got from this post, they have a lot of issues. I need something that lasts at least 2 years for the price I'm paying (As a matter of fact I never thought the Soundpeats would hold on for this long).

The Momentum 3s have some kind of battery issues and many recommended not to buy it although it's on sale."
2024-08-24,I share this same sentiment. They really should be ashamed this product is on the market. I wish I would've done my research before purchasing
2023-11-13,Can I please ask what you got in place of the QC 2‚Äôs?
2023-08-26,So you don't have any issues with the connectivity or battery like the others?
2023-08-29,Are there really ultra earbuds coming? I thought the ‚Äúultra‚Äù rumors/leaks were for headphones not earbuds
2024-01-23,"No, they're dogshit, like almost every other comment here has mentioned"
2023-11-11,"How are they for you, almost 3 months on?

Thanks for your thoughts!"
2024-01-23,They will.
2023-12-02,"After considering all the reviews and stuff although QCs were tempting... Finally ended up with a soundcore space A30. It's compact, fit is great, sound quality is great (not very bassy but has good bass) supports LDAC, around 8hrs battery life with ANC on (case can hold up to 50hrs). Btw the buds has custom EQ and also it has a feature to tune specific to your ear type.
I charge the buds like once in a week or so. No issues faced so far... Been using it around 2 months or so."
2024-08-14,"After thorough research and taking into consideration countless other reviewers and redditors, i decided not to. 
I got the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros on a good deal. So far, no issues. Suits my needs."
2023-08-25,"My friend, if you have used the earbuds, then your opinion would be really helpful and valuable. Else just don't fool around trying to make silly jokes just to get more upvotes."
2023-08-29,"Same here, I‚Äôd be curious to know more about these ultra earbuds. I thought the leaks were just of ultra headphones"
2024-11-26,"La peor compra que he hecho, lo √∫nico bueno es la bater√≠a y nada m√°s!!!"
2023-08-26,"I was referring to the Bose QCii, not the xm4, but i see how my phrasing is confusing. Meant that I wouldn‚Äôt even consider buying Bose brand earphones ever again in general."
2024-03-01,"As an update, I contacted Bose, and they got me to send my pair back.  Within a week I had a new pair free of charge and it's been flawless ever since."
2024-01-14,AZH 60 buds
2024-10-19,"Original QC is ass, mine worked fine for 2 years, then white-red lights. I tried to repair them by myself, but it didnt work. Maybe I have crooked hands, but half of QC users face this problem."
2023-12-04,"The Bose qc2 are very good. The thing is that I am not buying anything Bose related.
I am currently using the Sony WH1000XM and I am loving it."
2023-08-25,üëÄ nooooooooooooo
2024-08-28,Same!  About 2 months after leaving this comment one of the ear pieces completely died and would not charge no matter what I did.  After doing my research I learned this is common and Bose will give you refurbished headphones for about 1/2 the price of a new set.  I read that these refurbished headphones are no better than the brand new ones so I never bothered.  I went back to my 2019 AirPods that die in 2.5 hours and don‚Äôt have noise canceling but it is what it is!
2023-08-26,I have experienced some only recently but I learned how to reset the earbuds and case by holding the button for 20 seconds and they went back to normal.
2023-09-01,"Yes, both. And I'm quite sad because I bought the QC Earbuds II just a month ago ‚òπÔ∏è I thought the new ones would come out in 2024... But no, both in 2023, headphones and earbuds. And the Ultra Earbuds will be so much lighter than the QC Earbuds II ‚òπÔ∏è"
2023-11-11,"They're working perfectly. No disconnection issues at all, great battery life, sound, etc. I'm happy with my purchase."
2024-01-23,"Not yet fortunately, still going strong."
2023-12-04,"Thank you, I'll check them out"
2023-08-25,"https://reddit.com/r/SonyHeadphones/s/Y6ZspSO8LH

Check this out..."
2023-08-27,Would you be able to share more information about your connectivity experience? How long did you have them before you began getting the connectivity issues? And reseting them once resolved the issue? I'm bought mine yesterday and the audio drops are consistent. Definitely unacceptable for a product this expensive. Only reason i don't want to consider other brand is because these are one of the few that stay comfortablely in my ears. They are so secure.
2023-09-01,"Oh gotcha, well I should hold off on anything then. I‚Äôve been looking around for new buds (I have first gen AirPods) and I‚Äôm hearing rumors about some updates to current AirPods Pro‚Äôs and now these ultra earbuds. I have QC45‚Äôs I quite like so I‚Äôd be keen on a new Bose product that doesn‚Äôt seem to have the connection issues of the QC buds 2"
2023-11-24,"I was spending time thinking between the sennies and bose...ended up getting something else lol.

Was not convinced with sennies build quality. I also heard reports of Bose's white noise (no music playing and there's a 'rain-like' sound). 

I have to say, bose has much better build quality from what ive seen.

Enjoy!"
2023-08-25,Just after my last reply I went to use my Bose only for them to ‚Äòloose‚Äô my phone and now they won‚Äôt turn on or connect üòÄ
2023-08-25,Tbf in my country I get a 30 day return on faulty items from the retailer and after what I‚Äôve had with my Bose I might just risk it
2023-08-27,They recently needed to be reset when turning Bluetooth on and off didn't reconnect them. One other time music said it was playing on my phone when I couldn't hear anything. Other then that they have been great! Might be phone dependent.
2023-08-28,Well just today they bugged out and I couldn't reconnect had to manually reset them.
2023-12-03,What did you end up buying?
2023-08-25,"Why don't you try the Technics EAH-AZ80. I hear that they are pretty good and I haven't seen any posts or articles  related to it having any issues so far...  Considering all these reviews above, it seems like a good option.."
2023-08-26,How about from your credit cards if you have one
2024-07-26,Hey can you tell me your experience after 11 months?
2023-12-04,"Hello!

I ended up getting the Audio Technica TWX9. 

Excellent build quality, that case, and buds just ooze quality. The beoplay ex has a better earbuds (that glass Anthracite Oxygen colour is class), but the twx9 has a better case.

Sound quality is up there. It can be natural, it can be bassy but not overly so and controlled. It has nice instrument separation. 

I believe the sennies and bose will have more ""oomph"" in the bass, but the twx9 are better controlled.

Fit is great, it comes with a gazillion earbuds, so I'd be amazed if none fit you.

Anc is decent. I think you've got to take reviewers (youtube and here, including mine) with a big pinch of salt. No earbuds can be total silence. Once you play a song (even gentle ones), most background noise is gone. I went for a flight yesterday, and it was fine. I had the whxm3(the best), whxm5(good, but not the best), wfxm4(only slightly less than the whxm5, but this is due to the foam tips). The twx9 compared to these are probably around a little bit better than the wfxm4. I personally am not exaggerating the anc, it's not bad. 

Only reason I got these, instead of sennies/bose were the reason I spoke of, and I got the twx9 for quite cheap (260). 

If the bose was cheaper, I'd get the bose. From my pov, bose has the best anc, full stop. You can't get anything better. Sound quality, is subjective. I think the bose have a generally pleasant and exciting sound profile that a lot of people will enjoy. Plus you can still tweak this a bit via the simple eq.

What this means is, the sound can still be personalised, but you know it has the best anc. Full stop. 

Where as the other options, yeah they may have good sound, but the bose also has good sound AND the best anc...

Plus the bose fits well for a lot of people. I would NOT pay anywhere close rrp though. They cheapened out on the codecs, wireless charging, case is plasticky af (for something that's aud400+). 

If you need battery life though, I believe the Sony are your only option at this range. My xm4 lasted 8 hours real life. The twx9 are more around 5 hrs. I'd say the xm5 would be similar in real life too. 

Good luck and you can ask me qs."
2023-08-25,Oh they‚Äôre by Panasonic? I‚Äôll have a look! The uk have a sale on the B&W Pi7 s2 atm I‚Äôll look at them too
2024-07-29,I returned the bose and bought the somy xm5 earbuds. Definitely recommended if you use android.
2023-12-13,"I appreciated your reply and reread it several times to absorb what you're saying about all these pricey, high-end sound buds. Your comment was helpful, thank you.

I ended up going with Samsung Buds Pro2. I was going to get the above ones you listed. I had gotten the Pro2 from Costco, and they were good, but trying even better sounding buds was tempting. But then Costco, where I bought my buds pro2 for $149, price matched what I can only guess was a brief glitch price of theirs but I was fortunate enough to screenshot when I saw it: $99 USD. Done. Can't argue with that deal for new buds.

Are they the best? Well they are good enough for me and the sound is nice. The pros are my phone, tablet and tv are Samsung, so to connect I do nothing but pop the buds into my ear - stupid easy!! And I appreciate the voice detection which turns on ambient/transparency mode, lowers the media volume, and I can set it to different lengths of time to go back to previous sound settings when it stops hearing voices. I use my buds for dog walks, so this setting is extremely helpful. Cons, I wish there were eq settings. I do not like a lot of bass, hurts my sinuses. I find the Dynamic eq is good enough, but not perfection. And I wish they had the 3 levels of ambient mode, like the buds2 (for $79). But at $99 for Pro2, they are good enough for my current uses - dog walks, housework, errands.  

If I was working in a cubicle or at a PC all day long, or flying often, I would get something completely different. Probably bt headphones with the best anc and excellent sound and a full equalizer. I could never justify losing a $150 bud at an airport, and headphones are fabulously passive-aggressive when you have that one coworker who doesn't stop talking. But glad to say that's not my life atm."
2023-08-25,"Yeah... They are priced at $300 but considering all the issues in the QC IIs, XM5s, MTWs and many other top brand earbuds in the market, atleast they got no issues and all the while providing premium features.

Let's hope they'll go on sale soon...."
2024-07-29,I heard that sony has battery drain problem i mean right side buds draining battery faster than left side
2023-12-13,"The buds2 pro are excellent value at 99 usd! 

There are no best earbuds, just the best priced. So you got it!

Agree with your points. That voice detect is so convenient (when you're initiating the conversation). 360 is great for movies. The anc is good with music on. It's light weight and fits well too. Charges fast in the case.

I also love how you can change the volume by tapping the buds (it's in the labs settings), quite useful. 

Yeah it doesn't have the thump like some other earbuds, BUT they're still very good. I enjoyed the dynamic eq. It was more exciting and well balanced still compared to out of the box. 

You got a good deal mate, well done. 

Now buy some cute af cases for it hahaha."
2024-07-29,Haven't seen that
2023-11-29,[deleted]
2023-11-29,"I use my Earbuds II with many different devices and  never encountered any connectivity issues, maybe there's some bad hardware batches floating around with compromised BT antenna or something that could explain this discrepancy, I noticed something similar with Bose On-Ear headphones a few years ago (out of 4 pairs 2 had massive connectivity issues like very short range, the 2 good pairs keep working perfectly for years now)

My earbuds II are Oct 22 / firmware 1.3.26+

Inside the case it reads model = 435911 / Made in China


The firmware however once went crazy after I changed the hotkey setting to aware mode on the right earbud (so it can be changed on either bud) in Bose Music app, a reset fixed that and the Earbuds now function well even with the changed setting."
2023-11-30,Maaaaaybe you have a defective pair?? lol imagine thinking your experience is universal
2023-11-29,"I have the same issues and decided to send them back. Just one thing: they sound very good, if not a bit to bass heavy for my taste, but that can be tuned in the eq settings.  

I found a new pair of the og quietcomforts and bought those, since I prefer the stay hear tips.  The anc isn't as good, but for the past. few hous, I've been happy to own them again."
2023-11-29,I got them recently and they work fine
2023-11-29,"Just keep returning them until you get a good one, for me took 3 pairs."
2023-11-29,"Very good sound, but the Bluetooth is really unreliable - even my Garmin tracker band seems to cause issues."
2023-11-29,The software is an absolute joke. 3 band equaliser and no preset function or even ability to save a custom preset. Bose needs a new CEO.
2023-11-30,"They really are. I don't have connection issues with mine, but for music they are garbage. ANC is god tier, yes, and they are fine for movies, podcasts and audiobooks, and comfort is great.  But I know they suck for SQ because I have zero desire to listen to music on them. I paid $35 for W240TN recently and they absolutely sing, SBC and all, and the ANC is adequate for flights. Yeah that's right, I'll take the W240TN over the Bose any day."
2023-12-03,"Used those earbuds for almost 2 years. Had to use the best buy warranty because of constant software bugs, random disconnects, randomly would not connect and randomly one earbud would die completely for 20 minutes then it would say battery 100% üòÇ

With the exchange I got the ultra, tried for 3 days after one bug I switched to airpods pro. I‚Äôm convinced Bose doesn‚Äôt care anymore about the software side of things"
2024-02-23,"I concur! I had the original QC Buds, were a piece of crap and constantly disconnected with never ending issues. I was initially impressed with support as they immediately sent me a new pair, again, garbage. Frustrated to no end, they finally sent me an upgrade to the QC II buds. Impressed with their support I was mildly happy until the QC II's displayed the same issue. At first connection they are fine. Then after a few days of use (connects, disconnects, and reconnects) suddenly the volume control does not sync with my chromebook, before long one bud or the other starts to jitter or out right disconnect. Putting them back into the case ""may"" soft reset them and get them to work again, but over the course of a few weeks, they eventually no longer connect to either my chromebook or Pixel 6. Literally ever 4 - 8 weeks I have to factory reset the buds to get them to connect again,.   


I absolutely love the sound profile, but that's about it. The fact that a lesser level of productt (SoundSport) is able to autoswitch between devices (phone to chromebook to phone) based on starting a media player or receiving a call, but these‚Äîa much more expensive product‚Äîcannot, when they are billed as a business product with industry leading noise cancellation, is a massive downgrade for more money. Add in the constant technical issues with ZERO support beyond the one year warranty for a product that is clearly defective over two generations, is just unacceptable! I will NEVER buy another Bose product of any kind."
2024-04-25,"I‚Äôve had nothing but connectivity problems for the 18 months I‚Äôve owned them. Over multiple iPhones the issues persist. I like the earbuds when they are actually connected, but the disconnects are unrelenting!!"
2024-05-05,"Ive had the same issue and it is so frustrating. At the moment i only have one working bud and they will no linger sync for some reason. Ive been trying for three days to get them working again (this time). This is my second pair of ear buds and after two years they have quit working (both pairs). They are far too expensive to replace every two years. I am now back to using a cheap pair of headphones that are partially wireless (connected to each bud) and ice had them years, they never quit working."
2024-05-14,I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one. My pair wouldn‚Äôt even turn on when I took them out of the case and now won‚Äôt connect to Bluetooth when I try to pair them again.
2024-07-03,"Bought mine in November 2022... loved them for the most part. Every once in a while they would have connectivity issues where the left one wouldn't connect/charge but charging the case back up to full charge or factory resetting always seemed to fix the issue. Week or so ago it happened again but now the case won't connect (or even blink blue like it's trying to connect) to my phone. Tried all the tricks from this sub and from the troubleshooting guide and ended up talking to bose support hoping they could help with service/replacement of the case or left bud. Because it was out of warranty they offered to give me a refurbished pair for $195...

  
Anyone have a good pair of (non-bose) noise cancelling earbuds they've pivoted to? Pretty done with Bose after this experience."
2024-07-10,"Hey this is for everyone still having issues with one or both earbuds not charging or connecting. Delete them from your Bose app and bluetooth connections. Let both the case and the earbuds' batteries completely die. Just set the earbuds out of the case overnight and in the morning put them in to drain the case and repeat. Once you get to the point where the case will no longer charge the buds, set them aside and keep flipping the case open and closing it until neither of the lights blink. Leave it for another day or so. I know it sucks but I have a backup pair of 1st gen galaxy buds(that have worked flawlessly since 2019 btw). Once you're absolutely sure they're dead, plug the EMPTY case in to fully charge. After the white light comes on showing it's fully charged, pop your buds in and let them fully charge. Both should charge now I have no idea why but I have to do this every 4-6 months. Once the buds are fully charged, take them both out and insert one back into the case. The bud charge light should show white and assuming it does, wait for it to go away before inserting the second and waiting again for the light to turn off again. (If they are showing amber then I have no idea how to help you any further I'm sorry.) Close the case and reopen and make sure both lights are showing white, then hold the back button for 40 seconds to fully reset. Take them out of the case and pop them in your ears, then turn on bluetooth, hold the button down to put them in pairing mode, and connect to them. If they both work then you can go ahead and set them up in the app as well. This is the only method I've found to get them perfectly working again and I hope this helps. I know they're on sale right now so hopefully this helps all the new people who just got them as well."
2024-08-14,"Gave up this brand and product. 

There is ""POP' sound generated intermittently when I was listensing music on bus or train. It was so annoying that the ""POP"" sound generated in serveral tens of seconds period. Contacted them and the reply is that it is normal as:

 ""It is normal to have some crackling in excessively noisy environments. Excessively noisy environments such as airplanes taking off, concerts, emergency sirens, and construction zones (among others) can overwhelm the microphones used to monitor external frequencies (part of the ANC technology) causing the headphones to crackle or distort. Be aware, this can also happen in Quiet and Aware mode. For example, have you ever held your phone too close to your mouth or talked loudly during a phone call? When you do, your voice can sound distorted to the person you are talking to. When you move your mouth away from the phone and talk at a normal level, the sound of your voice returns to normal. This is similar to what is happening when exceptionally loud noises occur in the environment where the headphones are used. It is important to know these loud environments will not damage the headphones and there is no lasting damage to the product. If you would like to reduce the amount of times this happens we recommend doing your best to move away from the loud noises. For example if you are flying choosing a seat further away from the engines will reduce this effect."" 

The only way can do is to get rid of the earbuds and to go for other brands."
2024-08-28,Just here to concur. These fucking things suck. Have a first try successful connection to my iPhone about 30% of the time. It‚Äôs terrible. And the double rubber piece set up is just an option for the sake of having one
2024-09-06,"A never ending stream of connectivity issues, my favorite being when they randomly connect ""mic only"".  Now they don't conenct at all; just garbage."
2024-09-19,"Omg man thank you so much. I had connectivity issues with them and also distortion, but used my warranty so they replaced it with the new ultra, but now since I read that you're saying that the ultra are garbage too, I may just be prepared to replace them again or trade them for a different brand by selling them on the market. Any suggestions?"
2024-09-26,The fkn app is a POS too!!
2024-10-17,Likewise. At least it sounds like some of yall got replacements I‚Äôve just been getting ignored by them for the past year üòÅüòÅ
2024-11-27,Agreed! THE WORST!!!
2024-12-02,Spent over 4 hours trying to get my QC earbuds to work... What a waste of time! The connectivity issues are unsurmountable. Trying to get Support is worthless. So unhappy with Bose!!!! Don't waste your money nor your time!
2024-12-04,"just bought a pair of Quiet Ultra, yesterday. They worked yesterday , today they will not make sound. says they are connected to my Pixel 8 Pro but they make no sound. i cant seem to get them to do any thing but the noise canceling is on that i tell..."
2024-12-19,mine wont stop active noise canceling no matter how many times i ensure that the mode should have it off
2024-12-19,"I've had them for the last 2 months and it's been a horrible experience. They never connect properly and I always have to debug them, trying to get them to connect properly to my iphone. The most common bug is that only one earbud connects and the other would not turn on, no matter what. Sometimes the ""bad"" earbud would work but only after 5-10 min. I think the product is faulty by design and Bose have been super cunning by keep on selling it, instead of admitting the fault. 

I've just decided to return them and never buy any Bose product ever. Horrible product all in all and whenever you google about this issue you realise how common it is, yet the Bose people just offer the same lame fix - resync. well, that is useless"
2025-01-14,"Yeah, they're the pits.  I'm on my third pair.  I've used them all with multiple devices, always the same kinds of problems: they stop talking to each other, stop talking to the device, say they're connected but they're not, etc etc.  At some point one pair started crackling too, which switched things up a bit from the usual.

The three pairs were all obtained in different countries, a long time apart.  My conclusion is that this isn't a bad batch, but that Bose have given up on making products that work.  It's a shame, since they're great when they work, but who has the time or reserves of zen to spend hours every week coaxing expensive tech into functioning properly?"
2025-02-06,"Wish i would have seen this before I got mine. Absolutely ridiculous the amount of effort required to troubleshoot connectivity issues, especially for a brand like Bose"
2025-02-25,I agree. Worst purchase ever.
2025-02-27,Was dumb enough to get a second pair and it‚Äôs the same shit. Taken great care of them and they just go from 100% to 0. Or don‚Äôt reach out to my phone
2023-11-29,"Yeah, got these day 1 alongside AirPod pro 2‚Äôs with foam tips on the app2 I found the ANC to be better and none of the connectivity issues. Plus occasionally wear a hood, so Bose were a nightmare. Then tried the XM5‚Äôs having previously had the XM4‚Äôs. stuck with APP 2‚Äôs easily the best for me!"
2023-11-29,I was having connectivity issues on these until I disabled Bluetooth permissions for the Bose music app and I haven‚Äôt had many since. The odd time while at the gym they will just randomly disconnect from my phone but it takes a second to connect back. It is very annoying but as someone who can‚Äôt find earbuds to fit comfortably and sound great I am willing to put up with that.
2023-11-29,I just sent mine back because of this issue. It was so frustrating
2023-11-29,I have the QC2 ultras and they are superb
2023-11-30,No issue with mine at all.
2023-11-30,Mine work just fine
2023-11-30,"You bought a faulty pair. It happens more often than it should....
Happend to me as well and I had a rellacement pair within reasonable time."
2023-11-30,Mine are great. And if my previous experience with bose customer support is anything to go by then they will stand by their product even if it's out of warranty. Don't know many companies that would ever do that. They'll likely replace it free of charge and just upgrade you to the latest model if that's all they have.
2023-11-30,Had similar issues and used a sterile wipe to clean the charging connectors in the case. Let it dry and have had zero issues since.
2023-11-30,"I use them in the gym and they are fantastic.  So I definitely don't agree with your ""at all costs"" sentiment. 

Maybe you should just avoid them for ""all things.""

#ü§∑"
2023-11-30,I've also had issues with the QC2. to me it always seemed like the onboard software is really buggy.
2023-11-30,"I was just cross-shopping these with sony wf-1000xm5. I ended up with the Sony because I had a good run with the xm4 for the last 3 years.

Got my pair of xm5 and they were awful. Sounded terrible, nothing helped, eq settings made changes but just junk. Swapped then out for another pair and all good now. Before you jump you might want to see if you can exchange."
2023-11-30,Buy the 3ANC by Status. Pretty good for its price.
2023-11-30,"My qc2 working great, I had more problems with the original quiet comfort. But the phone call quality was much better, and it didn't have this white noise on the first quiet comfort."
2023-12-01,Do you commute in a busy area? Could be that everyone else‚Äôs Bluetooth devices are on the same channels as yours.
2023-12-02,"For me, the distorted effect was fixed as soon as I deleted the app. It was happening on my QC Ultras as well. I would look towards replacing them if under warranty (you should get the ultras), update the firmware on the new earbuds, adjust the settings, and then just delete the app. If it still is giving trouble after that I‚Äôd trade in that pair for a new one and sell them for a Sony WFXM5."
2024-09-13,"I am on my 8th replacement pair.  I started with the original Quietcomfort earbuds and they keep upgrading me as they keep failing and now I am on Quietcomfort Ultras. These are now giving me the same connectivity and audio issues.

I love Bose stuff but they are totally shit.  The sound is good, the noise cancelling is great but they constantly break"
2024-04-11,Booo! I have the same problems with mine.
2024-08-09,"I‚Äôve had 3 of the quiet comfort 2 earbuds I returned each of them because they all had the exact same problem. I just recently got the ultra earbuds. Again, same issue with those too. Which sucks because the sound and noise cancellation are excellent. But everything involving the connectivity issues is just intolerable."
2024-09-10,"Uh, no.  Mine are doing the exact same thing.   These things are over priced garbage."
2025-02-12,Same issue with mine also and they suck
2024-01-18,"I'm on to my 6th pair, all warrenty replacements. The first 2 pairs were Quiet Comfort ear buds and all had connectivity issues, after reaching out to Bose for the 3rd replacement they gave me a free ""upgrade"" to the Quiet Comfort 2s. 

3rd pair (1st pair of QC2) had worked for 2 chapters of an audiobook before the sound no longer existed. I would get the message telling me the battery percentage when I first put them in but I couldn't get sound from any device I connected to it.

4th pair (2nd pair of QC2) work for a week before the left one would not longer connect to any device. 

5th pair (3rd pair of QC2) I got the longest usability until they did the same as the 1st pair of QC2 I received. 

5th pair 2.0 they accidentally sent me QC instead of QC2. 

6th and final pair (4th pair of QC2) ""work"". Left earbud works fine, right earbud only has about 50% volume after 3 months. 

7th pair do not exist because my warrenty has officially run out üèÅ


I've officially have given up on any Bose product for the foreseeable future. Currently looking for something else if anyone has any recommendations."
2023-12-01,i hope they bring back stayhear tips with ANC
2024-09-13,And now?
2024-10-30,Just here to say I also hate them. Been the most useless $200 I‚Äôve ever spent. Every single day the connection issues waste tons of time and cause so much frustration. I won‚Äôt splurge on a different kind of earbuds because I‚Äôm so mad I paid $200 for these that I demand to get my money‚Äôs worth even if it means wasting time and energy to do so. But they make me mad every single day. I hope Bose sees this thread. Absolute garbage.
2024-10-30,Is this still working for you? I‚Äôm so fed up with mine. This sounds so cumbersome but willing to try it.
2024-11-24,"For $349 one shouldn‚Äôt have to perform a multi-day, multi-step procedure that is roughly the equivalent of using chewing gum and rubber bands and hopping on one foot while reciting a spell to get them to work. Bose has become a disgraceful brand that sells high-priced Chinese-made shit."
2023-11-30,How are you liking the sony? I‚Äôm reading a lot of reviews that they break easily which has me second guessing them
2024-06-10,"today I've received WFXM5 as a replacement for battery defect XM4 which I used for 20months, paying 33‚Ç¨ of price difference, old pair silver - new ones black. I came looking if Bose buds had some kind of issues as it was alternative choice buying xm4 - and it seems it's way worse in Bose camp. lolz cheers"
2023-11-30,"They did for me, even without warranty. I exchanged my QC1 for QC2. In all honesty, I would rather not open them and sell them. They are crap, all the things OP said are true."
2023-11-29,I bought my QC 2 buds the day they came out from bose.  I was able to get a pair free of charge.  No one is out of warranty
2024-09-13,">I am on my 8th replacement pair.


at that point I'd assume it's the phone (probably Iphone) and not the earbuds. There may be some defective earbuds floating around but 7 in a row is close to impossible."
2024-04-11,Haha yea there is an expected rate of failure hose has been exchanging for qc ultra for free reach out
2024-05-31,"I've had two pairs break within a year. They're so bad. One time the speaker broke, the other time my right earbud got really hot and completely died."
2023-11-30,"I've used the xm4 for the last 3 years and they were mostly great. ANC was top knotch, especially flying. Mic was OK but not great then went out about 4 months ago. Then the battery on the left and the case battery started to go. Overall was very happy and feel I got more than my money's worth of use.

The xm5 is still up for debate. The tips provided suck, and when I use the tips from the xm4 it still doesn't seal correctly because the buds are smaller. Have some new tips on order so we'll see.

I'm afraid I don't have much to compare them to, always used OTE before the xm4s so I can't give any feedback on sound quality other than it's going to depend on finding the right tips."
2024-06-10,"Really imo the only reason to go for Bose is for their noise canceling, which is the best in the market currently especially for their QC buds and QC headphones. As someone with sensory issues they are amazing and still are, however if you‚Äôre going for Audio Quality & better universal functionality and you do not have sensory issues, then Sony will almost always be the better option. (Their Noise Canceling is also the second-best there is too)"
2023-12-01,I just got my 3rd replacement. I'm not opening and selling
2024-11-04,Thought I was the only one! I have replaced them at least 6 times. Just got a new iPhone and it‚Äôs worse than ever they basically just don‚Äôt work. Has anyone discovered an acceptable fix?
2024-08-29,"I have had 5 pairs across a year because they break so often, however will say Bose replaced them for free everytime"
2024-06-10,"I do use my buds for real hardcore noise cancelling situations, I work in construction a lot, mostly inside, often with electric tools, that is where I mostly used my XM4 which held up like a hero for 20 months and still warranty swapped to new model as easy LOL, under very noisy circumstances I put on top those big construction plastic sound insulation ear cups on top and brrrrrrrrrrrr"
2023-11-30,"Don‚Äôt do chats. Just go to the repair link. I‚Äôll post it

2024-11-04,"well maybe it's an IPhone or IOS issue then. 

I use them with several Android devices and two Chromebooks and mine have been working flawlessly for 2 years.


Test them with an Android phone to check if my theory is correct"
2024-11-24,Free shit is still shit
2024-11-04,Might just be right. My friend said this morning might be a plot by Apple to make people get their own products which is nuts
2023-11-30,"Don‚Äôt copy it, type it in fully yourself. All the things you‚Äôre describing happened to me too. 

The 4 digit code is not specific to your device so they won‚Äôt offer a free upgrade"
2023-12-01,"Not necessarily; I was able to look up 11 year old QC 25s the other day. They did indeed offer me a discount on new earbuds, because they don‚Äôt stock my
model anymore lol."
2024-11-06,"I've been using Quiet Comfort II on an S20 and S24 and they are total trash when it comes to both durability and connectivity. Worst headphones I've ever owned. 50/50 chance for them to connect either to my phone or each other. I've had to superglue the right bud back together several times now because first it came apart near the tip and now it separated right in the middle. In a two year period i've never in my life had so many problems with a set of headphones. Or any electronics, really."
2023-12-01,i pulled my code from the device itself; it was under the detachable silicone ear tip. I guess it‚Äôs possible they changed the terms of how they grant warranties on newer products.
2023-12-02,"wow!! I‚Äôm so sorry dude, that‚Äôs really shitty"
2022-11-19,"I can't get mine connected to my Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra either through the Bluetooth menu or the Bose Connect app.  The Bose Connect app keeps trying to connect to a Bose Soundlink Color II.  I don't even have one of those.  I uninstalled and reinstalled the Bose Connect app and the same thing is happening.  It makes no sense.  These do sound great on my other devices, though."
2022-11-19,"Great review! They‚Äôre an excellent pair of headphones, I just have two little gripes about them:

1.	Most importantly, both the ANC and transparency modes will glitch for certain loud noises. Most common for me are slamming a car door shut or dropping a stack of weights at the gym. These sounds cause the ANC to distort and takes a few seconds to recover. Even tapping the earbuds to do some of the control gestures cause them to rumble for a second or two. 
2.	I wish the case had more flexible charging options. It‚Äôs non-PD USB C which means if you have a PD power brick and a PD C to C cable like charging a laptop, it won‚Äôt charge. Also adding qi wireless charging would be fantastic."
2022-11-20,"I think I will try QC Earbuds II simply because my AirPods Pro 2 keep falling out of my ears, even with comply foam tips. My only worry is about the mic quality which seems to be inferior to APP2, as per the test in this video: [https://youtu.be/rNobgfoIpjo?t=375](https://youtu.be/rNobgfoIpjo?t=375) What are your thoughts on that?

Also, do you use iOS/macOS or other systems?"
2024-09-29,"I've been owning the QC II for over twonweeks now. Here's what I feel about it. Btw I had xm4 before, I lost th.somewhere. 

Bt connectivity.
Here sony xm4 wins, there is true multi point connectivity, I used to hCe my xms connected To my ipad, laptop and phone and seamlessely could answer calls on my phone and switch back to my laptops 
Though the connection was a bit fiddly. It did take time to connect the xm4s.
The QCs once connected are easier and quicker to connect than the xm4, but lack multi point connectivity. 

Battery:
I feel that the bose last longer than sony, but I was never in a situation where I felt the need for moe battery.

Anc:
Bose wins here hands down. Though I wish I would turn the ANC off on bose. Sonys xm4 ANC is good, bit nowhere as good as Bose's.

Fit:
I found my bose fitting me btter than sonys..this can be personal.

Calls:
Every review online pips the xm4 over the bose for calls, but in my experience, I've had better call quality on the bose.

Sound:
Here the bose beats sony. But the bose has the bose sound profile. If you like it, you like it.
The xm4 are excellent in sound. There's not much to choose between these two.

Apps:
I preffer the bose app, it's nicer and less fiddly."
2023-01-02,"I have used Bose home theater and been using Bose over the ear headphones for years. No match for the sound quality and comfort.
New user of Bose Earbuds II. Sound and ANC is excellent but disappointed for:
1: not having find my earbuds option
2: wireless charging
3: Couldn't figure out how to mute a phone call /Zoom call . Any help?"
2023-01-27,"Excellent review, I have the QC Earbuds ii also, Bose sent me these as a replacement for my QC Earbuds 1st Gen as they had developed a fault and were still under warranty, outstanding customer service from Bose. I agree regarding the ANC it's brilliant had them on at the GYM and all I could hear was my music on Quiet Mode, I also tried them on a train and could still hear the announcements during quieter parts while listening too music but people talking etc couldn't hear anything. The fit of these is excellent they don't seem to budge at all while at the GYM or moving around the best fit for me is the medium tips and the No.2 stability bands. As for the sound they have a lot of bass and the music is very detailed but for me I find them a bit bright in the high frequencies with then causes the vocals too sound distorted. I've tried all ear tips and bands and the Bose Music App is telling me I've got a good seal on both earbuds unsure how accurate it is though, the tips seem too be going in quite far as when I take them out they seem too be sitting in my ear canal don't think the seal is an issue and the ANC seems too be effective. Overall I'm happy with them just I find the sound is a little bright at times in the high frequencies."
2023-02-10,"The ‚Äònoise floor‚Äô drove me nuts, when you hear it, you can‚Äôt ever not hear it. Had to send mine back."
2023-06-24,"I just ordered a set of these and await their arrival. I've read great reviews and mad reviews - when something has to fit personally I think some folks don't quite get it, and others don't really know how Bluetooth works and how it doesn't work. That said, I am hoping for the best as I have a pair of the ""Sport"" buds and they've been pretty good (no ANC though). I want the ANC primarily, believe it or not, for mowing the lawn and for woodworking. Saw a review where another woodworker actually said he couldn't hear his table saw or planer (planers are hideously loud!) so if it cancels that noise, it'll be worth the three bills."
2023-09-18,"Just bought in 2 months before, wanted to sell or return ever since.

Worst product purchased, connectivity is very bad, sometimes the left earbud does not get connected. 

Issue when listening to music specifically the coding beats, sometimes crack noise comes in. 

Not comfortable for wearing long hours.

I had a better experience using Google Pixel Buds with 1/3rd the price and missing out of course the noise cancelling.

I had a better experience using Google Pixel Buds with 1/3rd the price and missing out of course the noise canceling, not sure what these Youtubers test it out."
2024-01-20,"Build quality is so much worse than 1st gen. One bud constantly refuse to connect, this product is bad enough for me to abandon Bose entirely."
2022-11-19,"I think you might be using the wrong app. Bose Connect and Bose Music are different apps. The one you are using, Bose Connect, only works with older products. All of Bose's newer products require you to download and install Bose Music, which is a new app for the newer products.

Hope this helps! Let me know :)"
2022-11-19,"Hmm, regarding your first point, I've had that happen maybe once or twice but it's very rare for me. 

Yea, the charging is obviously not ideal. I don't understand but it seems like based on their market research they concluded that wireless charging wasn't important/significant enough for the majority of users.

But despite all these cons, I still think it's a very very solid product and I don't regret buying it."
2023-02-12,"For me the ANC goes nuts whenever I take the bus, it sounds like a gunshot going off in my ear whenever it goes over a bump."
2023-12-19,"per 1), that is actually a feature you can turn on / off somewhere in the settings."
2022-11-20,"Yes, I mentioned it briefly in the Features section that the mic quality is not good. It is most definitely inferior to AirPods. If you take a lot of phone calls, it might be better to stick with AirPods Pro 2. Bose prioritised Sound Quality/Noise Cancellation/Comfort with these earbuds. Especially if you are taking phone calls in loud environments constantly, the mic performs poorly compared to Apple.

Yes, I do use iOS and macOS."
2023-08-10,"I am still struggling to find a mute option, I dont think there is one"
2023-04-27,could you hear engine noises with anc on?
2023-02-11,"Maybe you got faulty ones? There's always some ""floor"" noise, but once in older model I also go a laud one. Luckily it wasn't my first headphones from bose, so I suspected something was wrong. They send me a new pair and the new ones were fine."
2022-12-08,"Oh, a belated thank you!  I just now got back around to trying the app in case of updates, and maybe looking at a EQ adjustment.  I eventually got it connected through plain Bluetooth, but I just got the Bose Music app now which worked.  :)"
2022-11-19,I have zero regrets buying mine either. I feel like the ANC artifacts are something that can be solved in software.
2022-11-20,"Ah, right, you did mention it.

&#x200B;

>Yes, I do use iOS and macOS.

AirPods allow relatively seamless transition between an iPhone and a Mac. I'm guessing that in case of QCE II you simply have to connect to them manually from within iPhone/Mac whenever you switch between the two, right?"
2022-12-08,"Glad to hear that! Yea, EQ function is really dope in the app.

Also, you will need the app to install firmware updates, which will definitely be useful in the future!"
2022-11-20,"That's correct. I just click connect on either my iPhone or Mac and it connects very quickly (less than 2 seconds usually).

It is a bummer that they don't have multipoint but it's alright for me."
2022-11-20,"Thanks. So since you stick to QCE II, it means you simply don't make that many calls over the earbuds, correct? But if you do, did your listener ever complain about the poor mic quality?"
2022-11-20,"No one has complained about the poor mic quality, but I only take phone calls in relatively quiet environments. 

I also recorded myself using the QC Earbuds 2's mic and played it back- it sounds very compressed.

For majority of calls/video meetings, I use the mic on my MacBook Pro 16."
2022-11-27,"I just got QC Earbuds 2 today and they finally stay firmly within my ears - will definitely get rid of AirPods now!

The only thing that I found surprising was that QC Earbuds 2 are larger in reality than on photos like these: [https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/\_nc3/Bose\_QuietComfort\_Earbuds\_II\_1661166935\_0\_0.png](https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc3/Bose_QuietComfort_Earbuds_II_1661166935_0_0.png)"
2022-11-27,"Hope you are enjoying them! The sound quality is truly insane - a huge step up from Bose's previous products.

Well, regarding the size, I suppose they have to be large enough to fit securely within the outer ear, in combination with the ""stability bands"". But they look SO much more elegant and refined compared to the ubiquitous AirPods (in my opinion)"
2022-11-27,">The sound quality is truly insane - a huge step up from Bose's previous products.

Unfortunately, I'm not that kind of an audiophile to be able to tell the difference right away :( For example I don't see that much of a difference between QC Earbuds 2 and NC700, unless it's like comparing apples to oranges in case those two. ANC might be a bit better on QC Earbuds 2 than on APP2, though."
2024-08-17,I am not familiar with QC buds 2. However the QC ultra buds with the latest update have been excellent for me. Except mic quality.
2024-08-17,"100% agree. I‚Äôd had a few other pairs of Bose I loved. These hurt my ears after half an hour. I hate the case, they disconnect. They are basically a huge disappointment"
2024-08-17,Yeah gave mine back after 5 days of use because of crazy connection issues
2024-08-17,"I had the ultra for a week and the constant Bluetooth disconnections drove me mad in the end!

Returned to amazon for full refund, I really wanted to love these buds, the comfort and anc is the best I've known, but what's the point if they keep disconnecting??

Very disappointed, but for balance I have the qc45 and they have been faultless for over a year now and I use them everyday for 10 hours plus.

I just think that bose can't handle this small form factor?

 I ended up with the linkbuds s and they are seriously good and ¬£120!"
2024-08-17,"I feel that the QC ultra are the same, sound seems to be distorted at higher volumes. The Yamaha EP-E70A which I bought for half the price is much better in terms of sound quality, and connection.

Also those yamaha EP-E70A are 3-4 years old now, but still produce a robust sound."
2024-08-17,That's why you buy them on sale
2024-08-17,They know this already and will automatically replace them with Ultras under warranty return. Email Bose for a warranty claim.
2024-08-17,So disappointed with them. Liked the sound quality but I only really wear them when running and there was a popping sound randomly happening when my feet hit the ground. Also phone calls sucked. The other person couldn‚Äôt hear me.
2024-08-17,"I bought them last month and find the connectivity issues are slowly smoothing out. The noise cancelling is almost as good as my XM5 headphones, and I find myself dangerously unsuspecting to traffic walking around New York. Sound quality is very good as typical, also. Overall, still consider them high quality and merit the high price."
2024-08-18,I have the Bose qc ultra earbuds and they work well with the latest update I do say that the original Bose qc earbuds were amazing and I had no bugs with them at all
2024-08-19,"I have those and the Ultra Earbuds, I like the ultra's better because better sound and noise cancelling, and I wished they at least could've made the earbuds last longer so I ain't like every 6 hours, to me feels like minutes, into the case over and over. I would've bought the Sony's but I heard software and battery issues were all over their earbuds. So I bought Bose and kinda regretting it, because Bose has horrible software, disconnects and one earbud is delayed than the other, which is annoying. But the ANC is perfect, for me at least, as of now. And Sony Xm5 earbuds I heard they had good ANC, probably as good as Bose or a little better? But the Sony's earbuds itself lasts 8 hours and the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds last 6 hours. So I'm thinking of buying Sony, possibly."
2024-08-17,"Bought it on May 2024. Now my right earbuds constantly voices low and high , and sometimes it cannot sync with the left one. Consequently,  the speed of the sound are unpaired. I reported it to the customer service. I hope they really resolve it or replace it with a new pair.

In addition,  the product gift you an addicted mosquito with 3D sound which claimed as hardware issue and will never been imitated. 
 
Ahhhhh!! Will never buy this brand again!!

‚†Ä"
2024-08-17,The sound on the Bose sport is much better than these.
2024-08-18,I went through four replacement sets before just asking for a refund. So many little issues. Love the sound tho :/
2025-03-03,Ive had nothing but pleasure listening withband using these new qc2 earbuds
2025-03-03,Ive had nothing but smooth sailing with the new qc2 earbuds. I love them
2024-08-17,"BREAKING NEWS ‚ÄºÔ∏è Fish found swimming in the ocean!



Seriously it ain't your fault. Bose fell off so hard"
2024-08-17,I have the ultras too and really like them
2024-08-18,"Them making your ears hurt is completely subjective. No iems will ever fit everyone comfortably unfortunately.   I'm not saying it doesn't suck you're one of a few that they don't work well for but it doesn't make them ""bad"". I've returned quite a few iems because I have really weird inner ear structure and they weren't bad, QC Ultras just seem to fit ok/well for whatever reason.

I belive the newest update fixed most of the connection issues and added multipoint, not yeah they're not prefect. The ANC in these makes my XM5s sound like $50 buds with ANC. From a sound perspective they're both fantastic, ANC is vastly different."
2024-08-18,How‚Äôs the noise cancelling on these? I‚Äôm looking to replace my Bose as well
2024-08-17,The device I used all the time? No way!
2024-08-17,Even if I am out of warranty??
2024-08-17,They arent meant for running
2024-08-17,I have the ultras and omg they are so glitchy. Worst Bose product I‚Äôve ever owned. Their support doesn‚Äôt even try to listen to issues. They just offer to send new unit
2024-08-19,Agreed on the ears thing but that is compounded by the other issues. They are in my subjective view a much poorer offering than in the past.
2024-08-18,"Not as good as Bose, but it does the job. There is E7B which is a better option from yamaha"
2024-08-17,No. They will make you pay for a refurbished but give you a credit. That's what happened with my Bose Sport. I'm leaving the brand.
2024-08-17,You can check your credit card if they double the warranty period. Most do
2024-08-17,Well they dumped their sport line so you should be able to use them for that.
2024-08-17,Which ones are? Other users said they had the same issues walking or on a bus going over bumps. Also where does it say they not meant for running? Curious about that.
2024-08-17,I also got a new unit after issues.
2023-12-17,if Bose had good software they would be king again. love Sony though those always connect and don't have the Bose issues.
2023-12-17,"They‚Äôre worth $1. Absolute worst. Every time I went to use them it was 1-2 minutes to get them to work. Imagine if google was 1-2 minutes per search.

Thankfully they fucking broke after 1 year. I feel like Bose stole money from me. Never touching that piece of shirt company again."
2023-12-17,"Keep in mind I only use them on Android phones but these are the ""rituals"" I go to to try to keep the initial connection as bug-free as possible with these.

I only pull the right bud out of the case first, and keep it close to the case while waiting for it to connect. I need to hear the *vvwhooop!* sound before I put in the left bud, which can take like 5 seconds.... 1- Mississippi 2- Mississippi 3- Mississippi....

To minimize the excessive ANC white noise I also rub my fingers over the top mic until the scratching sound stops (ANC kicks in) 

Keep the case close by until the connection! There have been times I popped the buds in and walked away from the case like they are regular ear buds and I've had problems (big problems)

When finished using, put them back in the case right bud first. I tried putting left bud back into the case first a couple times and again bizarre bugs. 

Even with all this still sometimes goes awry. But these are the tricks that mostly work for me"
2023-12-17,Same issues.  Go through support and send them back.  They'll replace with the Ultras.  Hopefully those aren't as trash.
2023-12-18,I had connection issues.  I contacted bose and they sent me the ultras as replacement.  No issues so far.
2023-12-17,"Finger crossed 

So far I used on my iPhone for almost a week and nothing happen yet
And I gave it to my partner on her android and it was working great too

Not sure if something happen later but so far am good"
2023-12-17,"When I‚Äôve had connections issues, they‚Äôve typically been when the battery is low, especially in the case. If I charge my buds completely, I typically find connectivity issues to be less common until the battery starts to get very low again. Perhaps see if you find something similar. If so, the ‚Äúfix‚Äù would be to charge your buds and case more often that you are used to."
2024-05-16,"I am going to write down some things that improved the User Experience for me with my Bose QC 2s:  
- I put the bud or buds in the case as soon as i remove them from my ears.  
- I make sure the Bose app is not installed on my phone at all times  
  
These 2 steps alone seem to get the job done most of the time. But, i noticed that when the case's battery is almost completely discharded  then returning the buds ASAP to the case when not in use is not enough. As soon as i charge the case then the sync issues are gone.  

As always, YMMV but, for me, these steps seem to work.

Also, for those of you that haven't tried wavelet app already, please do (i think this only works on android). The sound quality improved dramatically after i installed this app and configured it properly with the correct profile for Bose QC 2..."
2023-12-17,"Although not quite to this extreme I had a similar experience. Be sure to check that the firmware has been updated. I‚Äôd say don‚Äôt use them at all until confirmed up to date via the Bose app. I found most of my issues were caused by interference with the update happening while I was using the earbuds (although there should be safeguards to stop update transfers while in use, but I digress)"
2024-03-07,"Couldn't agree more.  These things are absolutely terrible.  They don't connect 50% of the time and they have to be perfectly place in the case in order to charge.  DO NOT BUY THESE THINGS.

Also all of their products have hundreds of reviews with star ratings and pictures on their website but there's no way to actually leave a review.   I even chatted in to ask how to leave a review like that and they said you can't.  They're all fake reviews haha.  Fucking bullshit from Bose."
2024-04-16,I‚Äôm a bass player so I love the way Bose ‚Äú hears‚Äù bass. There is no competition. I have the QC2 and they worked fine for about a month. Then connection issues started and have gotten to a ridiculous point of disconnecting then announcing better levels after disconnecting the reconnecting. My phone has forgotten the device so many times it‚Äôs depressing. It happens daily and many times. I guess Bose wants you to stop every thing you‚Äôre doing and troubleshoot .. all day long! I‚Äôm gonna try to call them but even if they replace my $300 earbuds I fear connection issues are a feature not a bug with Bose. I wish I could recommend another brand. I had Sony‚Äôs prior but Bose had the best sound for me. I‚Äôm thinking about getting over the ear headphones and losing these expensive shitty earbuds. Don‚Äôt buy this crap!
2024-09-11,"They work perfectly fine with my OnePlus 7 Pro. Connect immediately every time.

My original SSF have constant connectivity issues (sometimes not connecting or the left bud dropping out.)

The ANC on the QCB2 is insane. It's the only IEM I can bike with. They all have way too much wind noise."
2023-12-17,"Before they broke, I would typically open the case and wait a few seconds before removing the earbuds and putting them on. They would, of course, disconnect periodically and I'd have to put them back in the case and do the same thing over again from time to time..."
2023-12-18,I don't have them. Have you tried using the Bose app to pair? Which of their apps do you have?
2023-12-18,Maybe your device is DOA. I don‚Äôt ever really have issues with
2023-12-18,"Man I had a lot of problems with QC Ultra earbuds (2023), such a shame considering the price"
2023-12-18,"I was super hopeful at first the first week then the pairing issues started occurring. I even commented to other people here having the connection issues to keep hope and wait for an update because the sound and NC was just too good.. a week later no update from BOSE. I didn't want to wait weeks for my new earbuds to come in meanwhile I had to send the ones I was using to them for a replacement.

Sadly, I gave it a few more tries and resets. Then I returned and grabbed a pair of Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC for $100 cheaper and couldn't be more happy... even though Bose had superior NC. Before the Bose I tried the Sony XM5's and had a problem not being able to simply log in to access the app. Pretty sad how these big companies get so much traction from decent products, and then eventually it just gets completely washed down and neglected because they're doing too much; like releasing the 'Ultra's."
2023-12-18,My connectivity issues went away when I started inserting them into my ears simultaneously instead of one then the other.
2023-12-18,"I had the same issue‚Ä¶ over, and over and over again.  I had Bose warranty me 4 different pairs.  Finally, I just asked for my money back, and they offered to send me some QC Ultra headphones instead."
2023-12-18,"I got the qc1 earbuds for half price and had a lot of goofy issues. They completely died at 13 months but Bose sent me the qc2 earbuds anyway. Literally nothing but problems every time I use them. For every step they took forward they took at least 1 backwards. The case is smaller but no longer shows the charge level. The earbuds are smaller but have a worse fit. They sound better and have better anc but occasionally anc ‚Äòblips‚Äô and completely changes the sound for 2 seconds. Or they just flat don‚Äôt connect for no apparent reason and I have to remove them and add them to my phone again. 

Even though I‚Äôm on my second pair for only 50% of the original cost I‚Äôm contemplating just buying something else that works consistently. It‚Äôs super frustrating."
2023-12-18,Mine have a really light static in the left ear constantly
2023-12-18,Yes! Mine stopped working in the left earbud after 4 months of gentle use. The same thing happened with the eb1s!
2023-12-18,"As you say you use an iPhone and IF you don‚Äôt mind not using the Bose app; a solution is to remove the Bluetooth access to the Bose app: settings> privacy and security> Bluetooth> touch button next to Bose. 
You might as well remove the app itself too as it can‚Äôt work and will keep prompting you for Bluetooth access."
2023-12-18,"I had nothing but problems pairing mine every single time I used them. If they were cheaper I would have thrown them at a brick wall, I was so frustrated. 
I called customer service and they‚Äôre going to replace them with the QC ultras. I sent them back a week ago but so far they have sent the new ones out yet. I‚Äôm hopeful about the Ultras."
2023-12-18,"QC1 broke after 13 months. Got QC2 as a replacement, left earbud completely dead after 1 month..."
2023-12-18,"Dang I never have had a single issue with my earbuds. Bought mine a month ago from the bose refurb store for $150 and I am very impressed. They connect right away to both my iPhone and Mac and when I want to play around with the settings in the app, they are recognized instantly. Audio quality is S tier and noise cancelling is S tier. Hope nothing happens to my pair cuz rn they are my favorite piece of tech."
2023-12-19,"Take them back to where you got them. They should replace them with a pair of ultras. I have QC 2 and they lasted 2 days in my possession. Useless, don‚Äôt connect. Dog shit product. Ultras seem okay, every now and again one bud drops out but seems to fix it self. Probably won‚Äôt go Bose again, might move over to Sony."
2023-12-19,Mine just started unpairing this week. Every time I pull them out I have reset them. Today they totally failed. Bluetooth connects then disconnects 2 seconds later and repeats.
2023-12-21,Contact Bose and they‚Äôll replace them with a pair of ultras
2023-12-27,"For everyone commenting negatively about the **Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II**, did you buy them direct from Bose, from a big box store (like Best Buy), from Amazon, or from somewhere else?   I may pursue getting Ultra replacements, but I bought my new buds on Amazon (from a 3rd party) and I'm not sure if I am eligible to get anything straight from Bose.  And I'm probably even less likely to get any satisfaction from the party that sold them to me via Amazon.  Can y'all please give me some input?    Thanks in advance!"
2023-12-17,I‚Äôll definitely try this. I‚Äôm on iPhone but I have noticed you need to wait on the right earbud before the left. What usually happens is it‚Äôll connect. Sound will start playing but then it basically mutes. Not playing through earbuds nor iPhone but my phone thinks it‚Äôs playing through headphones. I am guessing the issues are due to separate connections but who knows
2023-12-18,You're not ready ahaha
2023-12-18,Did you just contact the live support? Or send an email? I‚Äôm having this same issue and it‚Äôs frustrating
2023-12-18,Same.
2023-12-27,">before

Did you buy them directly from Bose?   I may pursue this action as well, but I bought mine (new) on Amazon, as I had many Amazon gift cards to burn - and they were on sale.   Thanks in advance for your input..."
2023-12-17,Got it. Let me try that as well. Otherwise idk if they will last when I finally spike these into the ground
2023-12-18,I think this is helping. With the combination of removing the nose apps I haven‚Äôt had issues.
2023-12-27,"Stupid question, but how does one go about updating firmware, or at least checking whether or not firmware needs to be updated?"
2023-12-18,"I would tap my case 3 times, count to 3 then open. Once opened take out right earbud and place in right ear, count to 3 then do the same with the left earbud. Tap the left earbud 3 times to change mode then swip up on right earbud to increase volume. Easy peasy, I jest!"
2023-12-18,I was using the Bose music app to connect. I removed that and just used the normal Bluetooth function and they‚Äôve been working.

2023-12-18,"Chat worked for me, just waiting for a tracking number now."
2023-12-27,"I used the Bose app on my iPhone. When connected to your earphones, you go to Settings (cog wheel at the top-right) and the Product Update second option is what you want."
2023-12-18,Good bot
2023-12-18,"Suprisingly the bose app hasn't really given me trouble. Sure, it isn't as seamless as my old airpods 2nd generation but no non-apple earbud/headphone is gonna be as seamless as apple branded ones on iOS. My family has been buying bose audio gear for the last 20+ years and we have had 0 troubles."
2023-12-18,"When you receive them, make sure to update them on the latest firmware version (1.7.6)"
2023-12-19,I‚Äôve used Bose for about a decade and never had these issues. Only happened when I got these. Even the sound sport wireless headphones I had for years never had an issue.
2023-12-19,I think I might have jinxed myself after this comment. I just had my first connection issue where the buds refused to connect to both my iPhone and my Macbook and I had to forget the device and repair. Repair was also buggy. It took a couple of tries to pair it again. F. I might return these and just buy the Airpods Pro even though they are probably a worse fit in my ears and have overall inferior audio technology
2024-04-20,"Sorry, but they are terrible."
2024-04-20,Posted this many times here. File a warranty claim and get free upgrade to Ultras. Then make sure you have the latest firmware. Don‚Äôt delay. Get it done. Keep receipts of everything and absolutely get tracked shipping. They have a tendency to ‚Äúlose‚Äù stuff per some reports here.
2024-04-21,"I have ultras and QC 1s. I find if I wait a second between taking them out of the case and putting them in my ears, it seems to connect more reliably. Has anyone else found this?"
2024-04-21,I wish I never got the Quiet Comfort 2. I didn't want the apple because they didn't look comfortable. I've had them for less than a year and the right one just up and died and won't reset. I will never buy another Bose product.
2024-04-21,Bose over the ear or bust
2024-04-20,Maybe it's you
2024-04-21,Reset them
2024-04-21,Ye I sent mine back currently waiting to get the ultras as replacements
2024-04-21,"Great NC, but mine are always having connectivity problems, particularly if I put them in before I leave the house! Disappointing."
2024-04-21,Don't blame Bose. Apple just don't want you to use 3rd party headphones. They want you to buy AirPods Max.
2024-04-22,"Yeah, apple purposefully designs their software like that."
2024-04-24,Wait till you require service support ‚Ä¶.. Horrible is very polite‚Ä¶
2024-04-25,"Get airpods. It‚Äòs the only solution for iphone and other apple devices that works seamlessly.

P.S.: I have similar problems with my sony over ear headphones. The pairing is very annoying."
2024-04-20,"That doesn't sound right. I know there are some issues with older Mac's and OS versions, but you shouldn't have this many issues with trying to connect to an iPhone."
2024-04-20,you're an Apple user and shouldn't use non Apple devices. 90% of issues reported here are from Apple users and it's really annoying because this is not an Apple support sub
2024-04-20,Maybe it‚Äôs you
2024-04-20,Please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but isn‚Äôt the latest update only for the app and not for the actual headphones. I have the qc ultra earbuds reason I ask. Did the last update and zero improvement.
2024-04-20,i tried this to upgrade to ultras but got no luck on my end
2024-11-05,"Sorry to ask this of you again but can you share how did you filed the claim ?  
Is it only a country specific thing or global ?"
2024-04-21,Still better than most other brands. At least Bose has a very good warranty policy and customer service so they always stand behind their products.
2024-04-22,"It's an apple issue, not a bose issue."
2024-04-22,Apple users will never admit this.
2024-04-21,(Not OP) I only switched to apple in January and had issues all the time with getting my earbuds to connect to my MSI laptop and my galaxy s22 ultra. It would randomly drop BT connection on my phone and would act as if it couldn‚Äôt find the product to reconnect.
2024-04-21,"100% BS. This is all on Bose. Earbuds from Jabra and Sony perform fine with iPhones, as do others. Bose released a buggy product. Hell, they even target iPhone users by only supporting SBC and AAC with most of their headphones and earbuds. It wasn‚Äôt until the Ultra series when they haphazardly added Snapdragon Sound for aptX lossless (which isn‚Äôt supported in every Android phone)."
2024-04-20,There were two updates: one several months ago for the firmware and a very recent one for the app
2024-04-22,Yeah I got the ultra's through Amazon 2 weeks ago and I'm about to return them. Shame they do sound good and art comfortable + secure. But I have lots of issues with the app working. Whenever my case gets down to steady orange light 30-% battery remaining my headphones will not charge past 50 percent also sometimes  one or both earbuds will not connect to my device. I also know a lot of people complain about the spatial audio I think it's cool for shows and movies.
2024-04-21,Why not?
2024-11-05,Should be global. I found the phone number for Bose service and called them. If they won‚Äôt address the issue then your credit card might. Most credit cards double the manufacturer warranty up to 2 years total.
2024-04-23,They are replacing them with the Ultra. I'll see how they work.
2024-04-22,I have the same issues with my PC.
2024-05-03,No it's a Bose issue. Have it with my iPhone and Windows PC.
2024-11-07,It's 100% a Bose issue. The hardware is garbage.
2024-04-22,iSheeps
2024-04-21,maybe the earbuds anticipated the switch to Apple products
2024-04-22,BS Apple has a very long track record of this
2024-04-23,"Can you describe the ""haphazardly added Snapdragon Sound for aptX lossless (which isn‚Äôt supported in every Android phone)"" bit please? I ordered the ultra headphones but don't know if they're made to last long enough to justify the heavy price tag, so any details would be appreciated"
2024-04-20,Got it. Will look into it. Thanks!
2024-04-23,Don't blame ya tbh. I still use mine daily due to comfort but in all honesty these aren't worth the price with how many issues they have. I'm on the latest updates for both headphones and app as well as have tried completely deleting and using the earbuds without the app(helps a bit I think) but still far too many issues. Biggest of all is constant dropped bluetooth connection.
2024-04-21,"idk if it was the agent who i spoken to
or the fact i tried with my QC35II's. these got out of warranty in 2020/2022? this model had power led issues and some could upgrade. but the agent who spoke to me asked for a upgrade token that i didnt have soü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
2024-04-21,Lol üòÇ I‚Äôve had them for over a year. I love the sound quality but unfortunately it seems to be pretty common for them to have frequent connectivity issues
2024-04-22,"The issues people have with AirPods is not as long or extensive as those of the QC earbuds 1 and 2, two products that should have never been released in their state."
2024-04-23,"You need a phone that supports the new Snapdragon Sound specs. The Ultra earbuds and headphones do not support standard aptX or anything other than aptX Adaptive with lossless support. Have a Pixel phone? Tough, you get SBC or AAC. Have a Galaxy phone? Kick rocks, you get the same as Pixel phones.

Other earbuds and headphones, like the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4, will drop down to other aptX standards or AAC. You can pick what you want in the phone‚Äôs settings and Sennheiser‚Äôs app. Bose‚Äôs app also doesn‚Äôt tell you what quality the earbuds or headphones are using.

It all just feels like an afterthought. Great ANC, but terrible implementation of aptX adaptive/lossless. Might as well get Sony headphones if you want higher quality Bluetooth since their LDAC codec is baked into Android and part of its standard."
2024-04-30,I've had the Technics for 4 days now. They're good comporable but harder to use touch controls and not as comfortable for me so far. I'ma give em another week or so try diff tips to see if my ears could adjust. I was considering the momentums next I just don't like there fabric case lolz I'll be getting white to try if I return these technics. Bose needs to get there stuff together it's amazing when it works and I got mines new for 250.
2024-04-23,Thank you so much for explaining - had no idea about this. My older iPhone SE is not going to work with these then after all
2024-04-23,"It will 100% work with them, you‚Äôll just be ‚Äústuck‚Äù using AAC for Bluetooth audio. AAC on iOS devices, like iPhones, is perfectly fine. Apple‚Äôs AAC encoder is the best out there and is able to provide perceptual transparency at bitrates used for Bluetooth transmission. AAC on Android is a mess.

The reason why the Ultra won‚Äôt work with aptX on your iPhone is not because of Bose, it‚Äôs due to Apple. iPhones only transmit AAC and SBC audio, that‚Äôs it. Apple has them locked down. You could get Sony headphones and you‚Äôll be stuck using AAC. No LDAC or anything else. Like I said, it‚Äôs fine for iPhones. It just becomes a mess if you‚Äôre on Android."
2024-04-25,"Okay that's more complicated that I initially understood it to be. Thank you for explaining again.

Are there any phones that use aptX adaptive lossless? It's odd that they would start using Snapdragon if it's so glitchy and such few Androids can work with it."
2024-04-25,"Snapdragon chips are great for Bluetooth on any device. It‚Äôs Bose‚Äôs firmware that‚Äôs glitchy. There‚Äôs a list of Snapdragon Sound phones on Qualcomm‚Äôs website. It‚Äôs essentially any modern Android that isn‚Äôt made by Google or Samsung. Samsung uses Qualcomm‚Äôs SoCs in the US and internationally (at least they did for the S24 series) but they locked out support for Snapdragon Sound and instead support their own Samsung Scalable Codec for their earbuds.

Have a look on Qualcomm‚Äôs website. Even then, it‚Äôs not worth getting a phone just for aptX lossless. AAC is great on Apple devices and, really, nobody is going to hear the difference between AAC and aptX lossless in volume-matched blind ABX tests using whatever AAC encoder an Android phone relies on (it varies based on manufacturer)."
2024-04-26,"Okay, thanks so much for explaining again :)"
