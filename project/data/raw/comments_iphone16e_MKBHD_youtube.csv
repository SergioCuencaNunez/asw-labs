2025-02-25,"It’s like this phone isn’t even designed to be sold as an actual product, just designed to make the more expensive iPhones look like better deals"
2025-02-25,The intro summarised everything perfectly.
2025-02-25,"That intro / outro was spot-on. ""Who ARE you?"""
2025-03-06,Im still on an iPhone 11 Pro Max. It refuses to die on me and still fulfils most of my use cases. Best iPhone I have ever owned.
2025-02-25,All they had to do was not remove magsafe and price it at $499.
2025-02-25,I hate higher refresh rate is wild
2025-02-25,MoustacheKBHD needs to make more appearances
2025-03-06,"It's old school concession marketing. Go to the movies, small popcorn for $3 or large popcorn $4. You buy the large because you're already spending $3 so why not spend a dollar more. It works in a movie theater cause you don't have any other choices, and it works for Apple consumers, because if you want it to be an Apple product, then you don't have any other choices either."
2025-02-25,"""Nobody ever asks for that."" After Apple Intelligence couldnt be more real."
2025-03-06,iPhone 16e is like the small popcorns and small icees at movie theaters that try to make the medium and large options look like better deals
2025-03-06,this 16e at $599 is just a setup for future price rising of a base iPhone model to $899
2025-03-06,DBrand ad was so smooth I almost didn't notice it. More creators need to be doing this... Good on you bruh
2025-02-25,The intro was absolute cinema
2025-02-25,"1 camera, no MagSafe and $599 for a budget iPhone in 2025 is crazy"
2025-02-25,iPhone 16 e waste edition?
12  ago,I wish they would have just released an iPhone 16 Mini instead. I don't get why Apple doesn't believe there's a market for smaller phones.
2025-02-25,That intro skit is the LIFE of a sales rep in the phone industry. You captured our struggles perfectly
2025-03-06,"I remember when this was for the top of the line flagship phone price.  

Looks like my upgrade cycles will continue to be ever 5-7 years."
2025-03-06,The trajectory of iPhones lately has me wanting to just keep my 13 Pro until it literally dies.
2025-03-13,EPIC INTRO LMAO THE HEAD NOD
2025-02-25,That intro was TOP TIER. I love the skit.
2025-03-06,The default phone with every new business contract. THAT is what this iPhone is for.
2025-03-06,My guess is that in apple’s mind the “e” stands for essentials - the only problem that the essentials are a 600$ price tag
2025-03-13,"The people who buy this phone aren’t interested in MagSafe, Dynamic Island and fancy cameras. They just want a stripped down iPhone with long battery life. That’s exactly what the iPhone 16e is. It certainly doesn’t suffer an identity crisis. In fact, this  Zen-like, gimmick free iPhone is probably the one that Steve Jobs would use if he was still with us."
2025-02-25,It's very easy to Apple make the 16e more affordable. Just need to raise the prices for the next generations of the regular ones.
2025-02-25,"Remember when you bought a new thing, and it was better than the old thing? Wild times"
2025-02-25,"I lowkey agree with Marques on how this phone is just a sneaky way to increase sales for the regular iPhone 16. Cause there are features here that the iPhone 15 doesn't have (ai, action button) but missing things that the iPhone 15 does have (MagSafe, ultra wide band, dynamic island and double cameras). So for most reasonable buyers who want the best of both worlds, the iPhone 16 is just there to balance all those desires. truly a strange product"
6  ago,The nods at 1:25
2025-02-25,We got MKBHD doing theatre before GTA6!
2025-02-25,That intro was incredible.
2025-02-25,"this is by FAR the best depiction of this phone. i was tired of hearing mixed views on this phone, when there's objectively only one answer."
2025-03-06,"I remember when this was the price of the top-tier flagship phone.  

It appears that my upgrade cycles will continue to occur every 5-7 years."
2025-02-25,Marques with a thick stache make him look like he’s Steve Harvey’s son
2025-03-06,"Just traded in my teenage son's iPhone SE 3rd gen for $150 trade in credit. Initially, I thought I would get him a new ""SE,"" but it wasn't released in time for his birthday earlier this month. I ended up getting him an Iphone14 for less than the 16E, and he is happy with it."
2025-02-25,Ok i liked the video just after seeing those mustache     0:10
2025-03-06,01:29 that Head Movement
2025-03-06,"I still firmly believe they should've put it in the body of the 13 Mini to bring back the small iPhone, during my time working for T-Mobile the amount of people who wanted a new Mini was astonishing"
2025-02-25,Rare sighting of MKBHD's lesser known cousin MKB4K in the intro
2025-03-06,By far the best intro you’ve done. Really emphasized the fact this phone is something no one asked for
2  ago,That mustache tho
2025-02-25,THIS INTRO WAS SO FIRE
2025-02-25,That intro sketch was amazing lol
2025-02-25,The intro is absolutely dope

2025-02-25,That intro was cold
2025-03-06,"iPhone XR, Recycled and Updated. ️️"
2025-03-06,Just one word for the introduction. ART.
2  ago,I like how your ad was integrated the video so smoothly
2025-02-25,"The saddest thing about this phone is not the single camera, nor the 60HZ, nor even the missing Magsafe.

It's that people exist that'd actually buy it."
2025-02-25,"Should've named it SE 4, Price should've been $499, should've had magsafe, and they should've made it smaller to stay true to the real SE for people that like smaller phones and I bet u this would've made a big seller"
2025-02-25,That intro was absolut cinema.
2025-03-06,1:28 i also hate high refresh rate got me dying
2025-02-25,"Brilliant intro, makes the point so well"
2025-02-25,The intro is crazy
2025-02-25,"Intro was  Decent acting, Marques!"
11  ago,"The Best Hook I've seen on any channel in a long time ""robin hood"" LoL"

2025-02-25,MKBHD = Mustache KBHD
2025-02-25,This is gold Marques! The intro is perfect
2025-03-06,The way bro threw it away without flinching  7:18
2025-03-06,"If anyone has seen the iPhone design team since 2017 can you let me know. They came to work for a day around 3-4 years ago and added a flat edge, it was a really revolutionary day and they haven’t been seen since"
2025-02-25,Laughing my ass off at the confident head nodding 1:30
2025-02-25,The intro- one of the best i've seen lately.
2025-03-06,whoever that mustached guy was…he understands ME!
2025-02-25,1 camera in 2025 is wild
2025-02-25,More of this style please! That intro was awesome
2025-02-25,"The best intro in an MKBHD video ever! The rest of the video is great too, very well thought out and planned video. The phone that doesn't make sense."
2025-03-06,7:20 he was holding that laugh so hard
2025-02-25,Looks like Tim Cook didn't cook with this iPhone.
2025-02-25,"Love the skit, please do more in the future!"
2025-02-25,We got thick moustache Marques before GTA VI
2025-03-13,The intro said it all
2025-02-25,Your honesty is refreshing!
2025-03-06,This intro was one of the best I have ever seen!!!
2025-02-25,Brilliant Intro and great Review!
2025-03-06,"Have you all considered enterprise customers? I am a manager at a large healthcare company, and we have purchased tens of thousands of iPhone SEs from Apple. They serve as clinical devices to communicate and page providers in the hospital and at clinics. The only requirements we have are that they get extended software updates, long periods of compatibility with the software we use, and are durable and less expensive than the main line. I suspect a lot of businesses will buy these for their workforce."
2025-03-06,The intro was a masterpiece 🫡
2025-02-25,"The 16e fits one category of buyer that isn't as needy on the camera, MagSafe or the screen refresh rate; Corporate buyers. When you are purchasing 100+ devices at a time for fleets, the saving between a 16 or 16e becomes significant. In Australia the 16e comes in cheaper than the iPhone 14 so it allows a large step up in internal performance, extended life on iOS updates and gives warm fuzzies to employees receiving the ""latest"" model. Deep down, I think Apple knows this and the ""e"" is for Enterprise."
2025-02-25,Nice of Marques's dad to help out with that skit in the beginning
4  ago,5:47 They got DOGEd

11  ago,"The fact that I've gotten so much YouTube ads about this phone, I'm wondering what's the special? Now I'm watching this guy after watched JerryRig's vid"
2025-02-25,That intro… well done.  Nailed this so well.
2025-02-25,"AT&T has a good deal on the 16e right now where with no trade-in, you get the phone for like $6/month for 36 months. That’s just over $200, which is significantly better than $600. Not sponsored, just saw the deal and went for it for my mom. She has an iPhone 11 so that was a no-brainer deal and she just pre-ordered the 16e to upgrade to. It’s good enough for what she uses and is a big upgrade over her current 11. It’s certain situations like that which make sense for the 16e."
2025-02-25,appreciate the obvious indicator for the ad - feels more honest than the typical youtube ad
2025-03-06,the aggressive head nods
2025-03-06,I love Marques starting with a skit he should do that more.
2025-03-06,"1. The iPhone 16e should be priced between $399 and $449, with a maximum of $499.
 2. They should not have removed the UW chip and MagSafe, as it impacts the Apple ecosystem.
 3. The camera should be the same as the base iPhone 16, ideally with a 1X cinematic mode if possible."
2025-02-25,"i like the 'ad' setup, letting people know that the ad started."
2025-03-13,"I am glad I found this video, I almost change my 14 for this phone. I didn’t notice about the camera thank you."
2025-02-25,(Not Boring) Weather is the app at 11:14 for everyone wondering.
2025-02-25,This intro is so good
2025-02-25,"I loved when he said: ""I hate faster refresh rate"""
2025-03-06,Your energy makes this so fun!
2025-03-06,"The intro was so good, I want to see more of those if possible"
2025-02-25,Well done on the seamless ad integration 6:56
2025-02-25,They should have used the 13 mini body
2025-03-06,"This was more fun to watch
We need more reviews like this one please"
2025-02-25,Intro skit was so good! Nice acting Marques!!
2025-03-06,"You should definitely do more skits, you’re actually really funny"
2025-02-25,A good case study is my 13 year old daughter who is running an iPhone 12 and she got excited that there could be a low cost upgrade available for her (via me of course) and at £599 it was a possible- but when she saw it had one camera she was out. That’s a 13 year old who wouldn’t have even been the one paying for it- and she’s happy to stick with an iPhone 12 ️
2025-03-06,Yooo that intro is killer  amazing production mate
2025-02-25,Love the intro by the way
2025-02-25,What an honest review.  Fantastic intro.
2025-02-25,"""The only thing wrong with this phone is its price"". Thank you! This was exactly my opinion. Up to this day I am using my iPhone SE 2020 and I was considering the new 16e.. but I was hoping for 500$. Unfortunately 600$ for THIS phone is simply too much. I waited 5 years. I can still wait a couple of months more for black friday and get the iPhone 16. The iPhone 17 will be out already and in combination with black friday I should be able to get it for 600 somewhere.

I really don't know who gave this a green light but I think this person should get fired."
2025-03-06,.... Did you put a mustache... On top of your mustache?
2025-02-25,Loved your new sketch

2025-03-06,"Intro is spot on. Not small or cheap, no audience, & unique casing w/A18 adds cost. They could’ve made another mini wo action button & the A17. If u can’t get the person an ugly sibling won’t do"
2025-02-25,I've been waiting for you review of this. Love your casting at the beginning!

11  ago,Thank you for this video.  It really helped me make a decision for my son.
2025-02-25,that intro was lit
2025-02-25,Love the skit as the intro
2025-03-06,Part of what makes the SE so great though was the thumb print sensor!  It’s great that by the time I pull out my phone from my pocket it is already open
2025-03-13,That intro was fire my guy
2025-02-25,I appreciate an honest review. Thank you.

2025-02-25,iPhone 16expired before it's even released
2025-02-25,The nodding at the end of the skit had howling
2025-02-25,Dawg 🫶 love the intro
2025-03-06,That beginning was the best thing I’ve seen bro
2025-02-25,iPhone 16e is like the (really weird) middle child.
2025-02-25,the intro “Who are you” . Can’t wait for the next vid.
2025-02-25,That Intro
2025-03-06,"Old iPhones had black, gold, and white for the main line, while the budget series featured bright shades. Now that the main line includes colors, they’ve switched to just black and white for the budget models."
2025-02-25,60 Hz in 2025 is nuts

2025-02-25,The camera on it is the same size as iPhone XR from 2018. Flat photos got a come back.
2025-03-13,"It’s for people who want the newest number, see how it’s cheaper than the 16 but has a similar name, so they buy it to say they have the newest iPhone, even if it’s worse and oddly specific in its feature set. They wouldn’t know and they wouldn’t care."
2025-02-25,"I like how Marques has a mustache but he got a fake mustache ""to differentiate the character from himself"" for the intro.
lol unrecognizable"
2025-02-25,Damn the intro was fun and dope. We need more of this.
2025-03-06,BEST 1:36 skit EVER MKBHD! NEED MORE OF THESE ASAP!
2025-03-13,The mustache is wild
2025-03-06,1:43 Apple missed the mark $599 is not a budget phone.
2025-02-25,1:34 exactly my though
2025-02-25,Thanks Marques. Definitely going for a 15 pro instead
2025-03-13,For enterprise situations we're kind of in a pickle here. The iPhone 13 replaced the SE and now 13 is not available anymore so the only option is 14 or 16e and 16e since its newer results in longer support for a symbolic price difference. So the only real option is the 16e which increases the base-line purchase price for cheapest iphone by 20-25%. When you're buying hundereds of phones on a yearly basis this sucks. The result of this is to approve less iphones in business and look harder at android options and not consider user preferences. The Samsung A55 is killing it in terms of value.
2025-03-06,I keep looking at the play till 'who are you' in loop... one of the finest pun ever made... @mkbhd - you keep upping the ante every-time... just loved the whole script.
2025-03-13,"""Who are you...."" Hi! I am Sammy. Unlike most people here on YT who care about Apple (seemingly) I actually PREFER the notch over dynamic island. I like the fact that it has one camera, it makes it look cleaner. That and no magsafe by default prevents feature overload. I don't like too many features to my Phone. I just want it to have a decent camera and good processor and now AI. I currently am on a 13 mini but plan on asking my parents for 16e this christmas. I would think of it less of a 16 downgraded or expensive SE but rather an upgraded version of the mini phones that aren't actually mini. (Small phones make my hands hurt a bit. It's very cramped. And I have small hands.)

Benefiets of 16e over something like say iPhone 13 mini:
* Better camera
* Better processor/gpu
* First Apple Cellular Modem
* Better, bigger screen
* Better battery life
* Apple Intelligence (Privacy-respecting AI.)
* USB-C (Thanks, EU!)
* Action Button
* E-Sim Only (secure!)
* Free sattelite service for 2 years.
* Costs about as much the 13 mini did at launch but it's WAY better now
* Newer updates in the long run because the phone is newer."
2025-03-06,60hz display for a 599 phone should be punishable by imprisonment
2025-02-25,"More skits, this was funny"
2025-02-25,Love the intro. Point well made.
2025-03-06,"It's me! I am switching from a very old android phone and i think it should be apple because I'm hopeful that Apple AI will be able to run locally.
The only important things for me are
1. AI performance (+1 generational performance)
2. Battery life
3. Length of service updates (+1 year expected)

I don't care at all about the quality of the screen nor the cameras. And i would prefer the phone to be as small as possible"
2025-02-25,Super hilarious introduction
2025-03-06,"The 15pro is still ~1000 USD in the Philippines.

The 16e and the base 14 are both at ~600 USD here so 16e is the better choice. I think they're trying to penetrate the Asian market where mid-range, pay-in-full phones are king"
2025-03-06,Thanks for the refurbished 15pro suggestion!
2025-03-13,Bro!! The mustache works!!!!

2025-03-06,I enjoyed the sketch at the beginning
2025-03-06,Best intro yet
2025-03-06,"Damn that’s the one of the best intro ever, short yet clear and summarize everything you need to know. 
Been an Apple fan since the iPod nano day, never thought someday I could be so disgusted with this company I used to love. Tim Cook may be one the greatest business manager ever, but he also killed the soul of the old Apple. It’s really becoming just a money printing machine for the investors now, everything is only with profit in mind, not the customers, not the users, zero risk and no vision. What a shame."
2025-03-06,Your best video in recent times.
2025-02-25,7:19 The fact he just chucks the phone away

2025-02-25,No Dynamic Island on an iPhone 16? No mag safe? 1 camera? Does apple think we’re stupid????
2025-02-25,Very clever ad placement. Kudos.
2025-03-06,That intro was way better than iphone 16e launch

2025-03-06,Great stuff man! Loved that intro just shows how ridiculous this phone is.
2025-02-25,7:19 lol that throw
2025-02-25,12:24 So Apple cheaped out on everything but their profit cut
2025-02-25,Absolutely brilliant opening!
2025-03-13,"I'm back. I've been using this phone since the day I received it via delivery on Feb 28, 2025. I like it. It gives me what I want without forcing what I don't need. I'm the person this phone was made for. Got a couple hundred knocked off the price, too. It's a good deal so far. And no, I do not work for and have never worked for Apple. But now I'm considering leaving Windows for a Mac."
2025-03-06,throwing the phone 7:19

2025-02-25,"I am pretty sure the iPhone 16e, is a bait-and-switch prop to eventually get you spending more than the $599 you may have initially considered spending. It is a way to get your foot on that price ladder."
2025-02-25,"With starting prices of $720 in Europe. For people who are in their middle 30-s and up and have much more better things to do than gaming on a phone or taking pictures of coffee cups, iPhone really has little to offer anymore besides status, a clean UI and the feeling you have to lower your pants and bend over."
2025-03-06,thanks for this. thanks for getting to the point right out of the gate.
2025-02-25,Just the test pilot for the new modem.

2025-03-13,"A few weeks ago I bought a brand new 13. Not refurbished, brand new. And if I watch comparison videos with newer models, I think that that was a good decision. I paid €529 for it, including taxes."
2025-03-06,2:14 ahhhh when phones used to come with headphones. I took the simple things for granted as a youngin
2025-03-06,"I got the latest iphone SE, it's light, easy to use, does the job - call, text, msgs, music, photos. I wont upgrade for the next 10 years because I got an iPad mini anyway - I only do social media when I'm at home."
2025-02-25,4:50 straight up thought that was an iPhone’s settings… looks like Android and iOS are closer than ever haha
7  ago,Loved the intro
2025-02-25,"9:40
So basically this is a low risk test of their new modem?"
2025-03-06,"I love the intro, I’ve been waiting for this phone because I’m on the second generation SE from back in 2020. But, I might wait for that 17 air everybody’s talking about."
2025-02-25,7:17 That look of regret - thinking of the phone hitting the ground after he threw it...
2025-03-06,best intro ever made

2025-03-13,I love the intro
2025-03-06,The intro was funny! I would've asked the question the moment I saw 'whatever that is' on his top lip!
2025-02-25,12:56 vat in europe is crazyyy in italy it costs 729 euros

6  ago,"You gave a very honest review.. I was searching for your video on YouTube, finally subscribed to your channel. I am using 14 Pro at back panel got damaged heavily and acting weird (restarting randomly), fighting with my brain to get 16 or 16e. Because of the damage not getting very good trade-in."
2025-02-25,Grandparent's iphone !!!!!
2025-03-06,This phone is the phone my dad wants and he's getting it..
2025-02-25,"I am upgrading my s23 ultra soon to iphone 16e.. To prepare for it, I have switched to 60Hz and have put insulating tape on the 0.6x, 3x and 10x lenses. So much excite..!"
2025-03-13,Maybe this is a business phone idea that companies can give to their employees without complaining about its slowness.
2025-03-06,"i use an iphone 13 with the same screen, I barely use the ultrawide, I never wirelessly charge and my phone case doesn't have MagSafe. I think for someone looking to try an iphone for the first time after only having had low end to mid range android phones (one of which was a oneplus 7t which was around the same price and only got 3 years of security updates) because they couldn't mentally justify the cost of an iphone, this gets you most of the iPhone experience. This is also a great upgrade for someone still on an iphone 11, XR or 8. When i was buying my iphone 13, there was no oled option for 600 dollars, I had to pay 750."
2025-02-25,More like this please
2025-02-25,Love you acting
2025-03-06,At this point apple should run the idea by you first

2025-02-25,C1 vs Qualcomm speed test would’ve been nice
2025-03-06,This isn’t remotely trying to appeal to someone who would consider a refurbished iPhone 15 or even know that there is a refurbished phone market. This is the newest phone for anyone who doesn’t understand specs and walks into the Apple Store to ask “what’s the cheapest phone you offer”
2025-02-25,5:00 is that OnePlus charger
2025-02-25,9:18 no ultra wide band…???
2025-02-25,1:59 NEINNNNNN 🇩🇪

That ""who are you?' sums it all up"
2025-02-25,Mkbhd x titu mama
2025-02-25,0:01 W Start to the video
2025-02-25,no wide camera
2025-03-13,"Ah the irony, i got an iphone 16 ad right before this video!"
2025-02-25,Can someone tell me what’s that golf game on 4:52 it looks so good
2025-02-25,4:52 what is this game anyone know?
2025-02-25,Yuk. A notch
2025-03-06,I think there’s actually quite a large audience for it. Here in Germany the 16 starts at 950€ and refurbished 15 Pros are around 800€. So I think a lot of people with a smaller budget will prefer to spend the 700€ for the 16e. Especially since SE/ E buyers usually keep their phones for a very long time and often prefer to buy current generation.
2025-02-25,Jolly good show
2025-02-25,8:29
6  ago,Entertaining and informative review!
9  ago,"Apple, the company forever pushing the boundaries to how little they can give you for more money."
2025-03-13,Just upgraded from a 7plus. Definitely an upgrade. And so relieved.
7  ago,Im going from an iPhone 11 Pro to the 16e. I didnt pay for it myself since my workplace is buying it for me but becides losing 3 cameras I think its a decent upgrade. Im gonna miss the wide lense camera though.
6  ago,If you remember when the iPhone XR launched it was $750 with a single camera. I consider this launch a similar situation and if you look at from that prospective $599 is not a bad price.
2  ago,"60 Hz screen in 2025 ohh please, Tim cooked is out of his mind"
2025-03-13,I would agree with the iphone15 suggestion except that the battery life in the 16e is SO much better. That’s one factor that literally ever user will notice on a day to day basis and definitely a huge selling point for me. I just upgraded from an SE and although I do wish it was a little cheaper I don’t exactly have buyers regret either. You do compromise on some of the bells and whistles but all in all it’s a good phone with a more than decent camera and superior battery life.
2025-03-13,I bought one traded my paid off 14 got the 16e for $100 battery life is amazing
2025-03-13,Kids! Kids should have this phone. It’s light. Durable. And the battery lasts a long time. It’s a great tracker.
2025-03-06,Sick intro
2025-03-06,"In Japan, it costs 100,000 yen. Almost it feels like 1,000 USD for us, Japanese people. It is because USDJPY is high though. But iPhone SE3 was 57,000 yen. Huge huge jump."
2025-03-13,Where can you get an iPhone 15 pro at that price? Even on refurb
2025-03-06,I take it that the intro was too late to be nominated in last night's Oscars?
7  ago,“You won’t really notice anything” sums apples latest advancements up! Lol
2025-03-13,"meanwhile, me looking for a iPod replacement

""with no simcard, this will do hehehe"""
2025-03-06,That skit was hilarious.
2025-03-06,I skip the acting part cuz I think it was me check
2025-03-06,MKBHD drove really fast to get that phone in time
2025-03-06,I wonder if this phone is only to show off the C1 modem that probably makes the battery life slightly better.
2025-03-06,"I just traded an old iPhone 7 32GB I had laying around to update my wife's iPhone 12 Mini 32GB. She keeps running out of memory on it and battery is draining fast so decided update her to this iPhone 16e 128GB White. T-Mobile is giving me $250 in credit for the old iPhone 7 32GB. My wife is one of those who doesn't really care and quite truth, she didn't even want to upgrade I kind of made her. We will keep her old iPhone 12 Mini as my toddler's new toy phone. Lol. The iPhone 7 was her old toy phone so she's kinda getting an update too. Win win! The iPhone 16e 128 GB- White will cost me $14/month for the next 24 months so roughly $350 total after my promotion credit ($250) from T-Mobile. I payed $90 as initial payment which included $35 T-Mobile service charge and CA sales tax. So a total of $450 is still in my opinion a budget phone."
8  ago,Marques in a nice and gentlemenly way is saying the phone is trash
2025-03-13,Do a smartphone awards and give rank to flagship as well as budget models as well. Looking forward to one of those.
2025-03-06,One cool thing about this phone is the single camera
2025-03-13,"The intro was perfect!

I also have the feeling this phone will mostly be sold by carriers who offer it with $0 on a contract. So yeah, not a great deal."
2025-03-13,Exactly! The iPhone 16e is like the small fries on the menu—it only exists to make you order the large one.
2025-03-06,"It's also huge. If it was a 4.5"" or 5"" it would be appealing as a ""pocketable"" iPhone, as an alternative to the phablet trend."
2025-03-06,HAhaha this felt like me prompting the AI to tell me exactly what I want to read
2025-03-06,"“Apple says the iPhone 16e is a ‘new family member,’ not part of the SE line. And let’s be real—no one introduces a new family member just to take out the old one. This isn’t a mafia movie… or is it?”"
2025-03-13,"-What features do you want in your phone?
-Nothing...
-Here you go - $700"
2025-03-06,MKB can be a good comedian.
2025-03-06,Honest Reviewer
2025-03-06,this phone would honestly receive less hate if it was $499 or in a range of $450-$500 range
2025-03-06,"They nerfed the 16 to a pretty significant level, but then priced this so high it makes no sense. I don’t know what they were thinking. I was waiting for this to come out to get my kid a budget apple, then I saw the price compared to the old se and was shocked. To be honest, this is the first time in years I’ve strongly considered jumping over to android. Apple just has such a seamless ecosystem, but as others catch up, I’ll be jumping over soon."
2025-03-13,"When dude said I could compare the performance of iPhones, I got the oldest iPhone 6s plus ever LOL"
10  ago,The 'v' in iPhone 16e stands for value.
2025-03-13,Recently traded in my Fold 4 to the s25 ultra + Buds 3 pro + watch 7 + case + screen protector and I was only out of pocket $900 AUD ( $567usd) when using a bunch of coupons. I will continue to upgrade every 2 years to the latest android flagship and I can almost always get the latest and greatest + all accessories for under 1k.
2025-03-06,"So, I understand what everyone’s saying about the pricing for me. I bought this phone because I didn’t have to pay full price. I traded in my old phone that was having horrible sound quality and I only paid $90 for the phone and I got $800 credit back. So, what I will say is that for someone who didn’t have to pay full price I’ll take this phone but I do think overall that if I did have to pay for the phone, I would have gone for the 15 instead. Plus, I don’t take a lot of pictures and if I do, I have my iPad and I also have my family’s other phones so I’m not really so worried about the camera or the lighting. Benefits of being blind."
2025-03-06,The intro
2025-03-06,"And also let’s not forget that a 15pro refurb/slightly used iPhone will continue to go down in price in another 6 months, sounds like a no brainer. I’m sure it won’t be hard to find somewhere to buy a refurb/used that accepts Affirm if you need to finance"
2025-03-06,"The iPhone 16e is more like a modern iPhone XR than an SE replacement. It’s an affordable but still modern iPhone, rather than a “budget” model that reuses old designs. It fits in Apple’s lineup much like the XR did in 2018—a lower-cost version of the flagship, but not a budget phone."
2025-03-06,"Love the intro.. ""who are you""!?"
2025-03-06,"i feel like if i’m buying this phone i’m just rebuying the iPhone X but at a cheaper price and to this day i’m still using the X as it’s never failed me but i am a little interested in this phone just bc of having to stay up to date, camera quality doesn’t really matter to me and especially with that magnet bobber that i’ve never used in my life"
2025-03-06,"So, visually, this is CLOSE to what I want. I’ve always been a fan of the mostly recessed single camera set up in white. Basically iPhone 4S. If it’s not broke, don’t fix it. 

We had to go through years of sub par designs to come full circle back to Steve Jobs’ design influence. 

If this phone had MagSafe, Dynamic Island, proper wireless charging, and 120Hz display, I’d be sold. Literally. Because I like the exterior design. But there’s really no reason for this phones price point to be 30% higher than before."
2025-03-06,This was a funny and informative video subbed
2025-03-06,Thank you.  I’ll wait for the 17.  I felt it was a rush to market with only two colors.
2025-03-06,Thank you I needed this video
2025-03-06,God i loved that intro
32  ago,I think the new era of iphone is budget phones
2025-03-06,"My boss has the 3rd gen SE and he absolutely loves the thing. He thinks its the best thing out there and thats okay for him atleast, even though he thinks 400 bucks was too much... What a simple man."
2025-03-06,"still on a 14 pro max and battery life is 2 days. key is to use the included cable and one of the apple bricks. leave optimized charging on, never turn that off."
2025-03-06,thanks for the wonderful review
2025-03-06,I play golf rivals too. Lmao
2025-03-13,Hey I totally agree with Marcus in this video off his the price off the new iPhone 16e is too expensive when Apple was making this new phone and it doesn't have magsafe they should have came up with a price as low as possible at $599 is way too much for it if apple came up with this price at $499 I would say alot off people would totally buy it then.
2025-03-13,The fact that they usesd the same back as the 14 which literally hadagsafe but didnt including on this phone is ridiculous
13  ago,This feels like Apple made a fleet phone for companies to give their employees
2025-03-13,"It’s a great, second, work phone - with a a really good battery life. Been using it for a week, very happy."
12  ago,Apple release this phone to just test out his cellular modem to not mess up the 16 lineup
2025-03-06,"This phone is eerily made for me, who wanted an iphone for under $1k, wanted Apple intelligence, and didn’t care about MagSafe or refresh rate. Too bad for me I bought a iphone 16 and have an extra magnet and dynamic island"
2025-03-06,"This phone has killed displays without PWM. Shame on you, Apple. You are completely ignoring this issue. And you never listen and do what ever is good for your profits. How about making products for people?"
2025-03-06,"3:00
""basically taking parts that theyve already spent the money engineering and using them"" - talking about the SE but this applies to basically every iphone after the iphone 12"

13  ago,"Ugh, the editor in me can't look away at the color grading of the iMac in the back that shows up in your hand whenever you raise it over the iMac. It makes your hand super yellow too. Gotta take some time to roto that out...  Great video either way, definitely skipping this one."
11  ago,I work in IT for a big commany the iPhone has been the go to work phone for us and the iPhone SE in particular we have around 400 in use. The problem we face is we have to get new phones in and also save cost. The fact that this phone is in Sweden is $679 and the iPhone 15 is $789 without vat is crazy we might have to switch after 15 years of using Appel phones.
2025-03-06,But is it fast enough to break the law near schools?
2025-03-06,The reason I’m getting it is because I just broke my iPhone 14 Pro Max. Figure this will hold me over and I can trade it on when quorum or air comes in fall.
2025-03-06,Why are people still buying the newest iPhone?
2025-03-13,"The next ""e"" model will look even sleeker with no camera"
3  ago,The only reason that Apple released the 16e was so they can bump up the prices for the 17 line up this fall. This is why they created the SE it was a prop for so many years so they could then non budget the SE as in the 16e and bump the prices up on the new line up. This is their marketing scheme and so for the next couple budget IPhones in the 3 to 5 years to come they will do this all over again. It’s the only way they can make the people pay more for the main line up and make the price hike seem normal. Apple is greedy and evil but we keep buying cause they make the best of the best if we like it or not
13  ago,The ''Spanish audio track'' Its 100% the wrong one...
2025-03-06,MOUSTACHE KBHD BABYYYYYY
2025-03-06,Great intro  love the review - good job!!!
2025-03-06,"Marques, would love to see the outtakes from the decision on how you say, ""Who are you?"""
2025-03-06,"I feel like I'm a perfect target for this phone. It sounds like the beginning of a line-up that's great to me.

First of all, I'm not in the USA. There's no official Apple refurbished market here. There are refurbished iphones handled by third-parties, but the quality isn't usually the same as if it was refurbished by Apple themselves. 

I own an iphone 12, bought at launch, whose battery I replaced about five/six months ago, and I'm not looking to replace the phone in 2025, but I'm planning to do it within the next two years.
I don't care for the camera (I find its post-processing awful), I don't care for magsafe (I use a non-magsafe wireless charger - four years, it's never been an issue!), but I care with having oled (the main reason I picked the 12 instead of the 11), Face ID and the operating system itself.
While I don't find the 16E specifically tempting to me, because I'm not looking to replace my phone now, I'll probably love, for instance, a 17E or 18E, when the time comes.

So, spending €739 on this or €989 on the 16?
I'd definitely appreciate not spending over €900 on an iphone again."
2025-03-06,"the only thing I used to give gave Apple credit for was that at least iphones don't get laggy - but then I tried countless iphones including brand new display iphone 16/pros, they are not as polished as I thought they would be."
2025-03-06,As a current user of the SE2020 I appreciate you straight to the chase review and comparisons. I’m not into the latest anything and always love a small pocket phone so the SE was always ok for me. The price on that 16e made me want to know what’s the catch?! And you answered my questions. Lolol Appreciate you!
2025-03-06,The video started at 0:00 and got finished at 1:34
2025-03-06,"Iphone doesn't want to sale this model, they just trying to increase the number of models in  shelves"
10  ago,I’m waiting for China to tell Apple they’re not making iPhones anymore. Thanks trump
2025-03-06,iSheep will literally buy anything
10  ago,If Apple intended the 16e to replace the SE then they should have priced it at $499. A lot of people just want a communication device and could care less about the advanced features.
2025-03-06,"Coming from an iPhone 14 Pro, to not have to upgrade within 4 years I’m considering my next upgrade to be an se version"
2025-03-06,Love the sketch take!
2025-03-06,I’ve had an iPhone for decades and I don’t know what MagSafe is. I think most of the people I know with iPhones also don’t know what it is.
2025-03-06,The lack of magsafe is wild. They're leaving accessories revenue on the table.
2025-03-06,"you should have mentioned ""I still love the old notch in 2025 and not the dynamic island"" lol."
2025-03-13,Here's something ironic: The price of xiaomi 15 ultra in China is the same as iPhone 16e in US
2025-03-06,"Turns out my company likes the phone as it is the cheapest iPhone you can get currently directly from Apple. I just ordered the iPhone 15 over the company (we are always one generation behind) and it got rejected because of the 16e being available. So there is its niche: It's the cheapest and if you want (or rely on) iOS, you go with this thing. Crazy that - at least in my country - this phone is still more expensive than my new base Mac Mini M4."
2025-03-06,"I think as a someone who cares about the tech we forget about the average person. This phone will do well because it has some new features, looks newish, and is cheaper. This is the new XR. Plus with the cost of living going up, its harder for the average person to upgrade to the latest and greatest pro model. The biggest issue for the average person will be the colors..."
6  ago,You can’t call it a budget iPhone when it’s still just $600
2025-03-06,I think this will do good as a work phone
9  ago,that's excatley me !!! hahaha
2025-03-06,the e stands for escape throw it out lmao
2025-03-06,"Lord Farquaad Markiplier be like:
IPhone 16🇪️️️"
11  ago,"I believe this phone will actually be a way better value next year. 

Either because it's price will go down or everything else will get more expensive.... Especially in the US."
2025-03-06,"They should’ve simply named it iPhone XI R, that would’ve laid all these debates to rest"
7  ago,So pretty much this an Iphone 16 for elderly people . And it does make since they did remove the stuff . Since well old people are confusing people.
2025-03-06,What really surprised me the most was when marques was playing golf on the iPhone and I was like bro I don’t know too much about golf but that was a pretty solid move
5  ago,The best type-c test mobile device in 2028
2  ago,The camera sensor was smaller but they made the aperture wider f/1.6 to let in more light
2025-03-06,I'm surprised no reviews compared this to the iPhone XR... This is basically an iPhone 16R
2025-03-06,"Knowing that Marques only reviews products that are coming to US, it's clear that the products that he reviews are getting more and more outdated compare to whatever launched in china. including cars. such a shame. GL to you guys stuck there."
2025-03-06,"Guys the Iphone 16e is like the se made for companies. They are devices that are just beeing used for work. A work phone, not a private phone."
10  ago,"I got mine for under $250, it might be refurbished but they didn’t tell me when I bought but I know part of the discount was from changing my wireless plan for one 10$ more a month"
6  ago,Laughing while watching this on my iPhone 11 Pro Max. I pray that this phone lasts until my last breath
2025-03-06,"Everyone talks about megapixels, operating systems, and camera specs when a new smartphone drops, but in reality, most of us just share pictures and videos through messaging and social media. If you send a photo from an iPhone to another iPhone, it looks great. The same goes for Samsung-to-Samsung via RCS. But what really matters is how well photos and videos hold up when sent across different messaging platforms like iMessage, RCS, or even through social media apps. So, I have a question: Which phone actually delivers the best image and video quality when shared over messaging and social media? Since that’s how we all view and exchange content, I’d love to see a video comparison on this!"
13  ago,"Should be a OK phone for me . I'm replacing a apple iphone 6s I got in 2015. I don't use the phone much I use to listen to ipods, music. And same price as 10 years ago."
2025-03-06,"So I might be getting one of these for a family member, only because it's cheaper than older phone options.  Let's just assume this phone exists to make 0% $6 a month phones available for data harvesting on all those free to use apps that people love.  It's a phone that will only sell as a subsidy or a mistaken gift at Christmas from your great aunt who's deaf and blind but loves you so dearly because you remind her of her dead cat."
2025-03-13,"Also, with 17 launch just 6 months away, 
Expect a price drop!
Apple wants to mint good profits outta this, and they’re gonna do that from people who buy in the next 5-6 months!
So if you wanna buy this, october’s probably the right month!!"
2025-03-06,Was going to upgrade from a SE 2nd Gen to the 16E.  Then after reviewing the 16E saw it was a bad deal. Ended up getting a New Opened 15 for $500 off eBay phone is great & a good size for me vs pro version.  Recommend to anyone with SE looking to upgrade
12  ago,6:15  no magnets 8:56 wifi 10:29 no 5g 12:34 iPhone 15 pro
2025-03-06,"Apple literally had one chance to make an actually good cheap iPhone, and somehow they butchered it in the most Apple way possible: being too overpriced"
2025-03-06,$299 is the perfect price for Iphone 16e.
2025-03-13,3:22 feel good inc W
2025-03-06,"i think theyre preparing this phone to be a staple for ""cheaper"" phones in the far future. Meaning we could see even more expensive iphones. Seems like a long term play to me"
2025-03-13,This would be a very competitive phone at a price of 200$. Max should've been 300$. WTF is 600$!
2025-03-06,"Awsome I just broke my beloved I phone 12 Mini yesterday . I am Mr. lowtech. And bought the Iphone 16e. So he knows pretty much what he is talking about. The size of the 12 mini was perfect.
I just have to suffer a little bit with the slightly bigger size of the 16e. Bigger than this is out of the question."
2025-03-06,"With RCS on iPhones, I think more people may be open to switching to Android now."
13  ago,Personally i like that design tbh
2025-03-13,Corporate companies will welcome this phone to provide to their employees. All theirs employees really need is a phone for calls and emails. It's a great cost reduction and something that will be bought in bulk benefiting Apple sales.
2025-03-06,My hand is small. Apple really needs to make smaller phones again. Big phones don’t fit in pockets and they’re heavy.
2025-03-06,"So I think this phone is perfect for me. Ive had an iPhone 12mini for 4 years. Ive been offered 1500 NOK to buy it back and also 1000 NOK discount on the new phone. in Norway the phone is overpriced. It's 8990 NOKso I get it now for around 6400 NOK. So ive never changed a camera setting, I just take a picture and walk off. Same as taking videos, I just record and walk off. The 12 mini has MagSafe and I also have a MagSafe case from apple but ive used it maybe 4 times in 4 years. I always just plug in the cable as my AirPods are same lightning connector. I use it daily for emails and for messaging and calling. Also maybe now and then on the Internet but limited. I don't need the latest biggest iPhone on the market I just want something up to date that can take photos and videos and that I can reply to emails on. Simple. Im in the apple eco system, I have a basic iPad and a MacBook Air M2. So for me with the discounts it's a significant upgrade without it being so expensive and full of technology I don't use and  don't need. I guess im getting older and don't need all this tech stuff. But for me the 16E is a perfect upgrade with the discounts."
2025-03-06,"It's for enterprise, all our SE will be replaced with these eventually once the providers start offering them at discount like they always do the lowest models."
9  ago,"When considering buying a refurbished phone, what is the difference between ""Fair"", ""Good"", and ""Excellent"" condition? What tangible difference am I paying for? How does Best Buy decide what condition a phone is in?"
2025-03-13,"They'll probably drop the price to $499 in September when the iPhone 17 comes out, since it's a part of the iPhone 16 line."
2025-03-13,"Why is it sold for $900 in my home country, Armenia, when the price is only $599?"
6  ago,I bought a 3rd gen brand new less than a year ago and I’ve had more issues with it than I’ve had with any other iPhone. They were done with the se before 2022.
2025-03-13,Very well explained funny yet truth explained
2025-03-06,This is the first time i've watched your videos and your review is beyond my expectations. This is exactly what i'm thinking. It's actually good phone for many people (like me which i was waiting for the SE4 for couple years) but the price is too much. In my country it's selling 1300USD with goverment's cruel additional taxes and this really makes the 16e unaffordable. I hope apple reconsider the price on this budget(?) phone so we can get one.
2025-03-06,I mean based on the price of the 1st SE starting price of 399 adjusted for inflation would be 540 in today’s money. So the fact that they kept the prices of the SE at that for this long is a miracle. Also the prices of an iPhone 6s when the SE first dropped was 650 and I remember people saying that the price didn’t match the product and you could just grab and iPhone 5s refurbished for 200-250.
2025-03-06,0:00. Aleady a banger
2025-03-06,As Carl Pei cleverly puts it Loss King Strategy . Not made to be sold but to make other products more reasonable. This will massively boost sales of old notch iPhones to clear the remaining stock while also ensuring iPhone 17 bump up prices in future is justified.
8  ago,"I really like the one camera look and long battery life with new iPhone look, I also never used MagSafe in the first place so I like it"
2025-03-06,"This is pretty much identical to the iPhone 5c problem in 2013; except this time, it lacks so many features that any new iPhones have built-in."
4  ago,"WTF is the iPhone 16e?
Apple basically took a leftover iPhone 14 shell, slapped in a nerfed A18 chip (one GPU core short—like getting a pizza minus one slice), stuck a basic OLED screen on it (no fancy refresh rates here), and called it ""budget"" at $599. At this price, it's kinda stretching the definition of ""budget."""
6  ago,bro did not just casually throw the phone in the case behind him on the floor during the ad.
2025-03-06,give that dude an OSCAR!
2025-03-13,He brings ''Dope'' to the tech guys and asks who am I?
2025-03-06,"Dude you’re a Genius, Oscar nomination , bravo!"
12  ago,Who came back to see mkbhd asking WHO ARE YOU?
2025-03-06,"The person I would buy this phone for is my Grandmother or one of my kids. Someone who I know would enjoy the iPhone, but could care less for having the latest iPhone like that because they were introduced to Apple first via as a gift and with the iPad. Not the iPhone first. At some point I knew the price would increase. So, for me it’s like. If I’m paying $600+. I might as well consider an older iPhone, etc. But the price for items is going up regardless. We all knew it was coming. I break down inflation like this. Every time minimum wage gets a price increase. Society finds a way to slowly increase everything over a 2 to 3 year time period. Overprice something like eggs. Then bring the price down to make it so call “feel” reasonable again. These are the little games that are played. Therefore, over a short period of time. The minimum wage increase means nothing because of everything goes up. It’s just balanced out again and technically you’re just paying the price of what it would’ve been when you were making whatever less 4 to 5 years ago. Inflation. Cost of living just goes up over a short period of time. So, the price really isn’t bad. It just matches the times and it eventually was going to go up anyway. I personally would never buy this phone because as an owner of the 16 Pro Max by way of the 14 Pro Max. I am too dependent on MagSafe & the Dynamic Island. I wish iPhones had two WiFi chips. But I’ve always felt Apple, how do I say this correctly, creates opportunity for other ideas to be born and buys out those ideas that are really good. If something exist that’s awesome. Instead of them always creating their own. They may “acquire” what already exist. I’m not against the one camera for my kids or grandmother. This phone is not for me. I’m accustom to updating my iPhone every 2 to 3 years. Not my iPad. But for my grandmother and kids. I’m more accustomed to updating their iPad more than their iPhone because their personality is “I like iPad more”. The phone is just an extension for when they don’t have an iPad with them. I’m the other way around."
2025-03-06,"13 mini user here. Still prefer 13 mini, I hope they will release mini on succeeding iphones"
2025-03-06,"It's a phone for Chinese market, as the starting price of this phone just below the upper limit for government subsidy. After subsidy, you can get one of this for around 540 dollars."
2025-03-06,Imagine how much it cost to produce it
2025-03-06,I think a lot of it is that this cellular chip will be put in upcoming Macbooks. That would be really cool option.
10  ago,"I think a return of the 13 mini design for the SE4. £449, 2 cameras, A18 chip. Sold!"
2025-03-06,I recently learned that all these chip companies having one less cpu core or one less gpu core are because these chips have some malfunction during fabrication.  now they can still sell to clear the lower quality chips.
2025-03-06,"all I would like to know is, Is the iPhone 16e the newly improved and updated iPhone 14 Mini? If so, I'd purchase it."
2025-03-06,"I feel like this is a phone purely designed for when businesses need to provide their employees with a phone. Most companies provide iPhones because that’s what the staff prefer, and by upping the price the company will still pay but apple will make a whole lot more money"
2025-03-06,Even the iPhone SE 3 unlocked with 256 gigs of storage is cheaper than the 16e.
2025-03-13,I'm done buying iPhones.  It was bad enough when they took away the analog port but lack of touchID (and forcing faceid) is a deal breaker.
2025-03-13,I see this phone doing best in industries like healthcare and and law enforcement which often stick with a cheaper iPhone for their managed software devices. It kinda feels like a phone that doesn't cater to domestic users at all. But in the enterprise context its much better than as SE.
2025-03-13,Good introduction. Cheers.
2  ago,"good phone, camera is good enough, don't use mag safe, don't care about 120hz on a phone. Small camera bump is a dealbreaker for me, can't stand the one on the new iphones."
2025-03-13,I know one person that I could recommend this to because they are allergic to magnets (I know it’s weird) but they like the home button. So in my opinion this phone isn’t going to sell well.
2025-03-06,This was funny and informative.
2025-03-06,"Apple hater is here. But I have to advocate this phone.

1) I always use a case. And I am sure, people, who buy SE/E, intend to use their phones for years and also use cases to prolong devices' service span. I do not need the alignment magnets to be built in the phone. Moreover, I don't want them on my phone: I want to get a bigger battery and less weight instead. And moreover, I probably don't need inductive charging at all: I have it on my phone, I have a charger, and never use it.

2) I have a wide-lens camera, and I used it two times to shoot room interior. But I always miss the telephoto lens. Do you really need the wide-lens?

3) I never bought used phones. I don't want to use a refurbished/used phone: seals are compromised, PCBs already have micro cracks, some elements are corroded. And software/firmware may be maliciously modified. Comparison of a new phone with a used is not legit.

The only reason to have an iPhone in a drawer is Airtags tracking and spotting. Android analogues don't have enough participants in peer grids to provide the same coverage and precision. And the iPhone 16E doesn't have the spotting hardware.

Anyway, go waste 600$ + taxes on the downgraded Apple-services pocket terminal."
2025-03-06,"I ordered a 16e as a replacement for my Pixel 3a which has been failing to function reliably as... a phone or communication device. It needs a new battery, buttons, the chassis is cracked, and it also has some corrosion misc water damage, so refurb is just not something I have the time or resources to do(The screen is original and miraculously in mint condition).
I was hoping for a refreshed 4th gen SE, but 16e checked enough boxes. I didn't want multiple cameras on the back, I own a camera. I don't like wireless charging because it's wasteful. And I didn't go secondhand, because I want at least 5 years of security updates.
The only downside I'm running into is how smug friends and family will be when I'm no longer the only green bubble in their contacts. Also I'm regretting not switching from Android's 3 button navigation sooner, because as much as I loved it, the move to iphone gesture navigation is extremely unintuitive.
(I didn't go pixel again because I hate the camera bumps and don't have a reason to stay in the the google ecosystem and have moved away from google services since Play Music was shut down.)"

That's what it's for, people who don't get to complain about missing magsafe, UWB and mutliple cameras. They need an iphone for remote management but otherwise they bought the SE and they'll buy this."
2025-03-13,"I think Apple priced this phone like that. They showed the unprofitable 16e. By doing so, they show that it is even more profitable to spend more on 15 and 16"

My only choice is the 14, and now Apple has officially discontinued the 14.  Hoping there will be a red iPhone 17!"
8  ago,"As a standalone product, this phone has no business being $599. Its not an affordable/budget iPhone. Its a dumbed down step up iPhone. Some people argued with me that well this phone is clearly not made for me. But like I'm sorry as consumers, we deserve to consider the value of the phone against our money spent. Its called being smart and not letting these companies get away with it especially for those who do not know better (financial illiterate folks or elders etc). This phone should be competing but ended up not with phones like the Pixel a-series and Samsung FE phones. Just compare what those phones are to something like the 16E and what they are in relation to their flagship brethrens. The Pixel a-series aren't dumbed down Pixels, its by itself a fairly capable phone with a strong identity. The 16E feels way too dumbed down like its just clearly an iPhone made from spare and leftover parts from manufacturing. Even the SE had a more solid place and identity within the iPhone lineup previously. This isn't a SE4 nor an iPhone 16 Lite. Its just an excuse for Apple to sell people up the expensive iPhone ladder."

2025-03-06,0:50 Nobody ever asked for that
2025-03-06,This phone is not a consumer product. The main target group is and has always been corporate.
2025-03-06,You can get a fold 6 512gb for basically 900 or less with trade-in. Yikes apple.
2025-03-06,You are all naive. Apple is just preparing to spike the prices in September. All the pieces will fall in place when new iphone starts at 899.
2025-03-06,"This phone actually targets someone like me who did not plan to upgrade their iPhone 12, hadn't yet replaced the phone battery after 4 years of owning it, and was struggling to keep the phone up-to-date  because the 64GB storage was almost full.

2025-03-06,It kinda reminds me of S10e. You all remember that right?
3  ago,they killed my boy SE 4 to this
2025-03-06,hey thanks I was considering that phone but I have clarity now
11  ago,Do I want the iphone 15 pro max or would an older pro max be similiar? I want the best camera and largest screen. Cant pay $1000+.  Thank you. God bless you.
6  ago,"Personally, I never have a phone without a case. So if it doesn't come with magsafe, a case with magsafe is better."
2025-03-13,I noticed the iPhone 13 mini is not in the comparison at the end of the video. That phone has Ultra Wideband and MagSafe. I was considering upgrading my iPhone 13 mini to this phone but definitely not after watching this video!
2025-03-13,The minor zoom on specifying at 13:44 is a good choice  and it's a selling point for 15 pro not 16e
2025-03-06,I would buy it if they had a size 13 mini model. I dont like big phones anymore
2025-03-06,The guy who made 50$ subscription app for wallpapers complaining that this phone isn’t priced right
2025-03-13,CHEAP? it's 600$ what the f
2025-03-06,That was a very Throttle House openings!
13  ago,Thats the phone employers buy for their employees in the absence of SE
2025-03-26,"I had to return mine. Exchanged it once because it was overheating, replacement was the exact same. Was literally just texting and it got super hot over nothing. Ridiculous."
2025-03-06,Insightful!!
2025-03-06,Can't wait to see the new iphone 17 series price. 899? 999? lol
2025-03-06,If they just made this a mini it would make sense again
2025-03-06,"I’m getting it. It’s gonna be an upgrade from my iPhone 13 mini, I don’t even need all the fancy functions like precision whatever, I even have I cloud so I literally just need a base model to stay in the eco system. I probably am their target customer here"
2025-03-06,"Apple is clearly going round in circles now, whereas android flagships are moving forward"
9  ago,iPhone make this phone under $299 so every one can buy and people get iphone in budget
2025-03-13,He is playing Michael Key
2025-03-13,I’m just upset they didn’t made an iPhone 16e mini next to it. Still rocking my 13 mini!
2025-03-13,It looks like they're trying to remake the iPhone SE after all these years.  The camera and flash are located the same.
2025-03-06,"I don't get MagSafe... so you can't really use a phone while it's on a wireless charging pad, so they came up with MagSafe, which essentially tethers the phone to...a cable.  You could also just use a cable. Am I missing something?"
2025-03-06,"Apple's thinking - you will pay as much as we can make you pay, in light of needing an iphone as you are locked in, yet feeling left behind without a button that is not a button, but is a button; and needing a feature that isn't a feature, but is all new, but isn't new, but is. Would sir like the cable with the phone?"
2025-03-06,"I have to agree with the conclusion: The phone is good but the price isn't right. When I saw the announcement, I was hoping it would be $ 100 less. Well, it's not. And it wasn't even clear from the presentation that the camera has a smaller sensor and that it doesn't have MagSafe. That is a bummer. We can only hope its value increases once Apple Intelligence really is a thing but other than that... Well, the basic iPhone 16 is still a better deal."
2025-03-06,"when is the 16 e coming review
  coming out arun?"
2025-03-06,Love the Mustache!
2025-03-26,I will be upgrading from an iphone 8…..is 16e worth it or should I just go for 15
2025-03-06,"Tbh, I want to see how many of those refurbished 15pro for about 600$ are actually around and don't look like from a warzone"
7  ago,"iPhone is premium phone and not cheap at all 

1- 16e for regular users 
(Social Media, average games, calls, internet searches, e shopping) 


2- 16 for younger generation mostly who still cares about latest tech 
( video games, long hours watching, spending time for better camera shots) + all extra commonly usable tech features 

3- 16 pro is for premium and advanced experience 
For tow users 
1/ you want to brag about it 
2/ you gonna defiantly use it to it’s limits because you need it or need more from it"
7  ago,been rocking my iphone 13 mini and was hoping this was an upgrade but it really isnt
2025-03-06,Best skit
2025-03-06,Does the 16e have a more resilient screen—less likely to crack?
2025-03-06,If it was $429 still it would have a good place in the lineup. Again for kids/older people/people who don’t really care about phones
2025-03-13,"This is for corporate accounts, I could see companies like GEM Industrial buying these pieces of shit by the thousands"
11  ago,"I know that this may not be the place for this comment, but in addition to all Apple's mistakes, one simply cannot be forgiven, and that is that when you move a picture from recent to alum with the ""move"" option, it is not actually moved there, but copied. If I wanted it in recents, I wouldn't open a separate album. The most annoying thing"
2025-03-06,"Something that annoys me about the iPhone 16e isn’t that “cheap” even for me as an Australian as for me it’s costs about $1,000 dollars which is crazy because at that price I could buy an iPhone 16 Pro Max with an extra 700 dollars, Which is crazy!"
13  ago,Was that a severance reference??
2025-03-13,I was planning to buy a 16e until they released it and had the price at $599. Now I’m just getting a used 15 Pro instead.
2025-03-13,"In all honesty, we live in a world where people are not blinking eating a $5 donut (instead of the $0.79 average just a few years back), so yeah, what's $599+? Meh."
2025-03-06,"I have been using SEs and I am a touch-ID lover, so I'm out."
2025-03-06,Came here from Michael Fisher
2025-03-06,"Callin' the iPhone 15 cheap, must be a misunderstanding."
2025-03-06,Bring back the mini
2025-03-13,Hope at least 1 reviewer would confirm. The C1 modem or the new 16e has bluetooth issues. Audio over bluetooth Stutters when connected to anything. Sad no reviewer would mention that. I am on my 2nd 16e now but no solution. Spend over 3hours sharing logs with apple. It’s a known issue with apple aware and all over the internet.
2025-03-06,The 16e launched in Brazil 200 USD more expensive than regular 16
2025-03-06,"I swear companies are somehow liking and feeding off of these negative reviews. Nvidia, Apple, Sammie etc whatever they bring out sucks and they get bashed for it and yet people flock to them in droves. WTF? Is there sth I don't know? Reverse psychology? Are they shorting their own company? Cashing out?"
11  ago,"2:33 just checked online, but i can trade my SE for the 16e and it'll bring the cost down to $499."
2025-03-06,Apple robbing Apple fanboys in broad daylight.
2025-03-06,"Why not use mini iPhone 13 as the budget phone (16 e mini) but with one  the 16e as the Plus model with dual rear lense, and to bring price down, get rid of face ID, and instead have finger print scanner on the side of the phone, and please have massager and faster wireless and charging speed.
Plus please offer more colours too."
2025-03-06,Apple: We only create good product.. videos.
2025-03-06,"Some people simply aim to buy the newest cheapest iPhone, because that’s what they can afford."
2025-03-06,"Finally one camera, but why that camera bump is still there?"
8  ago,"Is it worth to trade with 13 pro max as i only use for general purpose only ? Like calls, WhatsApp and social apps"
2025-03-06,"Iphone 16e is an Apple ecosystem primary basic entry who wants to try apple ecosystem with less money relatively .
What do you think ?"
5  ago,You can't suggest it to people but you can give it for free to people using 150£ phones.
2025-03-06,I still love that phone personally
2025-03-06,LMAO...my 13 mini just became a premium device again.
2025-03-06,"If Marques had to create a skit for the intro, the product must be really crazy silly :')
I think their strategy is launch it at 599, since they had to produce it.. when they reach mass production from the next year start it from 499, bumps the SE price a bit and they increase the revenue and they market the **ck out of it to sell it more..."
