2024-01-14,You are missing all headsets on the market within the price range of the AVR
2024-01-14,"I mean yeah, if you compare a bunch of +4 year old headsets and a Standalone of this year, of course that the resolution will be better...

It's not like there are headsets like the varjo aero, pimax crystal, sonmium vr1 etc..."
2024-01-14,Where’s the Varjo xr4
2024-01-14,"What is the point of doing this if you are not actually going to compare it with high resolution headsets  such as the G2, Pimax Crystal, Somnium VR1, Varjo etc."
2024-01-14,[deleted]
2024-01-14,"What a stupid comparison, misses any modern PCVR headset…"
2024-01-14,"umm If money isnt an object, then im afraid Varjo XR-4 still has the highest resolution in the market. 3840x 3744."
2024-01-14,"This chart is so sheep-ish like it was made by apple...

Vario has 3840x3744 per eye with comparable price."
2024-01-14,Wheres the reverb g2 on this?
2024-01-14,No pimax???
2024-01-14,"Apple vision pro cost compared to other headsets..

Quest 3:$$$$$$$$$$

Apple Vision Pro:$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"
2024-01-14,And only costs *check notes* 7 times as much!
2024-01-14,Are you sure you’re allowed to say resolution?!
2024-01-14,Does it PCVR?
2024-01-14,Now do the same but add the Varjo XR-4 to the comparison.
2024-01-14,Holy fuck what a dumb comparison.
2024-01-14,"Ill just buy 3 quest 3, much cheaper, more resolution."
2024-01-14,And how many games will run on it.... Oh
2024-01-14,"Knowing Apple its probably going to be  something like 1800x1800 and they are going to say something like ""we use our new sub pixel retina focus rendering technology so the 1800x1800 pixels act like 3600x3600"""
2024-01-14,"Quest 3 resolution is more than enough for me, but I’d like a better GPU, detachable battery/slimmer headset, ideally glasses size, much wider FOV, full eye/face tracking much more."
2024-01-14,"We should stop comparing based on panel resolution, because FoV is also a factor in the resulting sharpness. PPD (pixels per degree) is far better."
2024-01-14,7x  the cost for 1.5x resolution. apple at its finest.
2024-01-14,"Nice.

Doesn't change the fact how overpriced it is."
2024-01-14,So weird that so many VR enthusiasts are pissed at Apple for making a no compromises headset and giving people at least an opportunity to try out truly great AR.
2024-01-14,"The AVP pro experience will come from all the hardware, and more importantly *the software* holistically. I think people are really sleeping on how good visionOS will be COMPARED to everything else currently out there. I think visionOS will make MetaOS feel like windows 3.1. Who knows until the reviews come out though."
2024-01-14,Where is PSVR2?
2024-01-14,"The vision pro isn't even a VR headset, it's spatial computing! /s"
2024-01-14,This is just falling for apple marketing.
2024-01-14,How about the Quest Pro or VIVE XR Elite?
2024-01-15,Pico 4 have 4k resolution :/
2024-01-15,For $3500 it better have better resolution than the $500 quest 3
2024-01-14,aahh... this reminds me of the megapixels wars on digital cameras. Read: not a good approach to focus on a single (marketing) parameter... specially in VR where there are so many comfort attributes to consider.
2024-01-14,"Meanwhile, what comes to software…

Fruit Ninja!"
2024-01-14,"I'm not apple fan, not gonna buy one for sure, but I'm still interested in Vision Pro coming out so soon, more devs in XR space is good for others too"
2024-01-14,45 fps
2024-01-14,"Why the fuck would I get an apple vision pro? I already have a pimax crystal which has massive boosted my VR performance through dynamic foveated rendering while still allowing me 8K with 35ppd around where I am looking and all this for 1400 euros, no reason to purchase a relatively small upgrade to a device who I believe isn't made for actual games for the outrages price of 3500 USD, the price isn't justifiable for what it brings to the table and it will most likely only be bought by businesses and very die hard apple fanboys"
2024-01-14,"Yeah but it doesn't do vr, so what's the point it's quite literally an AR /XR head set that cost 3500 and has limited usage, its just for productivity and watching movies. If you move from your spot in and vr type. And I mean type application it just fades back to pass through. It's quite useless. Fov is 100 to 110, no controllers, only works of the apple store so cool you can play angry birds... the flat version it's rubbish. I won't be getting it that's for sure. It may be a pc strapped to your head  but again it amulets and full potential completely destroyed and taken away"
2024-01-14,I'll wait for it to bomb like it surely will and buy it used for a dime
2024-01-14,"Vision Pro has no PCVR support nor existing catalog of games. Why even compare it with headsets that are clearly meant for different purposes.

In addition to that, why leave out similarly priced high-end headsets like Varjo XR-4 that has higher resolution than Vision Pro does?

Are you a Apple fanboy?"
2024-01-14,yea but then i'd have to let an apple product into my house.  just not worth it
2024-04-30,"No one in my entire gaming circle ever seriously talked about the apple vision pro, let alone bought one.  Except at the beginning when we all laughed at apple for making a 3500 dollar headset.  

Then it flopped, surprise, surprise."
2024-01-14,"Dude is literally out there lying about how he's put Oculus DK1 and not Pimax Crystal out there not because he's an apple fanboy but because apparently people know DK1 and don't know pimax. Here you go:

[https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=oculus%20rift%20DK1,varjo%20aero,Pimax%20crystal,hp%20reverb%20g2,big%20screen%20beyond&hl=en](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=oculus%20rift%20DK1,pimax%20crystal&hl=en)

DK1 is so forgot about it's not even shown on most charts, which makes sense since it's literally a dev prototype.

Bro is cherrypicking to the point the only headset of the same gen as vision pro is the most low-cost thing on the market (quest 3). I can't believe someone is that eager to ride Tim's meat. You're not even paid for that."
2024-01-14,[removed]
2024-01-14,"I love these posts making apple seem like the best option, the difference is all of the headsets are on the market, or have been you can play games and use them in a number of different tasks. What does the apple vision pro have, well the promotional material and anything they said is gonna be in it. 

I really hope that most of you ain't that dumb to just blindly believe a company because they said something, look at the gaming industry all the big sharks have fallen below the single dev games made just for fun."
2024-01-14,"Resolution isn't even a big issue. I can't see imdividual pixels on the quest 3 no matter how much I try. Having a processor strong enough to use that reaolution everywhere is a bigger issue, and other bigger visual issues like the lens flare from the pancake lenses or the greyed blacks. Not sure how the vision pro is going to fix the issue with the pancake lens flare."
2024-01-14,"No Varjo no Pimax, no enterprise products, yeah pretty pointless comparison"
2024-01-14,"I have psvr2 and it has 2,000 x 2,040 pixels per eye. And even with this I can see the pixels. This is the only headset I have ever tried. I can't imagine how bad the rift's picture quality could be with 640x800 pixels."
2024-01-14,"It is such a pity Apple came so late to the party. I, personally, will never buy anything Apple but I wellcome this new Apple product. I don't consider this to be comparable to what is already out there. It is the first attempt to really make vr and ar interesting in a work and scientific environment. Imho the Quest pro was not what most people hoped it to be. Maybe this will be a breakthrough in that respect!"
2024-01-14,"For the price, I’d also expect a gold plated apple."
2024-01-14,"The external battery is such a fail, they should have mounted it on the back like the pico4"
2024-01-14,I'll get the Apple Vision 2 when it's only $1500
2024-01-15,"Funny you left out part of the original picture that had a varjo headset above it.. fanboy lol 

But still.. not taking anything away from it but it's not ""the biggest"" probably just the most expensive"
2024-01-17,"I love it when Apple fanboys, who are literally never going to buy one of these, post stuff like this.   Just buy a quest 3 and enjoy good VR for a good price now.  When Apple brings out their consumer version in 2 years time it will have quest 3 specs at 3 x the cost.  But at least you can enjoy your 1080p ""spatial"" (ie. 2010 era 3D) videos you've been collecting for years."
2024-01-14,"I am getting a kick out all the people butt-hurt because the chart does not contain the high-end PCVR headsets.

I am not the author, but I assume they were making a chart to compare *some well known* headsets with what Apple is releasing.

It is not a buying guide, it is a diagram made by someone interested in VR and in Apple's new hardware. If it contained all the headsets that exist they would all be bunched together and it would be an ugly mess. Feel free to make a chart with your favorite headset.

*Thank you all for the entertainment while I can't sleep. Feel free to ignore more. None of this is important.*"

2024-01-14,Which is precisely why it won't be able to do anything but look at 2D windows.
2024-01-14,Apple sucks
2024-01-14,This is like comparing a 1200 phone with a $300 cheap android.
2024-01-14,"11 million pixels per eye is crazy. I know the m2 is pretty powerful, but it’ll be limited being battery powered.
If they want to render natively, I’m not sure what it’ll be able to run beyond the more simple apps and of course playing videos (which it’ll be king at!)."
2024-01-14,RIP XR VR MR AR
2024-01-14,"It should be mentioned that both Rift DK1 (that should be made more clear) and Quest 2 don't even have that high of a resolution effectively cause they were using a single screen instead of two, losing a lot of pixel due to that."
2024-01-14,"This is a sad elitist chart of VR. Where only the ""accepted"" headsets are listed and everything else does not even exists."
2024-01-14,At least the resolution matches the price 😂
2024-01-14,Can you include more headsets and do a price per pixel?
2024-01-14,How are you going to include the Oculus Rift but not the [View-Master?!?](https://imgur.com/a/XgFruBr)
2024-01-14,Now put the prices of each.
2024-01-14,The Bigscreen Beyond has 2560 x 2560 pixels per eye at $1000
2024-01-14,And for sure ~~pcvr~~ **iConnect spatial computing** with Vision Pro is gonna be available on Macs only 💀 you smell this burning smell 🤣
2024-01-14,misleading post
2024-01-14,"What I really want to know is, what kind of GPU is going to be able to run these resolutions effectively? I doubt a 4090 could push that high of res and fps"
2024-01-14,"If the resolution of the Apple headset isn't confirmed, how to you go about assessing that this figure is pretty close?"
2024-01-14,Candy Crush in super HD?
2024-01-14,How do a product cost comparison to resolution lol
2024-01-14,Where cv1
2024-01-14,Oh so the bigscreen beyond which costs half the price and higher quality doesn't exist
2024-01-14,"Just curious, is it just me or is higher resolution kinda unnecessary at this point?

Like, with the Quest 3 the resolution (or rather the PPI) is at a point where i don't really need it to be any better. The only thing it really needs is higher FOV, better optics and more graphics power to do some anti-aliasing!"
2024-01-14,where is pimax
2024-01-14,OP getting dragged
2024-01-14,Now do FOV
2024-01-14,7x the price for less than 4x the pixels.
2024-01-14,High resolution is cool but it's the pixel density that is going to show you really improved clarity.  Unless the apple vision pro has tight pixels it's not going to look as stunning as we may hope.
2024-01-14,Valve Index🤣
2024-01-14,Now do the same but with their price tags instead of resolution
2024-01-14,Where's the psvr2 on this list
2024-01-14,Whoever posts this left out the two top headsets on the market .  Varjo and Pimax
2024-01-15,That scale would be much larger if comparing price.
2024-01-15,The resolution of Quest3 is already really good. It is not perfect for text but you can still buy Quest3 and several good 4K monitors for the price of a single AVP
2024-01-15,Is it worth it though? Apple is notorious for having locked down and overpriced products and I really dont want to be in a situation where I am fucked for buying it.
2024-01-15,"Apple here bragging and me here thinking ""$3500! It better be the best."""
2024-01-15,Fun fact! The resolution also matches the price :)
2024-01-15,Typical misleading apple advertising.
2024-01-15,You work for Apple?
2024-01-15,ok now compare it to Varijo and Pimax's 12K Super or Crystal. They're closer to the AVP in price.
2024-01-15,"punch ask future school unpack cagey wasteful badge ripe existence

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*"
2024-01-15,I love how theres a dk1 on here. Fair comparison :)
2024-01-15,And yet its FOV is lower than 500$ Quest 3
2024-01-16,Now do pixel per dollar.
2024-01-17,"Whenever I see ""AVP"" I read it as Aliens VS Predator"
2024-01-19,Where does it say that it's using a square resolution like this?
2024-02-06,"What if the lens and view port was enlarged to extend and wrap around the eyes (like Spiderman) using dual 8K OLED. That would certainly get rid of the huge border around our eyes and give us a wider peripheral view. Like a pair of glasses, you want so much lens that you don't even realize you're looking thru the VP glasses. Furthermore, if we look at a pair of shades, the glassware area is much larger than the eyes, to ensure coverage of most of the areas that we would see.  

When we look through those small lens, we see the V/AR world extend from that view point, but if the lens were extend beyond the eyes, the V/AR world would start from our peripheral view.

So I think bigger lens is the key.... bigger phone, bigger ipad screens. There's some precedence and prescience there.

Vision Pro Ultra anyone?"
2024-02-08,Walking on the street with it in Detroit or Chicago would be very bad idea
2024-01-14,"""Wow, these headsets that cost a tenth of the AVP also have a lower resolution! Apple is such an amazing innovator!"""
2024-01-14,Someone else posted this and OP cut off the Varijo XR4 which was better than AVP
2024-01-14,Yeah it’s funny because it’s comparing a 3 thousand dollar headset to a bunch of headsets that are 400-1000 dollars
2024-01-14,"Also the mobile M2 chip certainly wont render everything at 3400x3400.

The AVPs GPU has roughly 1.5x the performance of the Q3 but must render 2.5x as many frames. Therefore it wont always look like 3400x3400 pixels."
2024-01-14,You’re absolutely correct. The caveat is that nobody buys those. The comparison is looking at mainstream headsets.
2024-01-14,older and much much cheaper.
2024-01-14,He cropped it off from someone else’s post
2024-01-14,It will never be a mainstream headset. The VP will outsell it in the first hour.
2024-01-14,"It costs around 10 thousand dollars (the model with comparable PPD) +1700 subscription.

It doesn't make much sense to include XR-4 in any comparison with that price"
2024-01-14,"Even better, show a comparison of pixel per degree."
2024-01-14,"I don't know, maybe to make a chart of headsets that most people have actually heard of? Like it not, everyone has heard of the Valve and Meta headsets, and the Vision Pro.

It would be silly to add the G2 because it is not that popular AND it would be jammed in there with the Q3."
2024-01-15,"I think it's just meant to compare Apple's Vision to other mainstream headsets.  

If we started getting into the more obscure stuff, it might get visually cluttered. Also, the creator of the image may not have heard of them."
2024-01-14,"Because it contains the popular headsets that most VR folks have heard of because of VR's history or because they have sold in large volumes.

None of the more expensive headsets are that familiar to most people.

They also left off headsets like the Q-Pro and HP G2, I assume because their resolutions are so close to the Q3 they would just busy up the chart.

Want them on there? You are welcome to make your own chart."
2024-02-08,Probably because all of the headsets in that price range are industry exclusive or at the very least hard to get. If I wanted to buy a VR headset to play games this is exactly what I’d want. A list of headsets that are available for me and compared to other headsets in the same market.
2024-01-14,I haven't looked at whats out there since the Index.  What's considered the current generation Index upgrade?
2024-01-14,I assume that is because none of the headsets I assume you are talking about have sold enough or got enough press to be commonly known.
2024-01-14,AVP is its own PC and does not require one like every other one you mention.
2024-02-08,It’s more expensive and is pretty much purpose made for industry uses. Whilst the AVP is largely residential and although it is expensive it is not unreasonably so the only headsets better than it are more expensive than it. And the headset worse than it are also cheaper than it. And by quite a wide margin to. The AVP delivers industrial level quality whilst also being easier to buy. You can’t expect commercial quality for consumer prices that’s not how things work.
2024-01-14,"Agreed man, they should also include the prices of the headsets, there is also a lack of headsets with higher resolution to make it look like this is a very big step forward. Add pimax headsets, HTC and prices and then suddenly the Apple vision pro looks like shit for it's price"
2024-01-14,"Varjo XR-4 is selling for $4K. And without $3K desktop computer it does nothing on its own.

Apples and ora...Varjos."
2024-01-14,The varjo aero has 2880x2720 still a long shot from the vision pro
2024-01-14,I mean any headset that is not standalone should not be on this chart.
2024-01-14,Folks will include the Vario when it sells enough for more people to know what it is.
2024-01-14,"well its listing only mainstream popular headsets, not fringe group headsets. YES even pimax is not super popular outside simulator enthusiast."
2024-01-14,"No, the price is not comparable. XR-4 with AVP-level passthrough is much, much more expensive than AVP"
2024-01-14,"How many of those will ever be in customer hands? Maybe a few thousand? And they require a more technical knowledge, base stations, and a $3500 PCVR build on top of the asking price. 

Nobody is cross shopping those with AVP but everyone is asking themselves “how much better is this than the Quest 3”."
2024-01-14,"2160x2160, almost the same as Quest3 and identical to the Pico4."
2024-01-14,Mine is at the pawn shop now waiting for a new owner 😁
2024-01-14,"Probably a bit bigger than the Meta Quest 3, being native PCVR puts it further ahead in terms of clarity."
2024-01-14,It did not sell enough to matter. :p
2024-01-14,"I hear they’re only making 80k of these. It’s a glorified devkit. 1500 USD version within a couple of years, mark my words."
2024-01-14,"And even more importantly things to do in the headset that my existing OLED screens can't already do better:

Apple Vision Pro: ***

G2:******************

Quest 3:**********************"
2024-01-14,"Yeah, I'm literally 14 and I'm saving for a quest 3, I can even imagine saving for apple vision because it's TIMES 7 THE PRICE"
2024-01-14,"It's not comparable to other headsets though, it's more of a wearable Mac. So it's about regular high price for a Mac."
2024-01-14,"TBF, the Quest 3 is only that cheap because you also pay with your data. But yeah, the AVP is vastly overpriced."
2024-01-14,"You probably missed the release of Meta Quest Pro a year ago, when it costed 1700$ and provided more or less the same things as a Quest 3.

This being said, Apples Vision Pro is shipped with one of the fastest processors around and a dedicated co-processor in a sleek package. And current standalone champion Quest 3 can’t even offer proper browsing experience, not mentioning anything work related."
2024-01-14,"The what? :D

No one wants an overloaded chart. It is not a buying guide. It is a chart to compare popular VR headsets with what Apple has announced."
2024-01-14,Apple would prefer you use the term graphical longitude and latitude.
2024-01-14,Apple can't even run dx9 games on their laptops so it's not gonna be able to do pcvr at all.
2024-01-14,"Depends on what you mean with pcvr. It has the same processor as macbooks and imacs, so technically it has the power of a full computer. But realistically that is sort of moot because what is power if you don’t have a way to use it."
2024-01-14,"Virtual Desktop should legit release a 500$ version for the AVP, or make it a subscription because you can bet, Apple cultists will do anything..."
2024-01-14,I think we'll get Steam Link / ALVR pretty soon after release
2024-01-14,Lol the price is 7 quest 3s
2024-01-14,"I mean I agree, but more resolution?"
2024-01-14,It has native support for every iOS game every made.
2024-01-15,"FWIW, (3400×3400)÷(2064×2208)=approx 2.536, so more like 2.5x resolution.

Still not 7x though, of course."
2024-01-15,Not to mention even lower FOV. It's going to look like scuba diving mask even more so than budget headsets.
2024-01-14,"Having no controllers definitely is a compromise, I guess a lot of games won't be playable due to that"
2024-01-14,">no compromises

So i can use it with my pc to game on it? Right? Right???"
2024-01-14,"It's made out of metal and glass and by all accounts as heavy as fuck. 

Probably why it has a tiny battery life, otherwise people would be suing them for chronic neck pain. 

Oh, and it doesn't work with any existing ecosystems or software. 

Taking the piss out of them aside, I am sure it is going to have its fans and good points. But it is certainly not a no compromise headset."
2024-01-14,3500$ isn't an opportunity.
2024-01-14,"No compromises? Show me the controllers. Show me the PC support. Show me the open app availablility. Show be the good price-to-performance. Show me the small form factor. It even has a seperate battery pack on a cable.

These are all compromises."
2024-01-14,AR!? Did you mean Spatial Computing? Apple cultists should really be careful with this one...
2024-01-14,"I think a lot of people are pissed because it's a no compromise AR headset, not VR and doesn't focus on games since the input is hand tracking and eye tracking, no controllers. I'm intrigued to see what it is capable of, I just don't see most people having a use for it with its limited use cases at launch."
2024-01-14,"""a no compromises headset""

You sir, are a class A tier troll. That's fantastic."
2024-01-14,"I don't understand people being _pissed_, I do understand them being disappointed. The vast majority of both this sub and existing VR in general seems to be heavily PCVR focused, so it would have been awesome to see demos of this hooked up to Steam playing our favourite games on it like most other headsets. However, it's just a totally different product with a totally different target market, which most existing VR enthusiasts don't (currently/may never) subscribe to.

It will be an impressive bit of kit and I'm glad to see more big players investing in the industry, Apple can help push the tech that everyone else will benefit from as well as get more people interested in VR/AR.

People saying how amazing and groundbreaking it is before it's been released, reviewed, and some actual inspiring use cases found are equally cringe."
2024-01-14,"It was predictable. People like to feel special. When Apple enters a market, all of the people who previously were milling around in that niche no longer get to feel special and unique, because now *anyone* can do it. And tech enthusiasts friggin' ***hate*** that. 

""Ew, we're not like those *normies.* It should be illegal to enjoy VR/AR/XR/SC/whatever unless you can rattle off tech specs for 15 competitors. Recognizing that cherry-picked tech specs, viewed in isolation of the actual device and experience, are pointless is just a thing for Apple shills.""

Being forced to acknowledge that Apple does more than just ""marketing"" is worse than death to some people."
2024-01-14,"Not having 6DOF tracking controller for PSCVR is a HUGE compromise to the audience that you are talking about.

They are all put off by the fact that Apple does not consider it a VR headset."
2024-01-14,Because you can do anything with it. Macs can’t game and it can’t connect with a pc due to apple not allowing that. Now you have a 3.5k paperweight with the second best specs on the market
2024-01-14,"It looks uncomfortable as fuck, it's probably a closed garden, you cannot use for PCVR it doesn't have controllers, and it probably doesn't even have VR games available...

It's probably just a glorified Chromebook but in AR..."
2024-01-14,"It's not ""truly great"" because some apple marketing morons say so. The OLED screens are probably good, everything else about this device looks like a total piece of shit."
2024-01-15,With such tiny FOV it definetely does make a lot of of compromises even compared to budget headests like Quest 3
2024-01-14,Honestly I'd prefer Windows 3.1 to MetaOS. At least the native Windows 3.1 apps *worked*.
2024-01-14,"But I spend almost none of my time in there Quest looking at the OS. I spend it playing games, which I mostly won't be able to do on AVP.


Software matters, but you can't sell devices with a good OS alone. AVP needs a killer app and I don't think it's clear what that would be right now."

Edit: no it's not, it's 2000x2040p"
2024-01-14,"Quest Pro has 1800x1920 per eye resolution, so slightly lower resolution than Quest 2, but it has pancake lenses and QLED screens with local dimming, so better black levels than standard LCD.

Vive XR Elite has slightly higher resolution, 1920x1920 so about 5% higher resolution than Quest Pro, but it has standard LCD displays so not as good black levels as Quest Pro."
2024-01-14,It is not a buying guide.
2024-01-14,"Megapixels mattered in the early days (which I'm going to define as the early 2000s) when cameras were shipping without enough of them. But it continued to be the comparison long after it was a number you had to look at.


I think VR resolution has fallen into the same trap. I remember trying the OG Vive and struggling to make out the sights on the gun in Arizona Sunshine. At that time, it was something that mattered and needed to be better.


But on current gen headsets it's just not an issue."
2024-01-14,"I mean as far as comfort goes...Apple has likely put a lot more work into comfort than most anyone else, simply because they have the resources and experience to do so. 

How that translates to the actual headset, we'll find out soon enough.

It's a bit different from the megapixel wars given that it's replacing your very-high-megapixel human vision with a screen. There it actually matters.

I would agree that it's not the *most* important thing when it comes to gaming - you don't need high fidelity to have awesome and memorable games. But for any kind of productivity task it becomes pretty critical. Same for high-quality passthrough.

If it sucks, it sucks, but I'm still excited to try one out - and definitely excited about the increased pace of development and investment in the VR/AR space that's likely to follow."
2024-01-14,"LOL... it will run every existing iOS app AND it will record and play full 3D video right out of the box. 

Folks are not going to have trouble finding uses for it, it just isn't a PCVR gaming headset."

2024-02-01,"I'm curious, as a guy who's best res is an index and a Quest 3, using a 3080 with an !7 and 32gb ram; what do you use to power the Pimax Crystal? Would a (now) lower-tier system even run it? Honest question; I have 13 days to evaluate and return me AVP, and I am well aware of the Bigscreen and the Crystal; but i have smoothly-operational PCVR choices with my current setup. I'd have to upgrade PCs to run a Crystal, correct?"

And the thing to keep in mind is that most of that circle is actually made up of companies buying headsets for enterprise use. I can’t see that demographic buying the Apple headset. I really can’t see there being that many Apple fans willing to drop thousands on something that isn’t a phone or computer that they use every day.

Would it really hirt your comparisom against knowm devices? It would not it would just need some fair needed context to the data visualization.

2024-01-14,"Correct. Even the HTC Vive Pro 2 is missing. That headset has a resolution per eye of 2448 x 2448. The full kit is about $1200 on the HTC site, but you can buy used kits on Ebay for about 650-700 ish $ now."
2024-01-14,"Well at least Vario is selling and we have confirmed specs...

Not to mention the apple arm performance with that resolution is unknown. But apple will surely sell you a desktop to run... Oh wait...."
2024-01-14,Varjo does come with controllers too. But yeah no computer. AT same time it means you can hook it up to powerful PC to do stuff AVP won’t be able to do. So people who need that power for their VR applications the AVP is a dead end.
2024-01-14,"The VARJO is still a better deal, because at least you can do something with it, like play games, or run a professional flight sim. I doubt there will be that many usable VR/AR/SC/XR apps on launch of the Vision Pro. The VARJO is also tethered to a PC, so it's always going to be more powerful than the Apple VP or any other standalone headset."
2024-01-15,"If your buying a 4k headset then chances are you already have a high end computer. And even if you are dead set on stand alone, the apple headset probably won't have porn which is a big downer."

My best friend is a diehard apple fan whos already into VR and he cant even justify buying it with that price. I definitely cant afford a $3500+ headset, and even if I could I would rather put that money towards a new PC. Just hard for many people to justify spending that much on a headset.

2024-01-14,Yeah because Apple (or any other major tech company) definitely doesn't collect our data.

2024-01-14,Wow! This is worthless!
2024-01-14,"\>It's made out of metal and glass and by all accounts as heavy as fuck.

Are you insane? At 450g, the AVP is one of the lightest VR headsets ever made.

\>Probably why it has a tiny battery life

Yeap, you're just insane. The AVP has 2\~2,5h of battery life while supporting the M2+R1 chips, which makes the headset, by a WIDE margin, the undisputed leader in processing capabilities among standalone headsets while supporting this processing power by at least two hours with its battery.

\>Oh, and it doesn't work with any existing ecosystems or software.

LMAO. There's no such thing as an ""existing ecosystem."" Having an application to buy games and a proprietary web browser is not an ""ecosystem."" The Vision OS is the very first operational system made specifically for VR as the medium. Simulating a Windows desktop with third-party applications that you bought in your game store is also not an OS."
2024-01-14,"Metal and glass can both be *lighter* than the plastic structure needed to achieve the same strength and/or stiffness. Everyone likes to pick on metal as being automatically inferior to plastic where weight is concerned...problem is that's completely false. 

Which accounts are those? Compared to the Bigscreen I guess it's fair to say it's heavy, but by all accounts I've seem it weighs around the same as a Quest 3. I've yet to see that described as ""heavy as fuck."" 

Steam exists on the Mac, so I would think it's at least compatible with that (even if limited by the uncertain controller situation and currently-limited Mac-OS game selection). The ecosystem of existing Apple users isn't exactly a niche, I suspect they'd be fine with being limited to just that target market."
2024-01-14,"So what you are saying it's not compromised, as long as you don't care that it can't do the things it's competitors can. Because it's not a competitor, it's not VR/AR/MR, it's ""spacial computing"" and regardless of where Apple sets the goalposts, the fans will cheer and hail it as revolutionary, despite it just being nothing more than a higher resolution version of something that's already on the market for 1/6th the price, except you know, lacking software support and a price so high and a such a small planned user base (based on shipment estimates), that it's almost guaranteed that all early adopter devs will lose money."
2024-01-14,"I think eventually it will focus on games, but they really need time for this. Think about it: 

-	Apple has best performance per watt in their chips, and M2 is way more powerful than anything else on headsets market.

-	Their own DLSS / Framegen

-	They have experience with Airplay / Continuity. It’s early to say such things, but they really can do a proper “PCVR” with this. Just imagine seamless PCVR without “bridges” like Oculus Link, Steam Link and Steam Home VR that feels native

I'm really excited about all that, to be honest - and every VR enthusiast should. Competition is always good, at least."
2024-01-14,"And collectively, every single one of those people could boycott Apple, refuse to ever engage with or buy any of their vision products, and...

Apple wouldn't even notice. Because the active part of that demographic is tiny.

That's what this sub and a lot of VR ""enthusiasts"" don't seem to comprehend. The world is a lot bigger than them, and they don't have some god-given birthright to be catered to by anyone that makes VR/AR/XR/whatever products. 

I have a few VR headsets, I'm into VR and flat-screen games when I have time - as I have been my whole life. I'm interested in the Vision Pro too, and ""gaming"" is the *last* reason I'm interested in it.

Even if I was interested in gaming and didn't want it...that's fine. I'm patient enough to wait for the inevitably increased pace of development in the VR space that comes incumbents get shaken up by a new entry. Meta et al are nervous about the Vision Pro, despite how much people around here dismiss it. That's a **good** thing for everyone that does care about VR for gaming and won't ever buy an Apple headset.

It's literally a win-win for everyone."
2024-01-14,"AVP is intended to be a computer. Nobody around here asks what the ""killer app"" is that might convince them to buy a desktop or laptop. Because there **isn't** a ""killer app."" The killer app is whatever you need it for. What counts as a killer app for someone will depend on whether they're an engineer, an accountant, a lawyer, a graphic designer, etc. 

It's not geared towards gaming, and that's OK, because not **everything** needs to be dedicated to gaming, and there are a *lot* more people out there using computers for things besides gaming. 

Gamers act like everyone who doesn't exclusively view their hardware purchases through the lens of ""suitability for more gaming"" are a niche minority. Nope. That's exactly backwards."
2024-01-14,Thanks.
2024-01-14,I didn't say it was and I don't think it is. What it is is a marketing ploy perpetuated by fanboys.
2024-01-14,"Apple putting a lot more work in comfort is an assumption. The usual process is annual or bi-annual iteration with a glimpse of innovation to justify next buy (tech as a trend/fashion). Now Apple has to compromise this iteration process and have a really good first year device, because they are behind and need to play catch up.

But this tiny advance cycle is not just Apple, many other corporations do this (Samsung, etc.) but Apple is particularly talented at that.

And, just like with the camera wars, pixel count is tiny bit of the relevant parameters. Pixels\*FOV do give you a better sense of image quality (too much FOV for a given res and it'll look blurry even for super high resolutions, low FOV and image will look crisp even with low res). And then there's also the lens quality / compromises (soft spot vs accuracy vs weight vs size vs...). And then also pixel composition. etc.

Point being, oversimplifying to screen resolution is handy for marketing purposes (specially if you are in the top end) but should not be the definite parameter to consider, not by a long shot. Actually just thinking on the spot that a 'Fixels' (FOV to pixel ratio or something like that) parameter would be better suited. Fixels per second and you get display refresh rate too... xD I'm making this overcomplicated and that's no good for marketing strategies.

That said, I have no doubt the Vision is going to be a high quality device. But I think the quality/price ratio will be noticeably lower than other alternatives. Because that's how Apple operates, high quality status devices with small improving iterations.

Being their first year product, it is unlikely they will mess up with things like an antenna-gate or charging port at the bottom of the mouse. But it could happen. VR is particularly tricky.

It doesn't make economic sense for this brand to do amazing innovation. They already have massive user base (and established tech image), so they just have to keep the interest, with minimal effort/cost. Their focus is on fashion and status (polish and quality being a requirement to keep up on such leads).

As for your last point. Given how tiny the initial production runs are for the Vision, it's unlikely they'll move the development needle: most devs don't play risky games with small user bases so most developments will be cross-platform (and actually getting ROI mostly from the larger existing user bases) unless paid by the brand."
2024-01-14,"No, I wasn't assuming anyone asking me to do so either, I chose to out my feelings about the device by comparing purchasing it to other things that I have previously gotten and comparing it to other headsets on the market. It was more of a general statement as to what the apple vision had over other headsets that would even come close to justifying the price."
2024-02-01,"I cannot give you a conclusive answer to this as I haven't used my crystal on any other PC system other than my RX 7900XTX, 7950X3D with 64gb of ddr5. You'd have to look at other people's up to date reviews (last 2-3 months) to get an accurate read. It also depends on if you're using DFR (Dynamic foveated rendering) as it helps a lot"
2024-01-14,You think people who haven't even considered AR/VR will pay 3k+ for something they're not even sure they need with much cheaper options on the market?
2024-01-14,nothing new. I've been an apple hater for over a decade at this point.
2024-01-14,"Oh no don't get me wrong, not talking about this one at all just in general, whenever I see posts similar to this I see apple people making it seem like a godsend headset, not talking about the op or this post in general."
2024-01-14,"LOL... Nice try. No one gives a shit. The OP included the headsets **they** consider popular.

The G2 line is not on that list, has been abandoned by HP, and will die with WMR in 2026.

*Edit...*

I switched ""the well know headsets"" to ""some well known headsets"" just for you. But that still does not make the G2 matter in this context."

It shows nothing else. Anything else you think it says, you are projecting, because it literally says nothing else. 

No one that knows anything about VR thinks that resolution is the most important thing."
2024-01-14,"It just shows the effect of group thinking. Reality is restricted.

Like adding devices like Pimax Crystal, that would be the highest end commercial device. That is double the Quest3 resolution, and a bit over half of Apples device.

To me that would fit there just nicely."
2024-01-14,"Apple won't be for gaming, my guess is they will focus on the designer/productivity market. Sure there will probably be some games, but if they hold to their controller-less mentality, I doubt they will be very indepth."

But you're right that the other two are much better comparisons for high-end headsets. The Crystal is a little over half the resolution for a little under half the price (but with no AR/passthrough capabilities), and the XR4 is a higher resolution at a higher price (but no standalone capability)."

2024-01-14,"Yeah, I believe Apple is launching Vision Pro to see if the audience will figure out killer use cases for it (Kind like Meta does with MR on Quest 3, but at least VR on Quest 3 is a known feature set).

For Vision Pro it's kinda conflicted, they put it in ""Pro"" category, but showcase mostly watching movies and videos and no actual professional use-case.

Well they still might figure it out later. With correct APIs and some Apple magic it can compete with Varjo headsets once professionals get familiar with it."
2024-01-14,"Yeah, go ahead and bet against it and let us know how that works out for you. 

This is Apple, and their marketing folks will have no problem selling this device to business and creatives. *(They literally sell an aluminum monitor stand that is $999.)* By this time next year it will be an Apple fan badge of honor to say that your work bought you one. It is priced the same as a high-end laptop, so I don't see them sitting on the shelves.

What will happen after the first year? No idea, but that first batch of 80K devices might as well already be sold as status symbols for the Apple faithful.

*Edit... and no, I will not be buying one. There are only two Apple devices in our house. My wife's iPad for work, and the iPad I bought to learn iOS so I could help her if needed. I don't really like Apple. I think they are smug bullys.*"
2024-01-14,"You dont see them because they dont exist. And apple knows that. The target group for the vision pro 1 is not the average consumer. Its apples first headset after years of developing it. The developments costs are incredible high and they need that money back to an extend. But as you've already said, there wont be many people, even apple fans who are willing to buy a device they dont really feel the ""need"" for. Thats why apples vision pro 1 is supposed to create that ""need"". The amount of money they need to get back, cant be accumulated when targeting the average consumer because VR or ""spacial computing"", while massively increasing in popularity, is rn in the process of leaving its niche. The raw development costs would make the headset  in the 1000-2000$ range anyway. A price that still wont be payed by the majority for a piece of technology they dont know what to expect off. 

Thats why they target people with money, large influence or developers with the vision pro 1, in order for these people to advertise the headset to the masses and create the ""need"" it the head of consumers. Then once the masses are hooked and know about what can be done with such a device they want one too. This is when apple will release their vision pro 2 thats much cheaper and targeted at the average consumer.

Apple knows that barely any average consumer or apple fanboy is willing to pay, even only the pure development costs of the headset for a piece or hardware they have yet to discover. When buying an Iphone, you know what you're getting. You have your expectations and they're usually met. This doesnt go for VR for many many people.

Its partly apples motto aswell to first create the need, than sell a solution to that need."

God, these people are delusional. They want you to believe that the garbage software present in META's HMDs today is even remotely comparable to what Apple presented (lmao). It's a level of gaslighting that should be impossible, but here we are.

"" a price so high""

You simply don't have the slightest idea of what you're talking about. The displays present in the AVP alone have a higher price tag than the best current META headset market price. Just the proprietary tracking used to operate the OS took Apple TEN YEARS to develop. But it's impossible for you to understand R&D costs since you think that the software in the Quest 3 is comparable to the actual OS that Apple built.

BTW, there's absolutely no standalone HMD on the market that is even remotely comparable to the AVP. Again, you just have no idea of what you're talking about."

Jebeus. Apple did not make it. It is not marketing."
2024-01-14,"Not much of an assumption...I'm familiar with their process, and how it compares to a few other companies. Lay people (e.g. not product design engineers that work at these companies) tend to grossly underestimate the amount of effort that goes into seemingly simple things. They do the same when it comes to importance of clear leadership and the general company ethos. Google or Meta \*could\* do what Apple does, in theory. They just...don't. And they won't, for a long time, because they simply don't have the same kind of focus and process in place, and don't recognize the ethos at Apple. And at this point there is so much experience and tribal knowledge accumulated at Apple that it's extremely difficult to make up just by throwing money at it - it'll require a fundamental change in leadership and values, and a lot of time.

>The usual process is annual or bi-annual iteration with a glimpse of innovation to justify next buy (tech as a trend/fashion).

Not really. There's no sinister scheme to manipulate people by holding back technology that's ready for mass-production, just because. This is another conspiratorial assumption people make. If iPhone iterations seem too incremental, it's because it's a very mature product category. Apple's goal is to create products and then refine them. Not to throw out 50 things a year to see what sticks. I appreciate companies that do that too, because it's interesting, but that doesn't mean it's the ""correct"" or only way to innovate. Most of the R&D done at Apple isn't seen (or even acknowledged) by the public - because they don't kick out half-baked products just to justify R&D. If a particular thing isn't up to the standard they set for rolling out to mass-production - it stays in R&D until it is.

>they are behind and need to play catch up.

This is a motive you're assigning to them, as many are. From the perspective of a company the size of Apple, and their general goal of appealing to a mainstream audience, they don't feel the need to play catch-up because the race has barely started and they have an ability to execute that few companies can match - nevermind in the VR space. Crucially - they're not trying to appeal to current VR enthusiasts, the overwhelming majority of whom only care about it for gaming. And the majority of whom also end up putting their headset on a shelf to collect dust and barely touching it after the initial ""wow cool"" phase. I've got three VR headsets, I've given several dozen people their first intro the VR. Without exception, everyone is blown away.

And also without exception - none of them ask for advice on getting their own, ever end up getting their own, or ever ask to try it again in the future. There are many reasons for that - and none of those reasons are ""not enough games."" *That* is what Apple is trying to address. Whether they succeed or not is anyone's guess, but I appreciate that they are trying when nobody else seems to be in any meaningful capacity.

Gaming is a subset of ""what can be done with VR/AR/XR,"" not the whole thing. So far, very few companies have even bothered to make an effort on that front. You have gaming on one end, niche industrial applications on the other end (and associated price tags/hassle), and that's about all so far.

>And, just like with the camera wars, pixel count is tiny bit of the relevant parameters.

I could not agree more. Which is why everyone who picks a few specs, neglects the rest of the headset and experience, and uses it to argue one way or another is missing the point.

I definitely agree with you that considering resolution without considering FOV is a mite misleading, or at least incomplete. PPD + FOV would be a far more complete metric. Incidentally, this is why Apple has some weird resolutions on Macbooks. They target a minimum pixel density/pitch, without regard to the overall resolution. Likely they did something similar in choosing the resolution for the VP (of course other hardware limits exist), which means that it's a good bet that the PPD figure of the VP is what Apple considers the minimum required for the experience they want, and are unlikely to ever drop below that.

>But I think the quality/price ratio will be noticeably lower than other alternatives. Because that's how Apple operates, high quality status devices with small improving iterations.

Disagree on this point, but that's ok. The build quality of Apple stuff tends to be second-to-none in the consumer electronics space. A *lot* of work goes into these things. It depends what you mean by ""quality"" though. The VP is legitimately expensive to manufacture, and there's a reason it's expensive. Whatever someone thinks of Apple - Apple's *vendors* don't get to mark things up just for the brand clout. I like to think of the word ""overpriced"" in an engineering sense, i.e. based on what it actually cost to engineer and manufacture. A $2,000 lamp is ""overpriced"" in the sense that you don't need to spend that much just to make light, but not necessarily overpriced in a ""you could make exactly the same thing for $50"" sense. Bad example since most fancy lamps are still built shoddily, but you get the idea.

Vision Pro is *expensive,* no question. To be overpriced it would need to be a cheap headset that's sold at a huge markup, and that certainly doesn't seem to be the case. It is actually expensive to build. And that's fine - I don't know why this sub is so offended by that so often. There are plenty of expensive things that most people can't afford that nobody gets upset about.

>It doesn't make economic sense for this brand to do amazing innovation. They already have massive user base (and established tech image), so they just have to keep the interest, with minimal effort/cost.

That's not really their ethos. If it was they never would have gotten to where they are to begin with. It makes perfect economic sense if they genuinely believe that this will be a huge market in the future - and given the investment into this space it seems like they do.

>Their focus is on fashion and status (polish and quality being a requirement to keep up on such leads).

That's not the focus of the engineering teams at Apple. Apple has a larger R&D budget than most countries. They have more teams of PHD scientists than most university research centers. Those people do things. There is a **lot** of innovation at Apple. The bulk of it, like literally all innovation in history, is not flashy new consumer-facing features, but fundamental improvements to materials, manufacturing methods, optics, sensors, semiconductors, and a million other things.

Without these things, few of the things consumers do recognize as ""innovations,"" according to them, would be possible. 4K flat-panel displays existed in 2000. They also required two video cards to drive, cost almost $20k, served as heaters, and had poor refresh rates and viewing angles. Everything in between those early displays, and the cheap and excellent 4k displays we have today are the result of ""incremental"" innovations. Consumers being consumers, they mostly don't really care, appreciate, or respect much of this kind of necessary work. They just want the new check-box cool feature.

That's understandable. Yes - for sure Apple is a status brand in many ways, and they're aware of this. Part of the reason they *get* to be a status brand is because their engineering teams are capable of delivering on the promise that Apple makes. They walk the walk. Marketing doesn't drive engineering at Apple, regardless of what people who have never been near this world want to believe.

If anything, ID drives engineering - and their focus is on user experience. They first determine what they believe an ideal user experience should be - whether it's a smartphone, or a headset, or earpods, or whatever - and then the engineers work backwards to determine what technologies, manufacturing methods, process refinements, etc are needed to enable that. If they all exist, they can make the product. If a bunch are missing - that's where R&D comes in. VP is notable because it's a relative rarity at Apple that products get shipped when ID isn't happy about them, on account to being limited by the current state of technology.

>As for your last point. Given how tiny the initial production runs are for the Vision, it's unlikely they'll move the development needle: most devs don't play risky games with small user bases so most developments will be cross-platform (and actually getting ROI mostly from the larger existing user bases) unless paid by the brand.

Fair point. We're going to find out soon if the Apple brand/promise was enough to sway devs. I'm pretty excited. Worth mentioning that pretty much the entire library of iOS/iPad apps should be available on the VP at launch, but personally I don't care about those and they probably aren't a huge draw for most people. I'm far more interested in desktop apps - especially those specifically designed (or re-designed) to take full advantage of the VP. That and VR video and (hopefully) workflows that aren't a colossal PITA, as they currently are. 

I try to not predict the future too much. There's any number of ways this can go, and a lot of IMHO underappreciated potential markets for VR that the incumbents simply don't serve at all (sports, for one). I'm just here for the ride and excited about where it goes."

2024-01-14,Apple Watch say Hi
2024-01-15,For the Apple Vision Pro to compete with the high end VARJO headset it would need to have the ability to be hooked up to an external computer with a high end GPU in it. The VARJO headsets are used by the US Air force for some of their new pilot flight training. How can Apple possibly compete with that? The first step in competing with a manufacturer like VARJO would be for Apple management to even understand what VARJO does. I'm not even convinced that the executives at Apple have even heard of VARJO.  I doubt that they've even thought about any applications beyond the rich consumer market yet.
2024-01-14,"Businesses don’t buy without support contractors, and apple hasn’t done anything there. Apple is selling to consumers, Varjo is selling to companies/the military/intelligence branches.

Varjo will easily outsell it because it’s both higher spec and already has all the corporate clients."
2024-01-14,Bet against it?? What are you talking about? windows users want VR too!
2024-01-14,That's a great site thanks for sharing.
2024-01-14,That's exactly the reason why nobody should actually buy it yet. There is nothing to use the headset for. Even a reviewer would be hard pressed to find a way to test it to review if there is nothing to run on it. LOL
2024-01-14,"Well, if you want to compare the Vision Pro to a headset of Comparable resolution you could compare it to the VARJO. The VARJO would win. There are people who buy this headset to play games on a PC. The Apple Vision pro can't even be tethered to a PC to utilize the high powered GPU in a PC. Compared to the VARJO, the Apple Vision Pro is just a prototype / tech demo, which is really what it actually is. 

&#x200B;

I'd still rather use a lower powered headset from the chart like the Quest 3, because it's cheaper, and can actually be used for something, like playing games."

It's not a thing of prefrence.. It's a thing of making honest non missleading data visualization. Why compare something when the comaprison is missleading or faulty? It worries me that you don't understand that...

>some random person made for fun.

You say this like we are all too stuck up for not leting it go. When it's you who is defending obvious missleading data to suit your cult apple bias.

When you make a data visualizatiom where most known headsest take up 1/2th of a box and the VP the other half by itself while comparing resolution it is pretty obvious too all that are not dumb or brainwashed or egotistical that that is trying to imply that the VP is the best. That is missleading when you don't compare other products in that price range.

2024-01-14,"You are still wrong, kid. But this discussion serves no purpose."
2024-01-15,"You are making very solid points. Thank you for your time.

Apple participating in the VR space is likely to make a (positive) mark in the industry. Given their scale, them involved on anything can cause market shift. We'll see, definitely interesting future with such giant joining the party.

Also, thinking about it, one of the biggest challenges in VR is ergonomics for the masses. Making a product that fits perfectly to most people in the world, with their big and small noses, spread eyes, weak VR legs, ... etc. In that sense, Apple has an edge because they invest a lot on comfort/ergonomics/ease of use (yeah, my comment on that being an assumption was off).

In that regard, they will eventually have to do like Big Screen and develop a customization service for perfect ergonomics (eg. custom print face holder). This level of customization will become industry standard for many sectors in the upcoming years... I think... I hope.

Definitely, making something as simple and as fool proof as possible requires an amazing amount of work that stays hidden behind an intuitive and easy to use interface. The problem for some (a minority?) users is that this often means limiting flexibility and personalization, specially when it comes to Apple... but that's one of my personal quarrels :P

Can't completely agree regarding innovation. But yes, you make a very good point regarding 'hidden' innovations through investing in new manufacturing processes, materials and the likes.

But to me it makes a lot of sense for big corporate to avoid risks with strong innovation. That's the space or gamble for dynamic small enterprises, start-ups and the like. Those drive the revolution, take the risk... might win or fail big time, but definitely will guide the big guys (who then buy the verified result, or just pirate it)

Apple has had several occasions where it delayed integrating standards that had been around (on Android, for example) for years (most recently adding RCS, using usb-c, ...). And I see this as innovation holding (on topics which at certain point are not innovation anymore), just keeping things on the list to have a slightly new product for the next year.

Here there can be other factors like stubbornness of considering their approach always best or to protect their ecosystems, or just being cheeky/spoiled... or r/IAmTheMainCharacter (this is what comes to mind when I think of Jobs and his cars without license plates).

As for the quality/price ratio. My point is that they do very high quality products (most of the time) but the mark up price is disproportionate to the development costs. Because price actually is part of their marketing, their status symbol. With the added benefit of raking up a lot of extra cash. This is the feel I get when I compare products on similar quality level but disparaging price. And I say 'feel' because it is a complex analysis to objectively review dev cost vs product price. Subjectively, I do not care about an aluminum machining process that decreases weight/size by 10% if that costs me 30% more."
2024-01-14,"I've never owned an apple device, and I've heard from people how hard it is to switch to something different because of the way Apple locks you into their products. I don't like the way they price things in their ecosystem. They're constant battle to stop you from even repairing one of their devices. They seem very anti-consumer when compared to most companies, only caring about how you use their devices rather than IF you use them. Apple knows you're going to use their devices, they're always more concerned with monitoring your experience."
2024-01-14,"> Lol do you understand you can't just ""consider"" out of your ass and pretend objective reality doesn't exist?

Yes, yes I can can. Everyone does it all the time.

We are talking about the preferences of a person that made a graph. Their preferences are 100% **subjective** and your opinion on the matter does not even come into play.

What is popular depends on whose opinion you are talking about. And we are talking about the individual who made the graph.

Notice that the post is not titled ""The most popular VR headsets as voted on by reddit.""

They did not submit an academic paper. They posted a cool diagram with some headsets they consider popular.

They never even drew any conclusions, they simply listed some headsets and their resolutions. What exactly are you so up in arms about?

***Nowhere did the OP claim they were listing all the popular headsets.***"
2024-02-07,It has the M2 same thing as the MacBook Pro
2024-01-18,"Because apple knows that their customer base is deluded. Selling them the same phone for decades, with tiny improvement was all the evidence they needed."
2024-01-15,"$250? Nah, at AVP pricing, I'm expecting $1000 for the pair. But they'll be really good controllers at least .-.

Idk, we will have to see. Apple seemed very anti-controller in their marketing for the AVP imo."
2024-02-26,"Well yeah, if you want to look solely at gaming-capable devices, sure. In fact if we take a look at a few recent statistics it looks like there are roughly 2.5 billion Android devices in the world as of early 2024. iPhone is at around 2.3 billion. One other number I saw from 2022 is that there were an estimated 1.4 billion windows users at the time. These are all crazy high numbers of course, and many of those users will never game on their device. Just in the room I'm sitting in right now, there are 13 phones and tablets of various operating systems and models, but only one has been used for gaming in the past 2 years (my current one), the rest were used at one point in the past (and donated), or else were bought solely for other purposes.

So yeah, iPhone can be used for games, and I know a lot of people do regularly use them for gaming.

My point with what I said is that the AVP in its current iteration is not likely to be used for gaming by more than a very small percentage of users. The lack of controllers removes a ton of potential from any games developed for the platform and is really the key kicker imo. Hand tracking is great, but there's only so much you can do with it at the moment. 

If Apple were to release a new headset down the road with controllers, or release controllers that work with the headset, I may change my perspective, but until that happens I'll stick with my standpoint that Apple's headsets are gonna focus on media and productivity."

Wait so you do agree it is missleading? You just admited it. You said that it dosen't matter that it's wrong because he had fun making it.

Well yea ok he had fun. I'm proud of him. 🎉
But people on the internet need to correct what they belive is wrong and missleading... Do you not agree? 


>They did not claim that their graph is a good representation of all VR headsets. They did not make any claims about its validity at all. Attempting to hold it to that standard is a waste of time. 

Tjey didn't but that's how it came across to a lot of people even you. You were defending it in other comments by saying ""they are shown as the best because they have marketing and people know it"" there by admiting that you acknowladge the point of yhe post was to show how AVP is the best. 

>I am turning on notification for this thread as you are just repeating yourself.

No dude you are repeating yourself never answering my questions not listening to others. Tipical boomer...

Answer my question in this comment:

""People om the internet should point out missleading diagrams, figures, media... Do you not agree?""

Your respons repeating yourself will ofcourse be:
""He had fun it dosnt matter if its missleading"" 
That has nothing to do with what I'm asking and is dodging the question. Answer: 

""People om the internet should point out missleading diagrams, figures, media... Do you not agree?"""

You did in thia thread by saying ""yeah it might not be the nest visuakization but he had fun""

And by ""They are shown as the best because they have the most recognitiom go to your bar and ask... "" 
 
That was you admiting that you belove it shows AVP as the best. 


Also what's the point of a visuakization then if it just shows AVP vs some inferior devices in a different price range? Oh yeah right ""for fun"" and you again pribbably won't answer my repsonse which is ""it can be for fun "" but don't you think people should wnat to correct it even if it's ""for fun""? 
Also your response being it's for fun to my question of why someone would want to visualize it like that is admiting that the diagram is showing missleading data but I really don't think you are straight up cable enoihh to get that. Because like:

You seem to be a tipical boomer. Always has to be right about everything. Always thinks he is the smartest aboit evwryrhing. Dosen't listen to new ideas. If he does he dosn't respectfull engage in them by answering questions just dodges questions with irelevent stuff like ""for fun"" but then dosn't conitnue to answer like ""shouldn't for fun be critiqued?"" Then proceeds to name call and didge the question again. Too stuck uo your ass to listen to what people are trying to tell you.

You simply can't, the only 2 major things Quest 3 doesn't have is Micro OLED + Eye tracking.... Meanwhile Quest 3 at least doesn't need battery hanging from it, it have Battery integrated into it"
2024-01-28,"The problem not which is faster, on paper M2 is but reality is what's the use case of that? Normally it's on rendering and gaming, however until now not a single thing shown that says ""Quest 3 can't do that""...... Because AVP lacks the content to do just that hence the focus on 2D content than 3D.

As for R1 and M2 without a doubt when you are in MR you losing performance because of tracking and best example is Xreal Air using Nebula on PC how much it uses processing to get screen fixed in place, but there's a missing info people forget about it...... This is only applicable in passthrough mode, but in VR mode you don't actually lose much performance due to tracking.... 

I won't treat having M2 as a big thing, yes not any processor achieves that many pixels rendered even for 2D content, but as I mentioned on my other comment beyond Quest 3 you won't notice a night to day difference with clarity, it's like 4K to 8K TV you won't notice much, Quest 3 already hits 4K content output, and the sad reality not much content is beyond 4K to make use of that many pixels..... You can only upscale it and use Micro OLED subpixels to improve on that but again difference won't feel that big

So overall M2 is not really an exciting part for me, we losing some features like Wifi 7 or 6E over Wifi 6 AVP have because M2 is previous gen chip....


What I'm really worried about is ""FOV""...... Where's FOV info? It's second biggest thing in VR after clarity yet it's missing on AVP"

Resolution/media content is not a big deal, but can it render things in that resolution is the question, and the M2 is not up to that task not even in Pro level devices...... Apple wanted to showoff A17 Pro by showing it can play PC games.... If the M2 was really powerful they would have showed VR games.... There's a reason why they didn't and these are the Reasons:

1. The amount of chips inside this thing is mind-blowing due to the amount of sensors, screens, tracking in it, so it's heat and power limited

2. To avoid heavy weight at the front since it doesn't have battery at the back to counter weight so it have small cooling capacity

3. The M2 like I mentioned here it's not aimed to run at 90C throttling like other M2s, imagine having the heat of Macbook M2 on your face, you think that's acceptable?, it's heavily power and temp limited to avoid that, you can't beat facts, Apple doesn't have some special ability to make ir work as fast without going 90C lol"

Yet people still buy MacBooks."
2024-01-28,"I agree 100% on FOV; it's why I bought the Index at launch in the first place, it was the Next Big Thing for that; and I thought it was highly tangible. My friend who had a Rift of his own, got to experience my new index, poo-poo'd the difference; but i didn't need his defensive input anyway; he didn't want or need to upgrade, and I wasn't trying to sell him one. To ME, the difference was highly tangible.

I'm really hoping foveated rendering comes into better play to correct that shortfall; and that is EXCACTLY why I hope that something like the AVP (or anything else with capacity) finally gets that via software update. Eventually it will. I'm always hoping to live to a moment where the FOV matches my actual POV.

But yes, the M2 isn't that Next Big Thing; I was hoping for at least an M3, if not an ultra. For the price, sure seems like that should have been a logical component. I have Nebula, an Xreal, a 3080 (unfortunately as far as my PC cards go, but with an I9 and 64gb; I need to upgrade my card, but all of my cash is tied up in my AVP!).

It's, in my mind at least, the currently-unknown value of the M2/R1 interface. It's odd to me that more people aren't focused on that! Maybe I'm over-hoping that.

Edit: the library, the content, does concern me. I don't specifically need a Youtube, Spotify, Netflix app; but the lack of apps does worry me. And everyone else."
2024-01-15,"How can this be aimed at professionals? For Sims and engineering/design work, the headset needs to be connected to a PC or a MAC with a high end GPU. The Apple VP is a stand alone headset."

The Apple VR indeed doesn't connect to a PC which is a massive miss for most work where companies want full control of their device, with significant support. 

This Apple VR version will fail because there is no group that actually wants this. Gamers cannot use the second best specs on the market because apple doesn't allow this to connect to a PC. People interested in replacing their TV will hate this as for that you would need a beyond VR or smaller form factor for that to be comfortable. Meetings are betters with a 50 bucks camera.

When you get bigger as an artist you can no longer buy a mac buy would instead work with a render farm to then just render your work on another device instead of your laptop. But you need the windows eco system for that.

It's like saying Tesla drives itself because it's called ""Autopilot"" when in reality it's not, or Tesla saying their cars are Full Self Driving ""FSD"" but they don't.... These are exactly the marketing terms other companies don't use outside of US but these US brands do use because government don't care, both of these brands have hundreds of lawsuit cases against them but in US not a single one worked, outside of US it worked like Europe Cybertruck is banned or Europe lightning port ban.....

Don't use a marketing term as it's a fact, it's not..... The reason Vision Pro is expensive is simple, because it's first Apple VR headset which means massive loss in development budget and time, so they trying to recover that, you not paying into the product but you paying into the development part of it, in reality at consumer level this is at best $1500 product, it's same as XR-3 Varjo and Aero, how the price massively was cut despite offering the same consumer experience overall"

The reason it is far better than the Quest for this is the excellent passthrough, and extremely high resolution. So instead of sitting by your desk with one screen, you can be sitting at your desk but have 5 huge screens, and maybe feel like you're on a beach or a mountaintop whenever you feel like it.

>So instead of sitting by your desk with one screen, you can be sitting at your desk but have 5 huge screens

One heavy, strapped to your face screen. Being realistic, for actual comfort and practicality, someone who works probably isn't going to use that strapped to their face all day, when even reviewers state that after 30 minutes they really feel the weight and take off the headset to reveal red marks on their face.

Infact just several days ago Quest Air Link developers announced the biggest breakthrough in Standalone Quest gaming.... So get ready for that

Vision Pro in no way worth 3500$, like I said you literally paying for the ""development cost"" not actual product price, if Meta used ""development cost"" of Quest 3 then they need to sell it at least 2000$ to cover it"
2024-01-14,"Quest 3 is sold at a loss because Meta makes on average $200 a year from their average Facebook user for building ad products. A Quest user likely brings them way more.

A product is worth what people pay for it, and the people who are going to buy a vision Pro wouldn't even consider a Quest 3 as being an option. It doesn't take 3D photos, it isn't controlled by your eye glances, it doesn't have FaceTime etc. It's a completely different market, and you're just not that market. This is very simple, it's just not for you. Other people will buy it and it will be great for them and their needs."
2024-01-14,"What a load of nonsense lol, it already made 3D videos not only Photos infact some people got iPhone shot video working on Quest 3 as 3D video captured just like what Vision Pro doing..... Facetime? Quest 3 renders an avatar of the person you talking to with not only hand and face tracking but now also body tracking into your home space or virtual environment..... 

Like said you can't really convince someone it's worth 3,500$ hence you say ""not for you"" btw I have Crystal + Big Screen Beyond + Arpara 5K + Quest 3 + Reverb G2 + Pimax 8KX + Varrjo Aero + 3 AR glasses + more.... So don't tell me not for me, I was trying to find a reason that make say ok I want to try Vision Pro but I found non, there's nothing in it that says ok that's new experience.... Clarity? Already achieved, Micro OLED? Already achieved, Hand Eye Body tracking? Already achieved, Workspace apps? Already achieved, passthrough clarity? Already achieved...... There's just non!"
2024-01-14,"Exactly, you're not the market for that headset. It's a wearable laptop, and people who want a wearable laptop and who like Apple products will buy it. Not you."
2024-01-28,"damn, you have me beat, and I thought I was an early adopter/VR headset hoarder! AR glasses; check. Quest lineup: check. Rift, Vive's, Index: check. Still ordered AVP. 14 days to decide. My surprise is that with the list you just listed; you aren't curious about this product launch? I'm no Apple fanboy, just an enthusiast who has been able to introduce many people to a new wonder of technology in a rural area, and updating when there are updates that seem logical. Granted, I have never stepped into the arena of pricing you have mentioned, this will be my first at that level; but that's because that kind of money has been used for PC instead. As a stand-alone experience; I haven't drunk any Cupertino Cool-aid, but my 1tb is coming, and I'm surprised yours isn't."
2024-01-14,"Still he says wearable laptop 🤣, bro did you even bother to see Benchmark leak of that M2? Maybe you should so you stop saying that.... No wonder Apple still finds some guys willing to pay for such a stupidly priced products"
2024-01-28,"I have it ordered with delivery on 12th as I cancelled my 2nd delivery to see VR users reaction of it first, but doesn't mean it's something I think it's worth it, not even close..... Like I mentioned I tried all the high end VR headsets, with Quest 3 we reached diminishing returns line, once you cross Quest 3 you will get about 10-15% better experience for 300-400% the price......

In another comment I already mentioned this headset is for 3 kind of people only:

1. Lifeless VR enthusiasts (like me)
2. Super rich kids who are bored
3. Software developers

I will ask you this like I asked many others and no one could answer it, what exactly (other than eye tracking) does Vision Pro do over Quest 3? What makes it standout against Quest 3 in terms of processing, to me Quest 3 abilities is more impressive than bunch of multitasking apps running that Quest 3 already can do, or facetime or 3D playback which Quest 3 already does..... So what exactly makes Vision Pro M2 processor stand out? So far I had no answer

You paying for this only: display panel, and this Panel is from Sony which already got a successor that's superior last year and Sony is using it now on their headset.....

So how exactly I can say this headset is somehow worth it? Ignoring even it's drawbacks like battery or cable or comfort.....

Oh yeah and the only thing to me standout here is Vision OS"
2024-01-14,"It's never been anything else than a wearable laptop with extra functionality. I'm not in the target group for it either, so no I won't be buying it. I'm just not so thick that I think the whole world revolves around me and my needs."
2024-01-28,"Thanks for the response! I do appreciate the time spent! Your VR pedigree is impressive, to say the least. You hit it on the nose; Quest 3 is the best value in VR that I am aware of. Myself; I'm on multiple PC upgrades, I've hosted VR settings where tech minutia has come into play, like the Vive 2.0 base stations over-riding the 1.0's; to do multiple zones in a large area had us moving the 2.0's around, stapling cardboard shields to cedar posts to keep the 2.0's from screwing up our 1.0 tracking. Most I've managed was three 2.0 base stations in very specific tested locations for Index or Vive Pro 2, two areas with 1.0's on carefully positioned tripods for a couple of vives, and a couple of Quests with their own area-mapping. I don't have to sport EVERYTHING; I actually found a few locals who are also enthusiasts. But that is the point; years now of experiencing a lot of labor, of hit and miss, to make things properly operational. I might as well be rowing a raft on the local river; doing all the work, so others can enjoy (I do that too sometimes).

I'm curious to see (A) what Vision OS brings to the table of this genre, (B) how easy or polished this ends up being (I know this is gen 1, but I've already bought many gen 1 things), (C) the screen experience (I've never tried a Pimax, or a BigScreen, been saving up for this one!). (D) (I keep editing!)...the R1 interface with the M2. I honestly thought they were going to throw an M3 in there, and I'm sure they will on the AVP2; but how much that second chip matters for workflow seems to be a carefully guarded secret. Two chips might turn out to be the game-changer!

I am VERY curious about the Sony (edit: im meant the upcoming Sony headset); and relieved that a guy with your roster would at least be willing to give the new tech a try. Apple-Smapple; i just like to experience new things, and i can't see a 1/2hr demo being a real test. Not for me! I'm pleased not for you. It's worth a shot, for any true enthusiast. I think, anyway"
2024-01-28,"I will say that the Quest 3 passthrough really impressed me. 3 VR-capable PC's in the home, base stations mounted in as many spots as ""doesn't get me newly single"" (chose Bose cubes for the surround sound just to make it all look similar)....and I have followed Oculus/Quest since Palmer was tinkering in his parent's garage. Long before Mark was throwing money at it all! I still have my lineup, haven't sold anything yet; but Quest 3 is where its at.

What does the AVP bring to the table that makes it worth that insane difference? I'll be finding that out with everyone else. Adds the R1, which hasn't been used before. But I THINK; it will have an experience better than anything I've tried. I sent back the Quest Pro, and had an extended period to really run it through its paces; bought it at launch. I didn't think it was worth the cost, and I think I was spot0on; the Quest 3 is the better value. I'll definitely give the AVP every chance to wow. Woof, that cost!"
2024-01-14,"Here I speak facts you have facts bring it? Using claims is just ""claims""..... I can claim Tesla drives itself because it have Autopilot and FSD.... That's just a claim lol....

Let me show you some facts.... Vision Pro battery capacity and power is nearly identical to Quest 3.... Comparing to Quest 3 power consumption to M2 chip of Macbooks, it's about 2X in Air and 3.5X in Pro models.... Now looking at Adreno 740 Benchmarks, it already beaten M2 by twice as much in GFXBench 1080P in FPS/W, the M2 was consuming in Air around 37W..... So considering you already know from battery leak of Vision Pro that it will do half of power consumption..... M2 not even able to beat Quest 3 chip 😂 and you call it wearable laptop? What a joke...

Use your head, facts are available than falling into marketing claims"
2024-01-28,"The 2 things that could impress you are: Vision OS + Display....

For me however the second part I'm not expecting much since I used 5K Micro OLED panels + Crystal + tried VR-4, one thing I learned about clarity is that like I mentioned with Quest 3 we reached diminishing return line, yes it will ""Wow"" you but over time you will be ""meh"" I will rather have the easier experience..... That's what happened with my Crystal + Arpara 5K + Bigscreen Beyond..... Quest 3 is like a headset with a rating 8.5/10 in every single way while others 3-4 times it's price can do one or two areas 9-10/10 while rest 4-5/10....... 

So you really tend to ignore that wow experience for a more user friendly device, as for AVP? I'm expecting it's software will make it user friendly, so you will tend to use it regularly, I personally will use it for media tbh, I'm not expecting anything else to make me excited about it, all I saw is bunch of gimmicks and 2D content so far from AVP....

At least unlike me for you display will impress you for awhile, for me it's all about media experience that the likes of Crystal or Bigscreen Beyond don't provide due to their PCVR nature, Quest 3 does provide just that but missing the OLED part of it, although with updates I noticed better blacks and colors are really impressive but like I mentioned before I'm a ""dumb lifeless VR enthusiast"" so I tend to spend crazy for something dumb lol"
2024-01-14,"Not a single thing you said there matters in any way to people who are going to buy it. And somehow you lack the ability to understand that, no matter how clearly I explain it. Just accept that this is beyond your comprehension already. I'm sure you're great with stats and numbers, but that's not going to help you in the parts you are struggling with here."
2024-01-28,"You definitely have me stone cold on the inevitability that the oled screen and resolution will be immediately seductive! I can't see that not being the case; I haven't experienced anything with a comparable screen like you have. I DO know that most of my VR hoarding has spent a lot of time shelved; I still have an extended mount (painted to match my ceiling fan) under my ceiling fan, for all of the cable-gathering overhead options. I have to get up on a ladder to put all of the cable-retractors, re-run the cable (s: different for the index vs the Quest-hardwire)...

The reality is that those moments are less and less common, because the ease of just throwing on the Quest 3, and handing others the 1 and 2; is easy!

  
I would assume that the AVP will impress on many concepts, some of which I don't have a real comparison for. But (A) super-simple ease, (B) the unknown about the true value of the R1/M2 sharing of load, and (C) what this new operating system bring to the table....I'm honestly excited. OG concept was ""time off from work""' no, i don't have that. I have 12-13 realistic days to spend my free time ignoring my chores, projects, and relationship. I'm going to do that. So Much Money!!!"
2024-01-28,"That latest Quest update was indeed an incredible improvement! That and my Xreals are the only things I actually commonly use anymore. by myself. Till it's time to involve others, and host a larger concept. By THAT comparison metric; the AVP has a decent shot of making me rationalize it. Maybe. I'll see, we'll ALL see. But I did find your arguments with others I've read so far to be informed and specific. If not always kind and complimentary haha. Now that I know you are willing to give it a try, I'll be extremely curious to compare notes"
2024-01-14,"So basically all of this discussion you accepted what I said:

People buy this not because it have something special or does something different or best in the market but because it's called ""APPLE""......"
2024-01-14,"Nope. That's part of it, but it's a lot more complex and multi-faceted. I've already tried telling you the easiest parts, but you didn't even get close to understanding. Partly because you don't want to, but also because you probably aren't able to comprehend nuanced emotional factors related to hardware. Just accept that this is going to be a confusing time for you."
2024-01-14,"LOL what????? 

I literally asked you to provide facts so I get convinced but you delivered 0 facts and now you saying I don't understand?

Imagine believing the term ""wearing a laptop on your head""... Enough said, it's pointless to speak to Apple fans who have 0 knowledge in tech and use Apple marketing claims as facts to support their ideas...."
2024-01-14,"First of all, you have to learn to pay attention. I have clearly indicated multiple times that I am not an apple fan and I do not buy their products. Ok? Is that sinking in yet? 

You are having an episode around not understanding why the Vision Pro is so highly anticipated, and you are trying to feel better about it by convincing yourself these people are just a mindless army of drones who have no agency. That seems to be the only way you can manage to comprehend, and protects you from the chaos of other people thinking differently from you.

Because that's the problem, you're not gonna be understanding any of this with stats and numbers. I'm not trying to convince you, we've already established your mind is incapable of understanding this. I'm just trying to explain it to you so that you can see why you don't understand.

The ""facts"" that are going to convince the buyers are this: It is fun and easy to use, seems cool, is useful for work and leisure (emails and movies), connects to the phone, and works smoothly without requiring any special knowledge.

Nobody except a tiny percentage will give a shit about what processor it has, or the RAM or anything technical. They care if it feels good to use and is useful for them. That's all."
2024-01-14,"Yeah if you dumb enough to not even think about it's specs and putting 3,500$ blindly then that makes you a fanboy....

Bro I won't even read rest of your comments, I provided facts if you have facrs bring it on, saying it's anticipated or loved or blah blah... Doesn't make it worth it, ""a consumer buys the product not the brand"""
2024-01-14,"I didn't think you had such serious reading comprehension issues. Did I say I was going to buy it, or did I say I was not going to buy it? Which was it?

And you can think those people are dumb if it makes you feel better and less scared and confused about the world. It isn't going to help you in the long run though. 

The facts are that these people are just different from you, and prioritize different things from you. It doesn't make you superior to them just because you like your priorities better than theirs. It just makes you different from them."
2024-01-17,"Man, you have a lot of patience! :D"
2024-01-25,holy shit that guy is dumb as rocks
2024-01-28,"I'm honestly curious which one you mean. Both had legitimate arguments to me; a tech enthusiast with an incredible level of frame of reference (if he is sporting some of the headsets he mentioned, he's also rocking a loaded PC with something around a 4090 just to truly experience any decent framerates; and therefore a highly valuable perspective on what top-end VR/AR even looks like)....and a guy who states early that he isn't planning to purchase the AVP (I did); but explaining the theory that the actual user experience might be highly polished, simple, and enjoyable. In short; a version of the tech that doesn't require a layman to understand what a 4090 is, and still have their mind blown by the wonder that is VR/AR today. This isn't the VR of Lawnmower Man, or 1980's science exhibits. Which specific guy were you calling dumb? so cryptic!

Bear with me, I'm new to reddit commentary. If the fact that your post is under Nathan's means you were responding favorably to him specifically then the protocol was lost on me. But if that is the case; NumberWilling4285 certainly doesn't come across as dumb! Highly opinionated, combative, a bit insulting, sure. But if he DOES own the headsets he states he does; there's just a lot to that, to the setup, trouble-shooting, proper operation of those. Tech is a real hassle sometimes! THAT'S why I pre-ordered my AVP; I'd love to see that even more simplified than the Quest 3, which is absolutely my current entry-level recommendation for ANYONE who asks. For now!"
2024-01-29,"In my view NumberWilling4285 very well probably has great insight on VR tech, but every point he makes is the typical ""Apple only sells stuff because of marketing garbage"" that some android/windows/and now a lot of VR users like to say. Its a tired point and every comment he left was essentially repeating that and stating that the tech in the AVP does not justify the $3500. If you watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdKrX-V2p-4, it goes through how incredible and unique the hardware is for VR from someone who is one of the best in the space. IMO its a very typical and stereotypical perspective he holds and comes from a place of thinking you are better or smarter for not buying Apple products. They can miss out on it if they want, but its a dumb way to look at the product"
2024-01-29,That's a fair point. I'm personally really looking forward to trying out the AVP. I follow that youtube channel!
2024-01-14,"Thanks for this update!

I feel we need a similar chart with the display's ""pixels per degree"", because depending on the Fov, you could have a very small Fov and small resolution look exactly the same as a higher Fov and higher resolution..."
2024-01-14,"Man, the  Vision Pro and XR-4 must look amazing. The comparatively small bump from q2 to q3 was dramatic for me. And that was only a 10-15% increase."
2024-01-14,Wow
2024-01-14,gotta be honest here. I think I had the most fun with the bottom two. The DK1 was an age of wonder trying lots of weird demos that made me want to puke. The Vive was the discovery era where you tested the strength of your walls by hitting them with controllers
2024-01-14,VR has come a long way…
2024-01-14,"I really hope there will be some nice native apps for the AVP ready when it’s released. Since it’s not meant for gaming, I’m hoping for something more than regular iPad/iPhone in a headset."
2024-01-14,"Now the only thing we miss is $ per Mpx :) But those numbers look really bad for any high res headset.

Aliso the Apple res is still unconfirmed..."
2024-01-14,valve really needs to step up their game
2024-01-14,"The Bigscreen Beyond is already astounding to my eyes so I can't even fathom what the res jump to the AVP would feel like. Are we getting to diminishing returns at that point or? 
I mean the fov and PPD will factor in too fs."
2024-01-14,No wmr? They are pretty popular on steam
2024-01-14,Thank you lol
2024-01-15,AVP res is actually:  3552x3840.  The micro-oled model #:  Sony ECX344A.
2024-01-14,"It's cool to see how we gave progressed, but I'll be honest, the software is the problem, not the hardware."
2024-01-14,I wish tech media established a standardized short-hand for XR headset resolutions. I've heard both AVP and XR-4 referred to as having 4k per eye displays. Pretty big difference between the actual resolution of the two. Like they gotta stop trying to use TV/monitor resolution terms for these displays. Or stop abbreviating at all.
2024-01-14,Lol where ya hiding my g2
2024-01-14,Nice comparison. I still find it a bit odd though. Seems like comparing laptop displays to computer monitors if that makes sense.
2024-01-14,"Admittedly, I don't know a whole lot about the AVP just yet. For your average VR user / gamer, how functional will this be for them? Apple doesn't have the greatest track record of open compatibility with other tech outside of the Apple ecosystem.

Will this be prohibitively expensive for most VR users? Will this work the majority of programs that most VR users are interested in using?"
2024-01-14,"might be ok to include base stations/controllers in Bigscreen Beyond's price as $999+$577 for valve index controller+2x base stations.

(also for others that don't ship with those)"
2024-01-15,We need to know what the FOV is asap!
2024-01-14,No quest pro?
2024-01-14,I didn't know quest 2 had better resolution than index???
2024-01-14,High price allows for high resolution.  Looking forward to it.
2024-01-14,So…how significant of a visual difference would the AVP be to my Oculus CV1 which I still use occasionally? Never used another headset so I only know what my headset can produce..
2024-01-14,Might be a good idea to update the prices to also include the price of a pc to run the pcvr headsets - xr4 seems like good price to performance vs Vision Pro but this doesn’t include the 3k+ needed for a pc that actually allows it to utilize its full potential
2024-01-14,Still the Quest 2 likely stays at #1 in the price performance chart. Decent resolution for decent price.
2024-01-14,"Lol, I'm still rocking my HTC Vive original. No issues, pretty great super sampled. This graph makes it appear so low res though"
2024-01-14,"Vision Pro has made people that would never think of VR, talk, think, consider VR. It’s great, my business partner will probably get one as a sales/presentation tool and we have never talked about it before.  

Myself I’m hyped for immersed visor. Very exciting year"
2024-01-14,this really puts the varjo xr-4 price into perspective. Seems like a better deal then avp considering you get controllers included
2024-01-14,Damn you beat me to it. Only thing I would add is a graph showing resolutiom / price. Next to this one.
2024-01-14,You can add vive pro 2 with 2448x2448.
2024-01-14,I wonder if it's native resolution or if they're doing any trickery with upscaling to claim that resolution
2024-03-30,"Do we know the actual render resolution of the AVP? If it is the exact same as the display resolution and avp is not supersampling to compensate for barrel distortion, then the displays are not showing an optimal image. If this is the case, the PPD figures mean nothing to the final image. On a PC VR headset you usually need to render about 1.4x the display resolution to fully utilize the display. Some people are saying that text is not very sharp so I suspect a lower render res in the avp. What do you guys think?"
2024-05-21,Visor 4K looks better than apple and costs less than 1/3
2024-01-14,"Still missing the HTC vive pro 2, which is still a good headset."
2024-01-14,I’ve only spent real time in OG Oculus Rift; I’m going to be weeping blood when the AVP gets on my head.
2024-01-14,"I think megapixels would be better than ""millions of pixels"", as people understand megapixels faster."
2024-01-14,Rift S?
2024-01-14,"I wonder why Apple didn’t opt for the same panels as the XR-4

Edit: also I wish these graphics would also show PPD/~FOV because that tells a lot of the story in both experience and visual clarity"
2024-01-14,XR-4 looks great but inside out tracking is an instant nope for me.
2024-01-14,Where is Pico 4?
2024-01-14,"**You're calculating total VR resolution wrong.**

For example, the Bigscreen Beyond has a resolution of 2560x2560 **PER EYE**, so you take 2560x2 (for both eyes) which is 5120 (now we have the horizontal pixel density for both eyes), and **then** you multiply by 2560 (the vertical pixel density) which is 5120x2560 = 13,107,200 pixels.

The same applies to all headsets in the photo, the total pixels displayed has been calculated wrong across all headsets."
2024-01-14,"You are lacking all the WMR headsets, especially the G2."
2024-01-14,Forgot about Pico 4 and it's a pretty bad omission.
2024-01-15,"The Apple Vision Pro at $3,500 with a cable attached to a battery, is a prototype unit intended for Palmer Lucky and maybe a few other CEOs on the Valley.

When Apple brings a real VR/MR product to the market wake me up."
2024-01-14,"For Varjo XR, add subscription fee €1495 / year to be fair."
2024-01-14,would be nice with a Pixel density measure like pixel per degree
2024-01-14,"I can't believe how bad DK1 was, Vive too"
2024-01-14,Still no reverb g2 haha
2024-01-14,"I [graphed this](https://jsfiddle.net/sirisian/n9fzaLxw/9/) recently to see the trends.  It just used Wikipedia's list, so it might not be complete. It's kind of interesting just how far off 16K per eye is at current iteration rates."
2024-01-14,Including the base vive but not vive pro 2 is hilarious
2024-01-15,"Would like to see Quest 1 on the chart, see how it stacks up"
2024-01-15,"FYI, Reverb G2 is 2160 x 2160 per eye. so it's comparable to the Meta Quest 3 here."
2024-01-15,"Wow so varjo is a really good deal based on the infographic.  However, the varjo does not have standalone capability like the Q3.  If having standalone ability is required, then the Q3 is the best deal?"
2024-01-15,Apparently the resolution I need costs a lot.
2024-01-16,"And overpriced, who'da thunk."
2024-01-14,True!
2024-01-14,"The problem is that no matter what metric you use it doesn't tell the whole story with a VR headset. For example, Vive Pro 2 has higher resolution panels than Quest 3, and it would also have higher PPD, but for me perceived clarity of the VP2 is much worse because the lenses have such a small sweet spot and everything outside the middle of the screen is blurry/distorted."
2024-01-14,"PPD has the issue of being misleading, there are two different PPD metrics.

Average PPD and peak PPD, and people mix and match these values.

Average PPD is just pixels / FOV, while peak PPD is based on the lens distortion profile. Most manufacturers do not release peak PPD numbers, so for most devices its not possible to compare this.

But as even FOV is subjective, both of these values end up being more of an estimates."
2024-01-14,I came here to say this.  100%
2024-01-14,Q2 to Q3 was more about the lenses improving a lot in between. These resolution charts have always been wildly misleading.
2024-01-14,It's not really a small bump.  Going from 3.5M to 4.5M pixels is actually a pretty big jump.  Closer to 30% not 10-15%.
2024-01-14,"Can't wait for this resolution to go mainstream next year, this and a 5090"
2024-01-14,The increase in processor power also allowed standalone games to run at a higher resolution.  Games on Quest 2 rarely ran at full resolution.
2024-01-14,"Yeah, it was a big change for me too. It got me to buy a Quest 3 of my own and get back into VR."
2024-01-14,"haven't tested it myself but at some point you'll hit diminishing returns in picture clarity, just like with monitors. Though, maybe that's not a big factor yet at this resolution in VR."
2024-01-15,"Last year I got to test Varjo's headsets and they were amazing. I think they were XR-4 Focal and XR-4 Aero.

The PCs were struggling in some games lol"
2024-01-28,I'm about to jump from an Index to a Crystal... I'm gonna be amazed aren't I?
2024-01-15,"dk1 was entering the matrix, quake has never felt that good since 96 release"
2024-01-14,"It really hasn't, at least not in the mainstream gear. The decade gap between DK2 and Q3 only saw a doubling in resolution and a significant degradation in display technology (OLED to LCD). 

The nearly decade old OG Vive can still reproduce some of the best VR experiences you could show people today, bulletproof roomscale tracking and motion controls, ridiculous contrast and color accuracy, OG Vive was bright AF. Even has an effectively lossless wireless solution available. Pixel density is really the only place it falters, which was/is the easiest metric to solve."
2024-01-14,Apple? Making smart decisions? What is this 2008?
2024-01-14,"I'd say the chart is pretty good as is: focusing on visually showing resolution, and also including information about price. 

If you try to extend visualizations like this in the direction of stuff like pixels per dollar, then it starts to feel a lot like an attempt to show the best overall product. Which would be great if it could be done, but will _always_ leave out a ton of factors. 

What about FOV or PPD? What about miniLED versus microLED versus OLED? What about weight? What about pancake versus fresnel? Standalone support? If not standalone, do you include the cost of an external computer? What about passthrough/AR? What about software ecosystem? What about...

The list of possibly-important things goes on forever. There's no way to cram them all into one graph, so the more you try to make a graph that covers everything, the more it becomes anti-information. 

Much better to have a narrowly targeted graph like this one, which doesn't even imply that it's trying to incorporate the entirety of each device.


> Aliso the Apple res is still unconfirmed...

Eh, mostly not. 23M pixels is from apple's statements, not rumors or guesses. The only thing unconfirmed is the exact aspect ratio, but that wouldn't change this chart."
2024-01-14,"> But those numbers look really bad for any high res headset.

Do they? If you compare the price/megapixel for the vision pro with that of the index, the vision pro would be a better deal."
2024-01-14,"Based on what Apple has released, that res is close enough that it won't be significantly different from actual."
2024-01-14,I so badly wanna make this and many other comparisons. But I'm in my exams period..
2024-01-16,Deckard pleaaaaaase
2024-01-14,"The mainstream VR community has always pretended the G2 doesn’t exist. You would think Quest 3 pixel counts back in 2020 would be a big deal, but I guess not. 

The exception is simmers, the G2 is well known among sim racers, sim pilots, etc. I still remember how amazing it was to actually be able to easily read the dials and gauges in my race car, space ship, or fighter jet for the first time."
2024-01-14,With Windows about to turn WMR into bricks I don't feel like they're that important to include.
2024-01-14,"This. Not only the G2 is one of the most seeked headsets for sims due to resolution, but also in a chart that features a timeline of VR they're ignoring the fact that at release WMR headsets, even gen 1, had a better resolution than anything else at that point. 

People just love to ignore WMR."
2024-01-14,"Dammit I can’t believe they forgot the Virtual Boy!!

Now this chart is literally useless."
2024-01-15,"Whenever a new VR headset is inevitably advertised as ""4k per eye"", I just ignore it and look at the actual resolution. It's practically meaningless."
2024-01-15,"Out of the box there should be no compatibility with existing VR ecosystems whatsoever. Someone in the community will probably hack up a solution, but considering the complete lack of controllers I doubt the experience will be very polished. (You’d either need to cram all controller inputs into hand tracking, or have a frankenstein combination of AVP and Lighthouse-based peripherals)"
2024-01-16,not at all. it's not a vr game device.
2024-01-16,"avp? 110 - 120.

*Hypervision’s Field of View Analysis*  
*Hypervision has also made a detailed field-of-view analysis. They discuss how VR experts who have seen the AVP say they think the AVP FOV is about 110°. Hypervision’s analysis suggests APV’s FOV “wishfully” could be as high as 120°. Either value is probably within the margin of error due to assumptions. Below is a set of diagrams from Hypervisions analysis.*"
2024-01-14,It’s the same as quest 2
2024-01-14,"The games are internally rendered at a lower resolution so they don’t look amazing, but hook it up to a capable pc and it makes a world of difference"
2024-01-14,"The CV1 has the same resolution as the HTC Vive to put the difference in resolution into perspective. Things like the improved optics and better colors, etc. will make even more of a visual impact. The difference is gonna be huge"
2024-01-16,Even the quest 3 would be worlds apart.
2024-01-15,"Fucking massive

Imagine that your CV1 looked like a 1080p display...

Well, that's almost the G2, and it's ""only"" 2160p when the CV1 is 1200p...

Now imagine how it could look with a massive 3400p :)"
2024-01-16,"Well, AVP doesn’t come with vr controllers and wont do pcvr at all so that aspect is completely irrelevant. There is no news on standalone gaming either."
2024-01-14,"If you want to get into VR and don't have a gaming PC already, you're probably unaware of most of the headsets here or her than quests. So it's not like the PCVR head sets would be concidered anyways"

2024-01-15,"It's between the vive and index. I know that Facebook stopped giving a shit about it months after release, but it's still one of the top HMDs used on steam"
2024-01-14,The quest 2 will be quickly dethroned when meta releases the quest 3 lite at some point this year.
2024-01-15,"Recently I played again with my Vive, and surprisingly enough, with supersampling it looks very close to a Vive pro.

Like, you have SDE yes, and also less definition, but it looks very good, 0 issues, really."
2024-01-14,"Yeah, I used the OG vive for years, but got kinda tired of needing to be so close to read stuff. Cheap used index HMD is an amazing upgrade."
2024-01-14,Yeah you do get used to the vive screens. Also index looks way better than the res would have you believe. But really once you go Q3 you won’t go back.
2024-01-15,"When you do end up upgrading, you will get the unique pleasure of jumping ahead several tech generations. Definitely something to look forward to!"
2024-01-16,"Except for the fact that it's not VR. Apple wants it to have nothing to do with VR, and be *Spatial Computing* instead (mostly AR)."
2024-01-15,"I’d argue the lack on controllers on Vision Pro is a good thing, at least that’s what I’d prefer for ease of use especially of the tracking is as flawless as people say"
2024-01-14,Resolution/price gonna be launch price of these headsets or what you can for them now.
2024-01-14,"Yeah i could've probably fit that in there. An oversight on my part, my bad."
2024-01-14,"That's the first thing I looked for. I think you got downvoted because the per-eye resolution is 2448x2448.

I know enthusiasts aren't a huge fan of the VP2 (some god rays, small sweet spot), but it's my first and only headset and the resolution clarity is pretty great."
2024-01-14,"I believe the XR-4 is mini LED, while the Vision Pro is micro-OLED."
2024-01-14,"This was only intended for resolution but the PPD and FOV are far more important factors when choosing a headset, i agree"
2024-01-16,FOV is about the same for most of em. AVP is about 110 - 120 deg.
2024-01-14,"The Varjo XR-4 has support for lighthouse base stations. Anyone who is dropping 4K on those, for a home setup is probably going to want to pick up a set of base stations for outside tracking."
2024-01-15,Very similar to Quest 3.
2024-01-14,"But your brain can't see both of them at once. They aren't side by side.

Pixels per eye makes way more sense because that's what you see.

It's not like there's a headset where one eye has more/fewer pixels than the other.

Not sure why you made that convoluted calculation when you could've just commented ""it's 2x when accounting for both eyes""."
2024-01-14,"I must have missed something, where does he claim that this is for both eyes?  It looks like a fair comparison of the headset panels to me."
2024-01-14,"This is to counter that other topic, where Apple looks way behind everyone. As people complained it was misleading"
2024-01-14,"Didn't forget, just ommitted it due to the resolution being too similar to the Quest 3's to present it properly in this image"
2024-01-14,Yeh maybe cause it would make the quest look bad haha
2024-01-14,afaik the Varjo XR-4 does not require a subscription to use like the XR-3 did
2024-01-16,Are you the same guy who did the other one? Can we get a box chart of price with the resolution as the footnote?
2024-01-16,"Yeah, I stick the quest three directly on my face with no face interface. This is why the quest is the best."
2024-01-14,"To compound this the Quest 2 was a single, fixed panel design so you weren't actually getting as much out of the panel as you could compared to using two screens which move with the lenses, like the Quest 3 has. So in practice the bump is higher than the resolution would imply because its being used a lot more efficiently as well."
2024-01-14,Yeah thats why i put the disclaimer at the top
2024-01-14,"It's also about the Qualcomm XR Gen 2 chip, The Quest 2 doesn't even use its full resolution for the majority of their games!  Quest 3 and the Quest Game Optimizer finally let you use the full resolution on a bunch of Quest games, making old Quest games look amazing!  

The jump from Quest 2 is more like ~1440 x 1584 to ~2064 x 2208 when you look at Rendered resolution on a bunch of games."
2024-01-14,"That's where you can make a real gain with current hardware. We need better GPUs to drive high-resolution panels.

The AVP has high resolution panels for the passthrough video. Its GPU can't drive that many pixels in a game."
2024-01-14,"Not really misleading, as there is no clear way to define lens quality. We dont have MTF numbers on any of these lenses.

Resolution in megapixels is still the clearest way to compare headsets.

PPD is still extremely misleading, as people compare average and peak PPD numbers. Much like Pico4 & Quest3 comparison. Where Pico4 gives average PPD and Quest3 gives peak PPD. And then people compare these directly."
2024-01-14,"Coming from having tried several 1600-1700 headsets, I was amazed by the resolution of the Q3 at the beginning. But it didn't long until I started becoming aware of the screendoor and the limitations. It's fine though, its absolutely acceptable, although I want to go a step up for my next headset, maybe minimum 2.5-3K if I extrapolate how I feel right now."
2024-01-14,"Quest3 cant run at full resolution in standalone, it renders at 1680x1760. So at 3Mp.

So there is a quite significant upscaling in all of the standalone content.

Quest2 standalone render resolution is 1440 x 1584. So 2.2Mp."
2024-01-14,"The low cost headsets are light years away from a diminishing returns plateau, the VP and XR4 are unknowns as basically no one has used them, and certainly no one outside of research labs have used anything higher to compare against."
2024-01-15,"We're still a long way from that point - even at Vision Pro and Varjo resolutions.

Maybe a better way to say would be that we're probably starting to approach the point of diminishing returns, but still a long way off from the point where further improvements aren't even noticed."
2024-01-14,"I used to have a Vive and the screendoor effect, lenses and glare was too much of deal breaker. My Quest 3 is waaaay better and for half the price. It can do all the Vive did without having to install all that hardware all over a room. Wtf r u talking about?"

2024-01-15,"Exactly correct. 

VR is one of those ""more than the sum of its parts"" things. You could have a terrible experience despite incredible specs, or an amazing experience despite terrible specs.

2024-01-14,The G2's resolution is very similar to the Quest 3's so i wasn't able to include it in a satisfying way which is why i left it out
2024-01-14,"The issue was the WMR platform, it _sucked_. The OS tie-in and room setup process were especially awful."
2024-01-14,Are we sure they're turning them into bricks? Or just that it won't work with new iterations of windows? I can't imagine they would update windows 10 and 11 to remove WMR
2024-01-14,Considering WMR is your only option for OLED without base stations I think they would be good to include
2024-01-14,Well the Rift DK1 is not precisely a current headset either. If they're aiming to make a historical comparison of the evolution of VR headsets it would be fair. But whatever hack that made this chart seemingly doesn't know about the Pico 4's existence either. How convenient to just be a Facebook and Apple shill.
2024-01-15,"Exactly, when I got my Lenovo explorer, LCD RGB subpixels at 1440x1440 per eye was sharper than any other competing headsets. Plus it was half the price of its cheapest competitor. Wmr was, and still is, amazing value for money. They are excellent headsets."
2024-01-15,"I'm not sure you can equate the virtual boy from 30 years ago to current headsets. Although from a resolution standpoint it would be interesting/ funny to see it there, assuming it's visible on the chart that is"

2024-01-14,Yeah i was running out of space so i didn't include some headsets that had similar or the same resolution

2024-01-14,"Still for anyone wanting to get into vr that doesn’t have a pc already the comparison isn’t accurate. Sure a pc isn’t only for vr but it’s not like I.e. the big screen beyond is 40% more expensive than the q3 since that’s just the headset excluding controllers, lighthouses and a pc capable to run it - that’s like doing price/fps comparisons between different pc hardware but one setup doesn’t even include a case while the other one comes with monitor, peripherals and a desk"
2024-01-14,"What will the Lite have? I don't think it will dethrone it unless it delivers more resolution for the same price. The Q3 is just too expensive right now, significantly over what the Q2 was even at launch."
2024-01-14,"As someone who upgraded from the OG Vive to the Q3... yeah the difference is pretty huge. That being said, the vive still has some advantages over the Q3 even though is so old."
2024-01-14,How's the Vive OLED vs the Q3 color?
2024-01-15,"I ""downgraded"" from a G2 to a Vive, and it only took like 2 days to get used to it XD

It's surprising, tbh"

2024-01-16,"For media yeah. For games, forget games."

2024-01-14,It has? Now it's becoming even more interesting.
2024-01-14,Never let a little thing like facts get in the way of redditors hallucinating a point so they can call others wronger than them.
2024-01-14,"Exactly, it implies the total pixel count is for the headset because they do not specify the calculation is for **just one display**. The Bigscreen Beyond doesn't carry 6.5 million pixels, it carries 13 million pixels as a whole headset package. Either way, it's a bad comparison with information that's not clear."

2024-01-14,"Is that why the pupillary distance adjustment on the quest 2 is in steps and the one on the quest 3 is continuous? Never did make much sense to me why it wasn't continuous from the start, or at least a ratcheting design with much smaller steps (which would help keep it in place after you'd dialed it in)."
2024-01-24,The Quest 3's panel orientation plays into this too.
2024-01-14,"Yeah, and the AVP and XR-4 won't be using the full resolution either. Best case is heavy foveated rendering, but they both have eye tracking, so hopefully it'll go a long way.

It's not feasible, even on desktop, to run full 28mp/90hz, except in the most basic views. Like we are just at the point that 4k(8m)/60hz is a target on PC. Apple silicon is good, but not THAT good."
2024-01-14,Who would not use it for SteamVR? Of course the integrated CPU is utter shit. But then you could argue the same for any other headset. And most don't even have their own CPU.
2024-01-14,Does the Quest optimiser work for Quest 2 aswell?

perhaps, but eye tracking and dynamic foveated rendering helps a ton, even if simply tacked on afterwards instead of properly done in-engine. Fixed foveated rendering helps too, of course, but it's an ugly hack compared to the real thing"
2024-01-14,"Not really, we need eye tracking and real Quad Views DFR support built into the games.

There is no issues in running high resolution headsets, if the games support Quad Views DFR."
2024-01-14,">Resolution in megapixels is still the clearest way to compare headsets.

Compare the headsets how?

* You don't know the actual render resolution.
* You don't know what % of the panel resolution is utilized.
* You don't know the sub-pixel count which directly affects sharpness and yet doesn't affect the resolution.
* You don't know the FoV.
* ...

I believe we are closing in the very definition of misleading. There's simply no point for these charts, other than some pesky rivalry of stats measuring that is."
2024-01-14,"PPD is more accurate than megapixels, megapixels doesn't take FoV, single or double displays, nor lens/display cant into account.

Afaik on most headsets the peak and average PPD is usually still pretty close, it's just more-so on the Quest 3/Pro because Meta is doing something with the lenses to focus it in the middle. Every manufacturer (afaik) also gives the peak PPD on the specs sheet, that 20.6 number for the Pico 4 likely is it's peak PPD since it makes no sense for them to advertise the lower number."
2024-01-14,Ah ok.  I'm no expert so didn't know.  But having tried both the Q2 and Q3 it definitely felt like more than a 10-15% increase in detail.
2024-01-14,"Megapixels just make more sense. Anything else is misleading, like ""linear resolution"" is extremely misleading. Its more of a marketing term.

4k resolution does not really tell that much, that's why VR displays are described as 4k \* 4k for example. But at that point, just use megapixels."
2024-01-14,">it renders at 1680x1760.

This is not true, different games run at different resolutions. AW2 for example runs at 2163 x 2288."
2024-01-14,"That seems like a more significant resolution increase than the screen resolution.  Foviated Rendering also plays a part in making resolutions appear higher, at the expense of edge to edge clarity."
2024-01-15,"fair. I would really like to be able to test them all out to see how big the difference feels to me, though the comparison wouldn't be perfect due to difference in lenses."
2024-01-14,"I'm on the same page. I can barely stand to go back to a Vive Pro, let alone an original Vive. Easily noticeable screen door effect and low resolution, glare and god rays are just unacceptable to me now. 

In fact, going back and looking at these older headsets makes me understand why VR wasn't a big hit right off the bat. Some of us enthusiasts could *overlook* the shortcomings and still get immersed, but they very much were there."
2024-01-14,"Fair, I appreciate the response."
2024-01-14,"It did not suck, they were great headsets that pioneed the inside out tracking. Had affordable prices, and wide availability.

The price & inside out tracking was what made them awesome and way ahead of their time.

Not to mention how G2 pushed the resolution, as it was released the same year as Index that had no inside out tracking and only 2.3Mp resolution.

Samsung Odysseys was released 2017,  had OLED panels and 2.3MP resolution & inside out tracking and integrated audio. All this, 2 years before Index."
2024-01-14,"Eh, the WMR app wasn’t great, but I’m not sure it was really a problem—certainly Steam VR seems to use more system resources and be less stable than the WMR app.  OpenXR seems to play much nicer with the WMR app.  I also don’t find the room setup onerous, though it is funny that (I think) it was identical from like 2017 to now.  Like no obvious improvements there whatsoever over six years of development.

The real problem with WMR was always the controllers, specifically controller tracking. Even when meta went to inside-out tracking their controller tracking was pretty much always better than WMR’s. I haven’t done a real side-to-side comparison like a real reviewer, but I don’t think even the final G2 V2 controller tracking was ever as good as the Q2 controller tracking based on playing with other people’s Q2s over the years

Of course it’s hard to compare, because WMR was improving tracking over time and Meta is famous for making huge improvements over time through software updates, but I still think WMR never got to Q2 levels of controller tracking reliability and fidelity, and of course both are blown out of the water by the Index’s controllers. 

It makes sense that us simmers picked the G2 since we are usually using other peripherals rather than the included controllers anyway. I certainly would not have picked a G2 if I was like a devoted Beat Saber player!"
2024-01-15,"Yes but not really.

Besides the room setup, you don't need to do anything with WMR, because you could just boot SteamVR and that's it.

The only real issue was the tracking quality."
2024-01-14,I've got a webcam and 8x8 MIDI interface from over 20 years ago which work perfectly. I doubt it's going to be insta-gone moment

2024-01-15,The second
2024-01-15,My point is that they won't be any option for anything when Windows kills them off as is planned.

2024-01-15,"I remember buying the Quest 2, thinking that it would look sharper than the Lenovo Explorer, but somehow it ended up being worse...

On one hand, in standalone it doesn't even run at half the native resolution (maybe 1400p when it should be 2700p), and on PC, it ran with lower performance AND compression, it was noticeably blurrier."

2024-01-16,"The AVP is pointless if gaming is a reason you buy these headsets. There is almost zero support for gaming, no 6dof controllers, can't play any currently out game for either standalone quest or pcvr (because the main interface is eye tracking)

At best you'd just be able to play some apple made arcade mobile AR games.

It's almost like buying a mac to play games."
2024-01-14,"It's reportedly pretty much the same as the quest but has the same chip as the quest 3.

So essentially it's a $299 quest 2 with a much more powerful ship, delivering the same performance as the quest 3 in standalone games (and better pcvr streaming as well) so if you had the quest 2 and the quest 3 lite at the same price then it would be really stupid to get an quest 2 instead."
2024-01-14,Blacks way better on the vive of course. Color not much different probably move vibrant on vive but on the quest you don’t need to contend with screen door (that much)
2024-01-14,">Varjo XR-4

On the Varjo site they mention the base stations in the system requirements section. They recommend 4 x 2.0 base stations. Anyone buying that headset has probably got the $450-$600 needed to buy the base stations.

2024-01-14,"It explicitly says ""per eye"" in literally every single box. It does not imply ""total"" at all. Also, it doesn't matter because the relative difference is the same.

The only point at which ""total"" pixel count matters is when you're comparing vs a flat monitor in terms of rendering effort, and even then just pixel-counting an HMD display is misleading because VR is basically never rendered at exactly the HMD's pixel count."

2024-01-15,"Re: ""even on desktop"", CS2 will run at 400FPS on a 4090 at 1440p, so that's around 1500FPS per million pixels, which is crudely not far off 60fps @ XR-4 resolution, and that's before foveated rendering. The limitation is possibly displayport bandwidth. High end PC VR is capable of driving these resolutions with suitably optimised games."

2024-01-14,"Its still the only metric that make sense, others are even more relative.

FOV is always relative, so basically its impossible to know accurately. But its also quite often told along with the resolution. Usually you need to know the resolution & FOV.

For this you could use average PPD, but the issue is that then people mix it up with peak PPD. So just giving resolution in MP and FOV makes the most sense.

Render resolution is usually known and only few devices use upscaling anymore. Older Pimax headsets, and Bigscreen in 90hz mode.

Subpixel count is totally irrelevant. Are there any other arrangement than RGB? Meaning 3 sub pixels per one pixel?

And based on that chart, you can actually quite easily compare devices. They do rank up pretty much exactly based on resolution. There are no better alternatives, that would be as clear and easy to understand as megapixels."

They prioritized resolution so much, they didn't consider what you can run at that resolution. It's the same with my m1 pro mac, it's got a great resolution, and works great for 2d/video etc. But as soon as I load BG3 and try and run native res, it drops to 20fps and my 8 hour battery becomes 1 hour tops.

But don't get me wrong, foveated rendering is great, and theoretically eye tracking + foveated rendering can go a very long way, and at least the hotspot where you are looking can be native resolution, hopefully."

2024-01-14,">Subpixel count is totally irrelevant. Are there any other arrangement than RGB? Meaning 3 sub pixels per one pixel?

Yes there are, it has been one of the biggest display related debates in VR. Most OLED HMDs we have are using pentile panels, which only have two subpixels per pixel. That's a massive drop in real-life information despite having the same resolution.

Not only do you render less detail, you still waste the same performance. Also the diagonal placement makes for example reading more difficult. It's still to be seen what approach AVP takes.

&#x200B;

>FOV is always relative, so basically its impossible to know accurately.

No it ain't. It isn't measured by eye, there are cameras and testers for that purpose.

Pancake lenses + HDR + microLED + very high resolution + entire FOV would be basically perfect. 

Only other thing that I could think of that would be nice to improve for display/lens tech would be to deal with accomodation-vergence coupling, though that seems still quite far off based on the prototypes they made at meta.

The power consumption on this device would be really high though, and the onboard video decoder would have to be very beefy if it's intended for wireless PCVR. Maybe It'd be handy to wear a battery backpack :D"

Yeah, for standalone XR the high resolution is required to render readable text on floating windows (I've tried Virtual Desktop on my Pico 4 and it's unusable for work, needs more resolution and clarity), it's not going to be used to run full FOV AAA games at native res.

2024-01-14,"Yeah, but that article is nonsense advertisement from META.

PPD simply is not a good value, as like i mentioned you end up mixing and matching average & peak PPD. We dont know peak PPD for most devices.

Iw seen people compare Pico4 & Quest3 PPD numbers, but both give a different PPD number. Pico4 lists average PPD, and Quest lists peak PPD.

And do you know any of the MTF values for these lenses? MTF is completely pointless for VR.

No you don't, the only value you know for certain is the panel resolution. And like i said, those headset do rank up exactly like that. Based on the resolution. Panel resolution is still the most important thing.

Basically, for overall resolution the best way to test is to use eye test charts in VR.

""No it ain't. It isn't measured by eye, there are cameras and testers for that purpose."" And this depends on the person (their IPD, eye socket depth etc), this is why we have different FOV numbers from different people."

But they don't. Have you actually tried these HMDs? I moved from Aero to Q3 and the perceived image quality/sharpness of Q3 is better in comparison.

As an Index and Q2 owner too I'd say the large gap between the two is also misleading (Q2 is a single LCD panel and as such there's plenty of pixels cut off).

What you can use the resolution for (in combination of refresh rate) is to estimate how difficult the HMDs are to drive. But even then there are some variables like foveated rendering of Quest Pro, ATW/ASW techniques of Meta-devices and so on.

But you should not use resolution to rank how sharp the perceived visuals will be.

>Basically, for overall resolution the best way to test is to use eye test charts in VR.

Well now you are getting a bit forward. Using visual data through lens at least gives you combined results of different technological compromises -- similar to what Meta suggests."

Panel resolution simply matters the most still, so thats why using megapixels simply makes sense. So far you have not shown anything as fast & easy to understand. All you are trying to say that its more complicated, of course it is thats obvious.

But people read reviews to get subjective takes, you cant fit a review into a chart or a list. This is the thing, you need something simple and easy to understand. And thats megapixels.

The two values people are mostly interested, is horizontal FOV & resolution in megapixels.

This could be combined into average PPD. But most people dont understand the difference of peak & average PPD, so it ends up being confusing."
2024-01-14,"That uses a [Samsung AMOLED](https://www.anandtech.com/show/12676/the-huawei-p20-p20-pro-review/5) panel with a pentile layout (the non-Pro P20 uses an LG panel with an RGBW layout). You just don't notice it on modern phone displays because it's so absurdly high resolution.

I was actually slightly wrong when I claimed that no OLEDs use RGB -- Samsung's tablet-sized displays do use RGB, but virtually all phones, monitors, and TVs (and portable OLED gaming devices like the Switch and Steam Deck) all use non-RGB-stripe layouts, whether that's pentile, diamond, or WRGB.

Edit: I see what you're getting at, and some of those do have 1:1 quantities of subpixels and pixels, but not all of them do, and even the ones that do may not map cleanly from logical pixels to subpixels."
2024-01-14,"Quest 3 is like having your eyes fixed after Aero as the edge-to-edge clarity is so much better among other visual improvements. You do have a new artifact, compression, but that seems to rise its head only in specific, usually dark scenarios and PCVR-only.

>So far you have not shown anything as fast & easy to understand

I'm afraid you are really missing the point. Consider this example: you have HMDs A and B. B has 1px more resolution, but A comes with RGB-stripe sub-pixel arrangement and pancakes lenses where-as B is PenTile and old fresnels.

These two have effectively a 33% difference in sharpness simply by having a different display panels. Then they have a massive difference on top of that based on lens quality/characteristics.

I assume you pick the Better one, i.e. the one with 1px more? You got **misled**.

\---

I'm not trying to give you something fast to understand, when my whole point has been that this is more about combination of different aspects than some one number you can throw around. If you want to be misled, fine, but it's still misleading.

If you really need to compare something fast and dirty, use images, use videos, use reviewers. While they may also have issues, at least you won't get totally bamboozled."
2024-01-14,"I did look at it with a magnifier to check that it had RGB pixels, pentile layout is still RGB. all of those layouts use RGB subpixels, no matter what the arrangement is. Expect the RGBW.

2024-01-14,"Well now you go into your subjective opinions.

You just dont seem to get it, you have no alternative to megapixels. Thus we use megapixels.

I have at no point claimed its some sort of all-inclusive magic rating, we live in the real world. Real world is complex; thus we simplify it because we want to compare stuff fast.

If you cant offer anything else, then i dont get why you are ranting some obvious stuff here? everyone knows there are other differences. That is not the point. The point is that you cant add all that into a chart or a list.

And these 1px speculative examples are just childish. 1px would not show up in a megapixel rating. As we use 1 decimal. So you need at least 100k more pixels to even register. And even then we know, that 0.1megapixels is not a significant difference that you would expect seeing.

Thats the magic of megapixels you just proved. Easy to compare, fast to understand. Its called practical, it reduces information into the most essential for easy and fast absorbion."
2024-01-14,"[The PenTile](https://phandroid.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/PENTILEBLAH-550x351.png) layout in VR has meant that two devices both with 2k x 2k resolution, [can have a very different visual performance](https://imgur.com/9owNUKH).

Historically all (regular) OLED HMDs have been PenTile except the original PSVR. Afaik mOLED releases have been RGB-stripe.

While PenTile has meant less detailed visuals, it has also meant diagonal appearing sub-pixel arrangement which is problematic with UIs that often consist of straight horizontal and vertical lines. PenTile breaks these lines and introduces aliasing. This also makes text more difficult to read, which is a relatively big deal.

Things however have gotten a bit more complex now as Meta has started to tilt their LCD-panels diagonally (to increase vFoV), which means that at times even LCD-HMDs can suffer of that aliasing.

That's essentially the gist between the two arrangements."
2024-01-14,"Yeah, we're talking about different things. You're talking about whether the elements of color are R, G, and B (which they are, except in WRGB displays), I'm talking about the layout of those elements and whether they correspond 1:1 with logical pixels, which they do not necessarily. As an example, from the article I linked:

> The particularity on the smaller P20 is the RGBW subpixel layout. In theory this allows better light transmissivity as the white subpixels lets through more of the backlight light. The problem here is that it’s **not a 4 subpixel per logical pixel layout but rather a custom layout with mixed subpixel configurations**. Together with the lower 1080p resolution this results in a noticeably lower effective resolution and sharpness than you would expect from a traditional 1080p screen, and the end result is a lot closer to the sharpness of an OLED’s diamond pentile layout.

(emphasis mine)

This is presumably also the kind of thing /u/Raunhofer was talking about."
