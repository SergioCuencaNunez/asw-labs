2023-03-31,"UPDATE 
Single Use Is Here! ---> https://youtu.be/sruYSfQV7dA"
2023-03-31,"The QC Earbuds II have mind-blowingly good ANC. Their ANC is not only the best in the earbuds world, but it is even better than any over ear headphones to this date. I tested them against the Bose QC45 and Sony XM4. With these state-of-the-are over ear headphones I was still able to hear a very very slight rumbling coming from the compressor of the fridge, which is already very impressive. But that noise was gone with the QC earbuds II. Same goes with noise types like chatting people etc. The QC Earbuds II kicks everything out of the water."
2023-03-31,"Sounds like they hit all of the major things that I like and need most: good sound, excellent noise cancellation, great phone call quality, great fit, splash resistant and total controls.  I have always liked Bose.  They just work."
2023-03-31,I seriously appreciate the way you displayed the headphones fit and functionality. Other reviewers don't do this often enough. Good work!
2023-03-31,"I don't think they deserve to be called a ""Huge"" disappointment. Smaller case, more charges, less bulky earbuds, more fitting combinations, improved touch controls, improved ANC, same amazing sound quality.  There's a whole lot of good here."
2023-03-31,Bose has confirmed the single bud mode will be available in a future firmware update
2024-03-30,"These are an improvement over the 1st gen buds. https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxK5mc3yw4xA7Mf2j6k6n1Uqv_KUgrKdeM Pros: The fit is fantastic. This is the biggest plus. They stay in my ears when running and become unnoticeable. They are tight but comfortable. The sound quality is about the same as the 1st gen buds. They pair more easily with my LG G8 ThinQ and immediately reconnect when removed from the case. The sound balance is excellent, good but not overpowering base and clean mid tones and highs.Cons: The noise cancellation is good but perhaps a little less effective than the Bose ANC on the 1st gen buds. Passthrough mode as not as good as the 1st gen buds making it a little more difficult to hear conversations when in passthrough."
2023-03-31,"@ this price point people want wireless earbuds with bed and breakfast. Each product is designed for an specific goal, and for Bose is quiet and comfort. Can’t deny they do this pretty well."
2023-03-31,"The Bose QC 2 hit on all the main points for me. They're hands down the best ANC for wireless buds to date (Might be better than my Sony XM5 at ANC and those are over ear! No ). The ANC reduces noise so well you don't have to listen to music higher than 50% volume, saving your ears from any future hearing damage. These are fantastic buds for working out. Bose QC2  stay in your ear even with a sweaty workout. Bose did a wonderful job balancing the sound and there's an adjustable EQ for high, mids and lows or 4 presets you can choose from as well. The bass is thumpy asf and it's not too much where it drowns the mids. Touch control is very reliable. Bose created a nice curvature at the top of the headphone that makes for more accuracy for touch controls because it can better sense the tip of your finger. Transparency mode is almost as good as the new Airpods Pro 2. You can create your own transparency mode which is pretty cool. This review fails to mention independent use will be corrected with a firmware update soon but guessing at the time of the review it was not known to the reviewer. Wireless charging is a feature it should've included but I'm not one to use it often. The same goes for multipoint. If you're someone who cares about the meat and potatoes such as ANC,  sound quality, comfort, and  voice call performance you're gonna have a hard time finding any headphones (over ear included) that do it as well as the Bose Quietcomfort 2. ""Huge Disappointment"" is a misleading title for a fantastic product because it doesn't have wireless charging or multipoint (airpods 2 pro don't and many either). BUT THAT'S THE TREND, NEED THE CLICK BAIT."
2023-03-31,Loving these buds. Things like independent usage and wireless charging complaints is pretty lame.  I bought these for sound and ANC.   Not wireless charging
2023-03-31,"You gave the perfect review my man. Your the only person being honest about the most important 
things about the new release. Thank you once again. I have the 1st  gen, and all the points you covered where the questions I had before purchasing."
2023-03-31,"I totally agree with you, the most frustrating thing to me is not being able to use a single earpiece"
2023-03-31,"Appreciate the review - helped a lot in deciding to get the QCEIIs despite having purchased the previous version a couple of years ago.  Interesting to read the various comments posted - I've had a whole series of Bose head- and ear-phones over the years, in a job that involved a lot of planes, trains and automobiles (and occasionally Offshore oil & gas installations, steel foundries and the odd coal mine), so I was surprised to find a product review that was headed ""Huge Disappointment"".  I guess the real issue is that what all of us are looking for is a smaller, lighter pair of earbuds, ideally with on-board batteries that's last a day or so, and with a case that will provide an additional weeks worth of charge (wireless charging, of course), best in class ANC, touch controls for every possible function, waterproof, immune to gale-force winds, wireless charging and CODECs that will deliver high definition audio - and of course they need to stay put in my ears).  
Reality is that until these arrive there is always going to be a degree of compromise.  For me the priority is good audio quality, best possible ANC and adequate battery life.  If I'm planning to listed to listen to (and appreciate) Hi-def audio it's not  going to be on a train via a noise-cancelling device over bluetooth (I use a pair of wired 1More Quad Drivers).  Happy to lose the wireless charging for a much smaller charging case and better case battery life, and (maybe it's just me/my ears) but Bose earbuds are the only brand I've found that are comfortable and secure, thanks in the past to their ""wing-tip"" design (when I got my wired 1More Quad Drivers I was also hugely disappointed because the audio was fantastic, but they wouldn't stay in.  I was going to return them, but then found that my Bose wing-tips fit the 1More buds perfectly!"
2023-03-31,I didn't expect bose to fix mono mode or multipoint tbh... but taking away wireless charging made my jaw drop.
2024-03-30,"To me, Bose is #1 for sound quality (and noise cancelling). That's where it stands. If you need other features, and if those other features are more or as important as the sound quality, go with other brands. I always choose Bose because sound quality is my main choice when it comes to choosing a headphone (including in-ear)"
2023-03-31,"So I guess I can say I'm the first person that's used these solely in a shooting range with no real ""ears"" on or hearing ear muffs for the non shooting community I'll say they did a decent job for a 9mm in the range, outside ranges may be good enough for a centerfire rifle but I couldn't imagine using these for inside rifle fire. Overall these little super comfortable things are impressive.. I see this incorporated into the military while sound canceling and batt life gets better over the years"
2023-03-31,"Excellent review. I like what they have done with the size of the buds and the case. While it is disappointing they took away wireless charging, I have only done it once on my AirPods Pro.  So I could live with that.  Call quality is more important for me and that's where it sounds like they struggle a bit. But I will bet that they sound better than the new APP (second gen)."
2023-03-31,"Great review! I’m a longtime user of multiple Bose products, and I’m trying to hang in there with them because they have the best ANC (in my opinion, especially in the earbud market), but I too am disappointed with the fact that they seem to be moving backwards when it comes to technological advancements. 

Their QC30s, which I still have and occasionally use, were among the first earbuds (if not the first) to have adjustable noise canceling and multipoint connection capability. Likewise, it truly puzzles me, that they haven’t included that feature (on their earbuds) since the QC30s.

That said, I really like the ANC my Quiet Comforts provide so I preordered the Quiet Comfort II, “on the strength,” knowing they were missing the aforementioned features; although I’m having second thoughts about doing so."
2023-03-31,"I agree with him. Your paying all this money and their only improving some aspect from the original. I was going to buy them, I think I'll stick to my LG's. If I need that much ANC I'll use my Sony XM4s. As much as I want to buy them, Bose's needs to move forward, not backwards."
2023-03-31,"I agree with most of your complaints.  But I must say that when wearing earbuds I’m either talking on the phone or listening to music. I don’t want, or do I care to listening music in a mono mode!!!!  I’m a musician and music and sound is very important. Other than that I agree with your other complaints"
2023-03-31,"Thank you for the review. I am disappointed the case can't be charged wireless too. The customer rep told me the single earbud option will be available in the firmware update before the end of this year. Also, the good news is the chipset is the latest Qualcomm 5 chipset, so the options for upgrades and improvements are there for sure. Nonetheless, because of the case, I might be purchasing the Sennheiser Momentum TW 3."
2023-03-31,"I have these, and I'm able to use single usage mode, no problem. 

If you have the auto play/pause feature on, when you pull one of them out, it'll pause. Just unpause by touching the one still in your ear, and it continues to play. 
If you have the auto play/pause feature off, then you won't have to do anything when you pull one out. Simply, place the removed one back in the case as the music continues to play in the one still your ear. 
The left one is in my ear playing music and the right one is in the case, lid closed - as I'm typing this comment."
2023-03-31,"On “single usage mode”…after owning many different ear buds I can honestly saying I’ve never found myself thinking that I’d only want to use one side. Don’t modes like ambient or aware provide for most of the use cases? I get your point on wireless charging, though that becomes less of an issue for devices that have long battery life AND are not near their home base much of the time."
2023-03-31,"With my first set, the left bud stopped working within 5 days (last week).  Got them replace, but have not had a chance to use the new set yet.  The first set worked fine until a few hours after they did an update.

From what I have seen OL, this appears to be a common issue - I have seen far more negative user reviews than positive reviews.

AUS$399 a set here."
2024-06-03,"Pros & Cons after one week of use:
Pros:
1) Sound is great, especially bass
2) Fit to ear is excellent
3) Active Noise Cancelling quite good: 8.5 / 10
Cons:
1) Bluetooth connection is very buggy. Connected to phone, then connected to PC and then earphones gets completely confused, refuse to connect to any device. I had to unpair/pair them several times, and phone connection is working again. 
2) Mic is not well protected from sweat. I was on cardio track and after 20 minutes, when I get really sweat, left earbud started to emit loud noise similar to scratching directly into my ear and voice assistant reported problem with Active Noise Cancellation."
2023-03-31,"The only option that I was looking for for the 2nd gen is that the left earbud can work independently, but unfortunately it doesn't...and that is a deal breaker for me.. Some people wants the single earbud  especially if they can use earphone at work.. Very disappointing... Still humongous in my opinion...  I'll pass on this one... Ill stick with my 1st gen even it is EXTREMELY HUGE."
2023-03-31,"Wife gave me a pair on Wednesday for my birthday. I love them so far. 
Edit: I am able to use each earbud independently. Did you adjust them in the Bose app?
Edit 2: apparently you can only use the right bud alone. Not the left."
2023-03-31,"I think the only missing feature I would regularly use is mono, but even then, how in the world do they think they can get away with charging $300 for something with less features than all of the major competition? This is a major miss for me."
2023-03-31,"In 2022, with a case and earbuds of this size, no wireless charging, just 6 hours per charge, no mono mode, impossible to deactivate ANC, no multipoint, no ADAPTIVE APTX or LDAC, and an astronomical price, 

The Airpods Pro 2 even if they are only 20% better than the previous ones will be the default choice for 90% of Apple users, and they still went from 4h30mn to 6h with ANC activated, volume management directly on the earbuds, and above all it's Apple.

In the Android world, Bose's proposal this year is difficult to justify against 1More, Soundcore, OnePlus Buds Pro, and other Sennheisers.

I think the Airpods Pro 2 will still roll over the competition."
2023-03-31,I was looking into these and that option to use them independently was the key I was going for .. even with only 6hrs battery life .️ I’ll continue my research with others . I appreciate the review
2023-03-31,"Well, no need to be disappointed I guess, some brand like bose or apple they don't need to compitied to such like soundcore putting everything in the dish which they normally call value. The only thing they do just focus on no others can compitied with them on what they are really good at... in bose's case noice canceling"
2023-03-31,That's odd because I have the original Bose QC buds and I can take out one earbud and listen to anything I want without having the other one out of the case and I don't have to leave the case open currently for this to work.
2024-03-30,"Having come from Sony MDR WF1000XM4 buds which I absolutely hated, I picked up the Bose QCII without reading any reviews on them. I based my purchase on an old pair of QC20i buds I had ages ago. And these QC2 buds do not disappoint. What do we buy them for mainly? To listen to music, podcasts, make/take calls or just enjoying the quiet. Second, we want them to perform well rather doing workouts, running, hiking out biking and etc. And they deliver! Third, One bud versus two, how they charge, color, are all on the bottom of the list of properties (for me). I’ll never buy another brand of buds except Bose."
2024-03-30,When did they fix the single use? Soon as I did the upgrade I could use the left ear bud by itself with the case closed but couldn't the first time I tried them.
2023-03-31,"Awesome review!  Hmmm... I love my new Sony Linkbuds S in every way, except range issues may be enough for me to return them, as any walls seem to disrupt their connection, where my Galaxy Buds 2 or Jabra 85t were fine.  My only ""must-haves"" are strong Call Quality, Ambient Mode, minimal Accidental Clicks, and Range.  Considering these preferences, do you feel the Quiet Comforts are a good alternative-- or is there another earbud you'd recommend?"
2023-03-31,"2:42 LOL!

How would you compare this to Beoplay EX? I'm struggling to make a decision!"
2023-03-31,I would venture to guess the removal of wireless charging was to shrink the case but still have a big enough battery for multiple recharges.  My other guess is that they don't want single use because it negates the primary selling point of ANC.  People are weird and it would affect the reviews.  This could be fixes by a software change in the future as well.
2023-03-31,"2:38 - I love how far you took the head shake! not only funny, but shows how well they really hold!"
2023-03-31,"Have both 1 and 2.
1 has the most secure ear fit with the wings, although a bigger overall and a bigger box.
Keeping 1st Gen."
2024-07-03,"Omg. I had the Bose Quiet Comfort Earbuds in 2020 and they were amazing! The mic was perfect, and the noise cancelling was superb. I lost them. I got the Bose quiet comfort 2 ones and the mic is HORRID, the noise cancelling is HORRID TOO. What did they change there?"
2024-03-30,"What do you recommend that is comfortable, decent mic, single usage. I do not like the wing tips on the beats fit pro they hurt and Apple either hurts or falls out of my ears."
2023-03-31,"Would like to see what you compare these to. I want to get them but my elite 7 pro have good mics and multipoint. Feel like multipoint should be a standard at this price and especially when they mention microphones so much.


Ah I’m conflicted, I want these but realistically the jabras seem like a better overall earbud. Got more useful features and do everything well."
2023-03-31,"Enjoyed the review (great job!) but the original QC earbuds DO have single usage mode for the RIGHT earbud. I use just the right earbud for calls constantly. Are you saying the QC 2 earbuds don't work this way? Also, can you still double tap the right earbud to answer and end calls?"
2023-03-31,"Which for do you prefer better, the silicon moon shaped tips or the redesign? The moon ones are the only types that stay in my ears. I am returning my beats studio buds because they just don’t stay in for me  I’ve been opting for the Bose earbuds with the cord over any wireless because of the fit and noise cancelation."
2023-03-31,"hey man, I got a question! I ordered the JBL Live Pro 2's based on your review and I found them to be amazing. However, I noticed that I could hear and 'feel' some low buzzing sound when the NC was turned up higher. It's not like the usual white noise like sound, but it sounds like constant thudding (in bursts sometimes) while using NC with or without music. I found it to be a dealbreaker for me, but I don't know whether this was a factory issue or not. Would you recommend to buy them once again or to look for other earbuds? (I already returned my current pair). Thanks in advance! :)"
2023-03-31,"I recently bought these & am completely unhappy with them. It’s almost impossible to get a hold of them to remove from the case. So annoying! I’m tempted to grab a knife or scissors & pry them out. And…I’ve tried everything (aside from scotch taping them to my head) & they fall out of my ears if I even slightly turn my head or move my mouth. I guess I can sit perfectly stone cold still to listen to music & get my $300 worth of use out of them. I also bought the Bose Sport with the winged ear pieces & while they do stay in, the sound quality just isn’t near as good as the Quiet Comfort."
2023-03-31,"Don't know if anyone has noticed this - in the user manual for the QCEIIs (downloaded from the Bose website) it states that when listening to music a double-tap skips to the next track and a triple-tap skips to the previous track; their website FAQ just says it skips back.  On my QCEIIs a triple-tap skips back to the start of the current track I'm listening to, not to the previous track.  I spoke to Bose support to find out whether the description in the manual was incorrect.  Their support agent spent about 15 minutes consulting with the tech team, and they suggested I might need to update the firmware - but I'm already on the latest (and as far as I know only) version.  Then I was offered a ""service"" replacement.  I've suggested that someone in their tech team just goes and tries it themselves and then tells me if the description in the manual is wrong.  If so, then for me I'd much prefer to be able to skip back to the previous track that just to the beginning of the track I'm listening to - then I know I can skip forwards or backwards through a playlist, instead of only forwards.  But I remember having a similar conversation with them on the previous QCEs...appreciate it if someone out there would let me know if their QCEIIs work the same way as mine (and I've tried them on iPhone and Sony Walkman/Android, so it's not a device issue)..."
2024-03-30,"I’m having trouble with people hearing me clearly with the earbuds 2.  The original sounds better to them.  I’m trying a replacement.

The music quality is better in the 2.

The wings don’t fit as securely, so i don’t know if that is partly why the sound is not clear on phone calls, or the music level is lower sounding with only one earbud.  They also still recommend using the right bud if only using one, even though you can use either one independently with the update.  That’s what i do now with the old ones.

I’m still undecided."
2023-03-31,I just bought the new Bose 2 earbuds and i have absolutely no problem using either ear bud independently
2023-03-31,"Great review good sir! I also would like to add that I did not like that the case was just a magnetic holder, there have been a few times where I have fumbled the other case and it stayed closed. But my raycons anytime I dropped them it would send the buds flying. And I can see that this case facilitates flying. Because the lid is going to take the impact force and jar open, and then the earbuds securely in place, will transfer the energy and shoot out lol!  I just feel that the case could have been another flatter design like it is but perhaps open up a bit differently because you need to pinch them out of the case in a certain way. Going straight at them as if I was going for the previous QC version one buds, and I kept slipping off of it. Figured out that I need to have my fingertip on that Ridge. And what that means is that I now have to finangle the earbud in my fingertips before putting it into my ear and twisting. So it has led to me dropping them a few times, but just on grass and carpet. And I am disappointed because you would have figured that all the little tiniest of things they would have thought about in their $300 earbuds. And I am seeing all the little things as being steps backward. You pluck an earbud out of the QC1 case, and you never have to reposition them in your fingers whatsoever, and thus you stop holding your pinch from initially plucking them out of the case, once they are securely in your ears. Not where I pluck these out, and while I'm holding my case with my left hand, my right fingers pinch it up, and now I have to roll them so that I am now pinching the sides. But now it is right on my fingertip, but it's down on my thumb so now I have to put my pinky and ring finger kind of under it to support it as I Let Go briefly and allow gravity to keep them in all of my fingers in an awkward position well I get to a perfect pinch. And you can see how this sucks compared to pinching the sides of the old buds and then not letting go until they are in your ear! I'll get good at it, we do have 90 days to return if you bought directly from Bo's which I'm pretty sure everyone has because this would be the first day you can get them and I don't think they are in stores yet."
2024-03-30,Man you just answered my questions.. I was calling for help and there was 39 callers before me. Excellent clear explanations. Thank you so much!
2023-03-31,"THERE IS NO “FIND MY” FEATURE!!! Or any other type of way to locate your earbuds. If you lose one, both, or both in the case, you are out of luck!!!!!"
2023-03-31,"Great review, it's crazy how when there's a new king in the crazy world of earbuds all of a sudden there's a new rival. I would like to see a comparison between The new Bose quiet comfort 2 and the Sennheiser TW3. And it would be great to hear it from an expert."
2024-03-30,"My sound peripheral keeps zooming in and out very annoying for the price, that’s not value but I’m going to try and get an exchange tomorrow and see if that helps"
2024-03-30,Is it impossible to escape Cosmetic damage to your gadgets like these ? I’m talking about little surface scratches and dents no matter how careful you are ? I always end up with cosmetic damage that pisses me off but it’s happened with everything I’ve ever purchased
2024-03-30,Bro o just took back my Nose Quiet Comfort 2 yesterday because I thought it didn't work with Android right. I didn't know you couldn't use one at a time. I do that all the time at work. But the noise cancelling was amazing and the sound quality was really good. Better then the pixel bud pro I traded out for by far.
2023-03-31,Good review.  Can you write how long it takes to connect to the phone?  The previous version (QC earbuds 1) took a long time.  Samsung or Huawei Freebuds headphones connect in about 2 seconds.  Has Bose improved the connection speed?  I am also disappointed with the lack of a multipoint connection.  This is a big minus for me.
2023-03-31,"How do you think because i'm considering to buy headphones BOSE QuietComfort Earbuds but I saw right now is a new model. How do you think, it's worth to but this new model or the old ?"
2023-03-31,"Independent usage so important for and they don’t have it, I don’t want to keep my case open all day since I use left one most of time NOT COOL, I was about to buy them because of Black Friday deal but you changed my mind THANK YOU"
2024-03-30,Excellent review! I love the sound but I do t have the success you have in keeping them in my ears. I’ve tried all the sizes of tips but it still falls out. When searching for an answer on the web this seems to be a common complaint.
2023-03-31,"I was literally about to purchase these, but the fact that they don’t have the individual usage is a total deal breaker. I’m the type to sit on my desk and listen to a podcast with only one ear bud on, I really don’t like to wear both earbuds at the same time, especially noise cancelling earbuds. Thank you for the review bro."
2023-03-31,"No way in hell am I paying 300 bucks for ear buds that aren't giving me things that $60 buds are. ANC is cool, but if you're not offering top tier sound quality, mic quality and other creature comforts them it's a hard pass for me. I'll stick to a dedicated headphone for true anc performance. You can typically find the Sony xm4 on sale for 199-250 every now and then and get a pair of the soundcore a40s for everything else."
2023-03-31,"Definitely appreciate your mention of the lack of single use mode. I haven't seen any of the other reviews I've looked at mention this and for me this is a critical must have. Thanks for taking the time to make this video. Straightforward, to the point, wish I'd come across it first and saved myself some time!"
2023-03-31,Great review as always dude. I love the way that you do reviews focused on what consumers would be thinking about and looking for in a product.
2023-03-31,"Great review, Thanks!  I own the OG  version but won’t be getting these.  With so much competition out there they can’t afford not to arrive half baked, especially at that price."
2023-03-31,"I've seen alot of mixed reviews online for Bose earbuds, whats surprising when their headphones are very much posative. The Bose earbuds have been a posative use for myself. The sound is really great, even more so with EQ adjusting in the bose music app. I will be honest, the wireless charging loss with the secound gen is disappointing to hear with it now being something I'm now a custom too. You can still use single use, it just works only leaving in the the right earbud and returning the left in the case, but yes both being able too would be good, but i don't mind it, works and you get used too. Multi use with devices I'm hoping they'll bring in a update, as its frustrating this isn't a more common ability on wireless earbuds still. Battery has been really great to be honest on the original Bose buds and i don't expect crazy battery life like 10hrs before need to put away to charge. due to the ANC which i can imagine drains alot, more so possibly then other brands. Comfort is great compared to others and zero movment no matter what you're doing, but the concept of the new earbuds looks to be a nice improvment, as the wing edge on the first gens were the first thing to cause discomfort, bare in mind that only occurs many hours later for myself. The main focus being the ANC is just a pleasure, and for me being sensitive with sounds and due to that a huge ANC junkie these are crazy good, can't wait to experience the second generation, but I hope they bring more bluetooth features in an software update as they have bluetooth 5.3 and the hardware appears all there."
2024-03-30,"Pretty much the only thing for me about these headphones is: every, single, time, I get in a vehicle and shut the door, no matter what settings I’ve tried, it sounds like I slammed the door with all of my might. I assume this is due to the pressure difference, but no matter the case, as a guy constantly getting in and out of vehicles all day that just won’t slide with me."
2024-03-30,"I was hesitating with sony xm5... I finally chose bose for a better fit and much less invasive, better ANC in mids.
I was super enthusiastic the first 3 weeks, the sound is not as bassy as bose used to make, and that's a good thing.
Now, those buds don't like being out of their case, I am sometimes falling asleep and I drop them on the nightstand... They get drained overtime like in use, then, if the battery is still up, they have a hard time to reco'nect to the phone and often play with lower sound on one earbud or totally off.
Puting them back in their base and taking them fix it most of the time, but 4 times I had to do a full reset.
Pretty annoying."
2023-03-31,what ear buds are the LOUDEST?! like REAL LOUD WITH GOOD SOUND of course...
2024-03-30,"Top quality noise cancellation and the sound. Using for 4 months . The only big issue is the charger case. I just dropped once and the top door is broken. There are lot of users reported same. It is a low quality plastic and cannot be glued. If you are not using silicon case , be aware that it will break for sure. Warranty replacement is not covered for that and new charger case is 99$. That is my only complaint."
2023-03-31,"Just purchasrd the BOSE QCII.. BLOWN AWAY!!!! Completely happy with them 100%.. 10 out of 10!! Sound 10, Fit 10, UI 10, APP 10, Case 9 ( quality but no wireless charging which is fine ) Tried many others and Bose has hands down BEST noise canceling, BEST sound.. Hands down.."
2023-03-31,"I'm thinking about moving form Jabra 75th to those earbuds. 
Should I?"
2024-03-30,So is it worth the upgrade from the originals ?
2023-03-31,"there was an update. now only one earbud works. but i didnt like the app and touch control functions. buds are connected, music is playing, then the app disconnects and the touch control is not possible anymore. no play/pause, no nothing ...

but anc is really nice"
2023-03-31,I am in the process of trying to figure out which brand I want and bose was one of them but I never saw this much smaller version I only saw the older one so I'm glad I came across your video.  I wonder why this new one never came up during my searches
2024-03-30,"I just received my new QC II buds. Like, an hour ago. 
ANC is fantastic - but the software update was 1.1.14 and the latest is 1.3.something... I couldn't hear or play music (iPhone 14 Pro, also new so not the issue). After the update they worked perfectly. 
I'm OK with the bass (first album I always play is Dark Side of the Moon); they sound great to me. 
Fit me right out of the box. I may fuss with the bands later on but the seal is good with the medium bands and medium plugs. 
Yeah at $300 they may be lacking for some. I don't really care about wireless charging - but I'd miss it if my phone didn't have it so I get it. You're paying $100 for the Bose logo, as with a lot of Bose stuff (I have a few of them around here). 
But mainly I wanted ANCs so I could mow the lawn without using my earmuff hearing protectors! Sounds weird yeah, but I have those old Sport Free enormous buds and the muffs didn't fit over them for beans. 
I may still get the Apple buds - at $100 cheaper they may do well enough. I never liked the form factor though, nor white stuff hanging off my head. Too bright. 
I got the slate grey color - special offer right now on Bose's website. I like them. 
OK flip side of the album coming up, Gotta go!  :D"
2023-03-31,Thank you for your honest review... Saved me ordering them and sendimv them back..
2023-03-31,"Hey there mate!

Any chance You could tell how's ANC compare to Jabra Elite 85t and Sony WF-1000XM4?

I'm using TW for Audible 3 - 4 hours a day and I vacuum clean during listening to Audible, so top notch ANC is my highest priority.

You have a super good point regarding two missing features [multipoint device connection and wireless charging], but I shouldn't miss them much.

Since my left ear bud fell into my toilet [lulz], I'm looking for something new and stronger [I'm on XM4 and EAH-AZ60E-K for the time being].

Thank You for Your eventual reply mate!

Great review btw! Love it!"
2023-03-31,I have had the QC earbuds for years and I never had a problem with taking one out and putting it in the case...just stops the music for a second and starts up again after about ten seconds.
2024-03-30,"Huge disappointment would be sound quality, battery performance or ANC not effective. Stop whining."
2023-03-31,Why are more people not upset about the non-ability to turn off sound canceling? It drives me CRAAAAAZY
2023-03-31,I can tell your review style is improving from when I first started watching you. Keep doing what you're doing man.
2023-03-31,"when I have them in my ears and I receive a call and I answer it always goes to the phone!! When i answer from the phone it should automatically goes to the buds, strange because I will be listening to something from the phone too!"
2023-03-31,"Just got mine today. Not sure they sound any better or even as good as the first version which I really enjoyed but lost. Need a little more time, maybe at gym this evening can make an honest comparison. Within first few minutes of wearing new set had one fall out of ear while in kitchen. Evidently need to experiment with the seals provided. Old set you put in ear, give it a little twist and it's pretty well locked in place.  I've had the top of the line airpods and in my opinion the sound & noise cancellation didn't come close to these."
2024-03-30,"I got mine a few days and since day one I've been having a connection issue, suddenly the connection falls by its own and the right earbud is off, this happens all the time"
2023-03-31,I called Bose customer service to complain about not having single bud usage.  They said they intend to fix that in the next one or two firmware updates.
2023-03-31,"I asked Bose Customer Service if these allowed single usage and they lied to me. The rep told me the new model fixed that issue, glad to hear the real answer before I ended up purchasing. I could deal with not having wireless charging, but not having single usage mode, especially at this price is ridiculous."
2023-03-31,I have been enjoying the WF-1000XM4s and Linkbuds S but you made a great point that at this price range they should not exclude wireless charging. Sony kind of justified that on the cheaper Linkbuds S. I will probably get the Bose QCIIs on a discounted price say $50 off but not at $299 especially now that the 2 Sonys are on sale at $178 and $128 respectively which are still solid buys.
2023-03-31,"You have been able to use the right independently, I do it everyday and the case is closed and away from me. You just can't do it with the left."
2023-03-31,single use mode is dedicated to the right earbud on the first gen. I would assume its the same on the second gen
2023-03-31,Shall i buy quiet comfort 2 or quite comfort?
2023-03-31,"Think I may have to eat humble pie - I've done some travelling and some walking with my QCEIIs in the last few days and have some reservations; in the past I'd have shared this on the Bose customer forum, but they took that down last year.  They do still display reviews on the website, but I couldn't find any way of posting a review there.  So here're my observations; I've been using the original QCEs for about 2 years, so this is largely a comparison with those:

THE GOOD...ANC is still the best I've come across - significantly better than the original QCEs (and actually better than my over-ear QC15s).  Audio is great; better soundstage; haven't played around with the equaliser yet.  Fit with the stabiliser bands and separate ear tips is much better than the old wing-tips, and they were pretty good.  Worth playing around with these - I used to use medium wing-tips; the QCEIIs come fitted with size 1 stabiliser band and medium ear tips.  I eventually settled on the size 3 band and the small ear tips (both sides); they stayed put walking and running.  One big difference was that I got none of the ""tramp...tramp...tramp..."" noise when walking on a hard surface that used to occur with the original QCEs - I guess that's due to a combination of the stability band fit and the reduced size/weight.  Another plus is that with the original QCEs if I was talking to someone next to me (OK or if I found myself singing along to a track my voice sounded (to me) like I had a frog in my throat - with the QCEIIs my voice sounds natural.

THE BAD...Hate the charging case.  It might be smaller and lighter and have an extra full charge in it, but taking out the earbuds on the move is very awkward.  You have to grip the top of the earbud, which is a shiny plastic, with your fingertips, and it's easy for it to slip from your fingers - don't want to have to crawl around under a plane or train seat trying to retrieve it.  You could pull on the top part of the stability band, but Bose warn against doing that when removing the band because it's easily damaged.  I see the Bose website has a video clip showing how easy it is to pop the earbuds into the case and snap the lid shut, but no video showing the case being opened and the earbuds being taken out.  Second issue with the case is that activities such as pairing requires the earbuds to be in the case with the lid open.  But if you put the case down flat (the only way you can put it down) the lid snaps shut, so you either need to prop it up or hold it.

THE UGLY...a couple of days ago I started getting short breaks in audio due to bluetooth disconnections - and sometimes when the connection came back it was to a different bluetooth device.  I went through all the usual fixes - deleting connections, re-pairing and eventually a full reset.  I tried my original QCEs in exactly the same way, and had no problems.  Then I found that when I connected to my iPhone or my iMac the connection was made but dropped after about 15 seconds.  I was able to get the BT connection to remain stable on my Sony NW-ZX507 DAP, so I went out for a long walk and tried that; it was a cold-is day (not anywhere near freezing).  No BT problems but I found the touch controls to be very unresponsive - they were fine at home.  I then did the same with my original QCEs - same walk, same temperature - and the touch controls worked perfectly.

So this morning my QCEIIs are on their way back to Bose for a ""service replacement"".  I'm hoping that I was just unlucky and got a glitched set of earbuds, or it's a known problem that'll be sorted with a firmware update (the Bose site has several reviews complaining about bluetooth)."
2024-08-02,"This is the third review I’ve watched and the first time I’ve heard about independent  earbud functionality. I just bought a pair today, and that’s a deal breaker for me, thank you."
2023-03-31,"I got mine today. They are so impressive! Over-the-ear headphones level ANC and very good sound. I think their sound is much better than SONY XM4s, and close to Sennheiser MTW3. Transparency is very natural like you don't wear anything. Just slightly worse than airpods pro when you speak."
2024-08-02,"Is it just mine , but I have a terrible time connecting them and it gets super annoying when you are at the gym"
2023-03-31,"My biggest issue with the original version is the size. I like to watch TV and movies in bed while my wife is sleeping and whenever I lay on my side, the original Quiet Comfort earbuds hurt my ears really bad after a relatively short time."
2023-03-31,"So glad to see you drop this video. You pretty much confirmed what I was already thinking... DISAPPOINTMENT 
Looks like I'll be keeping my Sennheiser MTW3 as my overall top favorite. Thanks for the dope ass review like always bro"
2024-03-30,"My huge disappointment of these earbuds is that they keep disconnecting from the smartphone (in my case, it's Samsung Note 8, it's for workout only), not sure why..."
2023-03-31,How well does it works on talking in the subway (inside the train cabin)?
2024-03-30,Love the review.  Was looking at them because refurbished are $159 at the moment but after the first generation I lost. Two dies not seem like an upgrade
2023-03-31,I don't know about y'all but... I bought mine like everybody else for $300 bucks. And I am very satisfied with my purchase. I sued to have the Bose sport earbuds witch were a lot louder. But with the noise cancelation it equals out. These are better than some of the other earbuds out.
2023-03-31,"ty man ive been on the fence about these or the airpod pros 2 for new premium earbuds and not being able to use just the left one is a massive deal breaker. going with the latter, crazy how one 10 minute review is more helpful than any of the comparison or deep dive vids ive watched."
2023-03-31,Have you enabled Google Voice assistant? Because on my Sony WF-1000xm4s I found out that I had enabled the voice assistant which meant that it would only work with the right ear at one time and not the left. So when I disabled Google voice assistant in the Sony app the problem resolved.
2023-03-31,"Hi great review like always 
My question is that I can get a some bose earbuds 1 for £129 and I’m just wondering do you think it’s worth paying extra for the bose earbuds 2 please thanks"
2024-03-30,Hi. I'm using this buds for three months. Mostly i have to reconnect again and again. Sometimes not connecting. Mostly i have to do is put the  buds into the case and take out to connect again. Have you got any idea about this issue?
2023-03-31,"when on the phone, can you use 1 ear piece and have the other ear piece on charge ? I have the BOSE QC  and it only has mic on the right ear piece."
2023-03-31,"I have to correct your statement re that you can only use one ear bud I just got these a week ago and tried taking r Budd off and the left bud works, also can control volume etc,maybe the software that did it.Good review .Cheers"
2023-03-31,"Thanks for a good review. Nice to hear about some things you don't like, although for me it's not a problem. However, all the other reviews just sing their praises so thanks for your honest opinon"
2023-03-31,Hi are there any widgets from the Bose apps that allow you to see things like battery life and connection status on your home screen without going in to the app?
2023-03-31,"Good video! Bose fans will defend these, but I'm going to pass on em'... It's 2022, too many things lacking and not everyone is looking for the ""best"" ANC just good enough. Personal opinion of course."
2023-03-31,I have trouble buying something I need my phone to use. Therefore I like the new version's ability to work directly. But for the price it shouldn't have lost other functions - as you suggest.
2023-03-31,"i like, bose, but this, especially their entire buds line up, is a bit like Apple case, they're quite overpriced for what they give, lacking a simple thing like wireless charging where it's a standard even in a price that's $100 less,  it lacks multi point connection, basically it lacks a basic features, where these price range were starting to give something more, like a more ""premium"" case, better material like soft touch, or even leather"
2023-03-31,"I don't see a video on the b & o ex and the left bose earbud has mics, would it be possible to update for independent use ?"
2023-03-31,"I used the first generation, but my main concern is that the connectivity with iPhones is really not up to par. Did not get any better but the new version?"
2023-03-31,"I agree on all points. I use the first version for work and need multipoint connection. I have a hearing issue in my right ear. Last, I work more than 6 hours a day."
2023-03-31,"These earbuds are really expensive but they worth the price if you want magical ANC. The ANC is at least as good as the headphone model. Now I use headphones at home and earbuds outside in public. Before I had the JBL live pro and next to Bose they virtually have no ANC. I can also add the the sound is good, the instrument separation and soundstage are good but not groundbreaking."
2023-03-31,"Great job on this review. 
Seriously, professionally done. 
I haven't been able to get ay earbuds to fit my ears besides Etymotic ER3 XR. I wish I could buy a shell of the Bose QC 2, no internal working parts, just a shell to see if they would fit/stay in. Im really ready for something like these."
2023-03-31,I have a hack for using them both separately one in one ear leave one in the case and take one out and they work perfectly separately like that if you take them both out of case and put one back it will shut them off
2024-03-30,I've watched dozens of videos . For me call quality at busy areas is most important ( I'm android user ) what's the best for me . some say liberté 4 nothing 2 or bose quietcomfort 2 . Pls an answer special for me .1 I travel by car none hears me if window a little open 2 i go to factories and show exebitions . I need to decide in 48 hrs . If bose are really better for me 300$ isn't an issue .
2023-03-31,I duuno should i buy the QC 45 or QC II Earbuds
2023-03-31,"I honestly wish I'd watched this before buying these. Having to choose between Siri and the ability to change modes on the earphones is ridiculous. You don't mention that. Why? No wireless charging is ridiculous. Last gen had both. No single usage mode is also weak but I never use it personally. It does come in handy when your batteries are dying, though! Charge one while using the other. Honestly these kinda suck for the price."
2023-03-31,Dead on. And another thing is I liked the leds on the old case letting you know how much charge was left. And when you pressed the button you could switch back and forth to devices that where paired.
2023-03-31,"Is it just me or is the following normal…
I put them on and even putting the canceling sound on low or completely off I feel like I can hear my breathing or like I’m underwater. I HATE that feeling. Even if I just keep one on still feels that way. Is it normal??"
2023-03-31,"You are perfectly right, a premium brand cannot launch earbuds without single use, multipoint, wless chge and, I would add, no way of turning ANC off. I would have liked you to say if the ANC has improved."
2023-03-31,I guess that the removal of wireless charging was the sacrifice for making the case smaller. That's a valid trade-off for me.
2023-03-31,"Thanks for your effort to make this review.
Could you please answer me about the ANC in this new version if there is a noticeable difference comparing to the previous version ?? 
I have already the previous version with limited edition color ""sand stone/ beige"" 

Thanks in advance"
2023-03-31,"All right when it comes to controls, I don't like it because it's a single tap to play and pause. I would rather go forward and backwards with three taps, play and pause with two taps I'm one bud, preferably my right, and two Taps to turn on and off the awareness mode or switch between your two selected modes on the left ear bud. I do not like the hold function you have to hold it there for nearly 3 seconds, where before you can do two quick Taps and get your hands doing whatever else you were doing so it's kind of a big deal for someone who might need to go back and forth between modes a couple times a minute depending on what I'm doing. I have a feeling that this is an easy programming fix that they can put in their selections and personalizations inside of the phone app. And yet I am sure I will never see it because it just seems to me like they're always has to be some give and take. And I've never had something come close to perfect. Another thing that can be done which I am sure we will see, is fixing the ANC because it is garbage! Like you said, some very soft noises like a door shutting as I pull it behind me while someone is talking to me, and all the sudden everything goes silent for a second and then comes back. It's way too sensitive and there's no option to turn down the noise protection feature. Driving down the road and I am in a navigator by the way, so it's a very nice suspension and good soundproofing, and every time I hit a little bump down this dirt road, it's as quiet as ever inside the vehicle, you more so feel it. It must be creating a low frequency thump that the earbuds are picking up and responding to, and it gives you this weird effect when you're going down something like a washboard road. So I'm hitting all these little bumps and it's responding to it, and then it's not responding to it and then responding to it again, it gives us weird buffeting effect, like when you have a rear window down going down the road and sometimes the air pressure builds up in the car and then it pushes back out and then it's able to absorb more pressure than push it back out.. the buffeting effect. I get the same thing out of these earbuds out of noises it really shouldn't be responding tool on the ear protection side, not the noise canceling aspect of it, but the ear protection or noise protection part of it. For me, I'm going to need to see some updates to fix all these issues or I will send them back right before the end of the 90-day term because I bought the previous version of the QuietComfort earbuds only 2 months ago out of walmart. Got the 3-year protection and everything. And because of the fact that I am pretty much seen with having these suckers on all day long, for whatever I'm doing, even when I'm out in the UTV riding trails, I'm usually using these earbuds. And that brings me to another final thing. I wish there was a mode, where it neither had awareness mode turned on, nor active noise cancellation. Then I could use it like I do my raycons as earbuds in order to block noise and I can shoot. Also, it doesn't work very good for four wheeling at all. I don't want to be anywhere on the scale of noise cancellation to one side an awareness on the other side. Picking a midpoint is not what I'm looking for. I'm looking for having those things to Simply turned off so that the buds are blocking noise, because like I said, then I could be able to shoot. Otherwise I have to use my raycons and I would love for there to be a reason where I didn't need Recons for anything. But their Simplicity in their design allows me to plan pause music, go four wheeling, and simply have everything muffled by the mere fact that I have something jammed in my ear. Closest you can get to these is letting the batteries fully die, and then you'll see what I mean."
2023-03-31,"Great review Sir; as usual.

QQ: Would the other bud even charge, if the case is not closed?  I would not think so."
2023-03-31,You mentioned there are better aware/ambient mode buds out there. Can you tell us which? Other than airpods please.
2023-03-31,"Strange, but when it's in my pocket or even when I am holding charging case outside of my person is anyone having partial disconnection issues where it disconnects for 3-5 seconds and then it goes back to normal on a consistent basis?

FYI: headphones are working without using the Bose app only through Bluetooth.  So, can this be the issue where if the headphones are connected through the Bose app it won't give this issue?"
2023-03-31,Excellent review brother. Looks like Bose dropped the ball on these.
2023-03-31,"So now that they have updated their firmware so that you can use a single earbud, how would you rate the product now? Is it worth the price tag? I have the first gen but don’t like that I can’t use the left without the right. Any suggestions?"
2023-03-31,"Couldn't even remember my Quietcomfort had wireless charging  my biggest worry was noise cancelling as it is my n1 concern. I really wish they would allow multiple pairing as when I'm on my mp3 I  wish I also could answer a phone call. This would have been a real game changer. Still my ear buds are going to my wife for these newest gen. Thanks, good review"
2024-03-30,I haven't even watched this video yet but I can tell you right now that I agree regarding the QCIIs.  I have both the QCIs and QCIIs and AFAIC the QCIIs basically suck.  Now I'm gonna watch the video to see what he has to say lol.  Will amend comment after.
2023-03-31,why would anyhone only want to use one ear bud?  I never understood that. good review though.
2023-03-31,"Thanks for the great review. With the original bose earbuds, the switching between apple devices was so incredibly buggy that it made me go for airpod pros despite bose having better sound and anc. Good to know from you that they completely ignored this issue and thus i will need to go with airpod pro 2… too bad."
2023-03-31,"Single usage is a big issue and at $300, Bose shouldn’t have eliminated wireless charging."
2023-03-31,"They do have a single usage mode, right bud out left in case with it closed. You just can’t do the left one like that."
2024-03-30,Thank you for the review.  If I remember correctly you made my decision from one of your others! Keep up the great work
2023-03-31,Are the ear tips in ear or like it’s predecessors?
2023-03-31,Would you say ANC has gotten better from prev gen? Or more of the same?
2023-03-31,Dont drop the charging case.. i dropped mine once and the top part that opens and closes broke off of it
2023-03-31,So if you talking just sound quality. Would you upgrade from the original bose quiet comfort to these new ones.
2023-03-31,I am considering buying the wireless earbuds either Bose or Apple. In saying that the fact that Bose does not have single ear use w/o the case being open and no wireless charging makes it hard for me to spend that kind of money on earphones.
2024-03-30,"The longing look on your thumbnail is ALL OF US!  I can’t get these stupid things to feel secure in my ear. I loved the wingtip. So WTF, BO?!  Yes, they’re just Bo now!"
2023-03-31,Been waiting for your review to drop! Now time to watch it
2023-03-31,"I haven’t looked through all your videos as far as comparisons go but I wanted to ask how you think these compare to the AirPods Pro version two as far as noise canceling, and sound quality?"
2023-03-31,"I am in the market for a good pair of wireless earphones and I am considering these but I have heard about the hissing sound when they are on and nothing is playing in them, in a few reviews. Does anyone know how bad it actually is or if it can be fixed in a software update?"
2023-03-31,"been using these about 6 months and I'm fucking passed off at them. the build quality of the case fucking sucks and the lid fucking broke off. they have shit tons of bugs in the headphones where sometimes only one of the buds plays audio regardless of being fully charged (yes I followed the instructions  that it said to do in the app, leave them in the charged case closed for a couple minutes etc.). I have tried every single fucking rubber combination so it can fit my ear and none of them work and they keep falling out. overall just a low quality fucking product but hey they got the best noise cancelling but imo I don't give a shit so many more cons than fucking pros"
2023-03-31,"Hey! I was planning on getting these, but not sure now. Which earbuds would you recommend for small ears, with good noise cancelling and sound? personally, I wasn´t happy with airpods, they always fell out. Now I have the Jaybird vista 2, they are ok, but their noise cancelling isn´t good at all. Wanted to try new ones with better noise cancelling and sound! Hope you can recommend me any, thank you."
2023-03-31,"Noice cancelling work good? Don't hear anythig on the background?
I have trubble with noicey neighbor i hope this can help me??"
2023-03-31,"I bought some but decided to return them. No wireless charging and only 18 hours of playback time with the case at $299 doesn’t seem worth it. Also, having an iPhone it’s about the ease of use that the AirPods Pro 2’s will provide plus wireless charging and the case giving you 30 hours at $50 less."
2023-03-31,"my bose soundsport gave out and no longer can be replaced, was hoping Bose wouldve stayed quality, so i wanted something more similar the Bose wired earbuds... looks like they gave up on quality in terms of audio.

guess im done with bose... not sure what to do now. ive used them for almost 10 years."
2023-03-31,"I took the replacement deal but I now regret it. I like the large case which was wireless rechargeable. Also I was able to switch from one device to the other by pressing the case button, which doesn't seem to work anymore. There was a glitch on finding my iphone or macbook. I had to keep resetting and erasing the device from bluetooth setting on my iphone. I am sending back to see if I got the lemon."
2023-03-31,"Sorry because if Beats does not put wireless charging on the FIT PRO no one talks about it, if it does not put it BOSE instead is a problem?
TO ME SINCERELY DOES NOT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE BECAUSE I HAD THE QUIETCOMFORT EARBUDS WITH WIRELESS CHARGING AND SOMETIMES I EVEN USE THE CABLE.
The real problem is that for better or for worse, nothing suits us and we find problems everywhere.
In my opinion the new QC EARBUDS 2 ARE EXCEPTIONAL AND I CAN'T WAIT TO HAVE THEM."
2023-03-31,Can you make a video comparing this to momentum 3 true wire please
2023-03-31,It actually does have single use mode.  Maybe firmware upgrade?  I was able to listed to the right or left earbud.  Did have to place the other in the case though.
2024-03-30,Can you still use one air Bud to listen to and have the other one in its case while closed or did they fix that update? Thank you.
2023-03-31,"Huge help having this video, I was thinking about getting these to replace my Sony's. But I think I'll stick with my Sony's for a while longer. Thanks man."
2023-03-31,"I have the 1st gen of the bose NC buds as well as the airpods pro 2. The new apple offering blows away the 1st gen bose buds for noise cancellation. I don't have the 2nd gen bose buds, but I'll continue to use the 1st gen for running until the battery dies. My default to grab for just listening are the airpods. I only use the bose buds for running currently as the wing tip guarantees they stay in my ears."
