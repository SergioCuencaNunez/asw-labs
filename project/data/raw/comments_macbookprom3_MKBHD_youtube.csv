2024-03-27,"Crazy how mkbhd doesn’t need a good studio setup to make a great video. Just takes up his Canon R5, starts shooting and speaking like a pro. Love it."
2024-03-27,Congrats on being added to the roster. Best of luck to you and your team.
2024-03-27,I think the reason behind the constant comparison of M1 and M3 is that the M1 computers are still so good that people may not otherwise upgrade.
2024-03-27,"As usual great video, great insights"
2024-03-27,"My jaw dropped when I saw that text at the end. That to me was the most impressive outcome from tonight's keynote. I, like you, want to see the BTS of the making of this keynote. I hope they have that planned because it will sell a lot more phones.

I'm also glad there's no need for me to upgrade my 14"" M2 Pro MacBook. Although they need to keep that space black color around for when I do in a few years."
2024-03-27,"Hardware support for Mesh Shading is a huge deal. It's been on nvidia and AMD's card for ~3 generations now, but finally having it means a lot for 3d graphics, enabling previously impossible polygon counts."
2024-03-27,He knew we were just here to see his reaction to the space black MacBook and he kept us on the edge of our seats lmao
2024-03-27,"Always amazed at how you do the most organised, concise memory dump of your thoughts and all makes sense, no omissions, no double mentions, just perfect, many thanks for your way of creating videos!"
2024-03-27,Would be interesting to see an M1 Max compared to a standard M3
2024-03-27,"When they decided on matte black for the M3 line, they definitely had you in mind! I can't count how many time you've asked for matte black"
2024-03-27,"If MKBHD is not pushing his M1 Max Macbook Pro, there is no way I'm pushing my M2 Mac Mini. I'm very interested to see the lineup of games coming along the new GPU techs."
2024-03-27,"I’m an astrophotographer working on a 15” 2015 MacBook Pro rn and I’m thinking about upgrading to an m3 MacBook Pro. I honestly can’t wait to make the jump. Also, marques that video quality is so good and we NEED those ultimate frisbee highlights! Keep up the incredible work!"
2024-03-27,"Good luck in the match! I'm one of the M1 Max MBP users and while I'm probably in their use case as I do a lot of ML and Software Dev - I think I'm going to wait. The Space Black is an intriguing color, but between fingerprints and the inevitable scratches - I don't know if I can do that color. In your review (or when you talk to Apple), ask them about scratch resistance. A silver MBP hides all the small nicks and scratches very well."
2024-03-27,I just started filming things on my 15 Pro and I must say the new pro res log format is a game changer. It doesn't surprise me the even was shot on an iPhone because the new iPhone video processing is amazing.
2024-03-27,A YouTuber at his level editing his own video on a laptop in a hotel... This is what makes Marques a superstar. What a work ethic
2024-03-27,"I gotta say, starlight has been a great colour for me. It's subtle but also really nice to not have just grey, plus not too fingerprinty"
2024-03-27,Congrats on your team USA Roster addition. You're the man. Incredibly inspiring to see your journey.
2024-03-27,The end message was the most surprising thing of the whole event for me. I was actually thinking during the event why they don't record it on the iPhone since they praise their video quality so much... I didn't see this coming.
2024-03-27,M1 is sooooo good I don’t see myself upgrading for another 3-4 years. It has aged so well and it would take more than just a color to upgrade.
2024-03-27,I think the M3 chip is designed to attract customers that a) haven't made the jump from intel processors yet or b) purchased an early model M1 chip product. Its kind of like when some people (like myself) who don't like to purchase a new phone year on year but rather skip a year so that I can really notice the boost in performance and efficiency
2024-03-27,Marques always being insanely fast on these Apple updates and insights.
2024-03-27,Really interesting that this is finally hitting the mainstream because when it comes to Macs (and phones) but I've been noticing more and more people who just don't bother to upgrade anymore. OR if we need a computer we just walk in and buy the cheapest thing Apple has and it's more than powerful enough for 99% of tasks.
2024-03-27,3D content creators might benefit the most. I'm eager to see performance tests with Blender and Cinema 4D. I'm curious how the new Macs stack up against Windows laptops in this area.
2024-03-27,"I like this format. No graphics. Not that the MKBHD can't make, but they obviously chose to keep it simple. Casual and interesting"
2024-03-27,So happy that all your hard work is being honored with being part of the tournament. People probably underestimate the hard work and commitment to get there.
2024-03-27,"It's inspiring to see that even after all of these years, with a full-blown staff and studio behind you, you can still just grab a phone camera and pull off a straightforward, no bells-and-whistles, video just like that. Thanks Marques for providing quality content no matter what method you choose!"
2024-03-27,Congratulations on making the team.  Thank you for sharing with us your thoughts on the recent Mac Event even though you are preparing for the Ultimate Freebie Beach World Championships.  Greatly appreciate it and you.  Take care and have fun.
2024-03-27,"Huge congratulations on competing at WBUC. Have fun!  I’m sure USA will do well (but, go GB!).  And thanks for the timely reminder that I need to check for livestreams.

My many months decision making process is heading towards a Mac mini, to replace my non-windows 11 compatible computer.  So some more delaying while I decide to find a deal on M1/M2 or wait for M3 Mac Mini."
2024-03-27,"Hardware ray tracing is probably the most significant upgrade from the M2, and was the biggest feature that the Apple Silicon GPUs have been missing since their launch. Nvidia is now on their fourth generation of GPUs with hardware accelerated ray tracing."
2024-03-27,"I too was blown away when I saw ""Shot on iPhone"" at the end of the Keynote. I have the 14PM and I couldn't be happier with it, but the 15PM sure does feel like an upgrade I would appreciate."
2024-03-27,"I think they understand that it might take 2 gens before people are upgrading. Same w/ phones. Things never sound like major upgrades if you have the most up to date thing, but if you're a couple gens behind, they might become interesting."
2024-03-27,"I have the base M1 Mac with 8 gigs of Ram and 256 gigs of SSD only, so honestly I think the M3 Pro with 36 gigs of Ram and 1TB of storage seems to be a huge improvement to me :D"
2024-03-27,"My favorite part was when they compared M3 performance to M1



Edit: Yes I realize most people still have M1, I refuse to upgrade because of how good that chip is. I just thought it was a little funny to not compare it to your newest chipset as much as your oldest one :p"
2024-03-27,"I hope the reason they aren’t releasing a USB C keyboard, mouse, and trackpad, is that they are redesigning the Magic Mouse. It would make sense to keep both bundled accessories using the same port, so I expect they will not stagger the release of them. The Magic Mouse at least needs a new charging port location, but a change to its ergonomics would also be welcome."
2024-03-27,Congrats for getting to team USA.
2024-03-27,My M2 Max MBP is already the perfect laptop to me. I'm surprised Apple decided to upgrade it so quickly after its release. The GPU upgrades would be exciting if more games were available.
2024-03-27,"As an architect, my general laptop is an M1 Max, but I've needed to keep a high end Windows/NVIDIA machine just for autodesk software and live 3D high res modeling w/ray tracing (unreal/twinmotion).  Interested to see if we might be able to go all mac soon."
2024-03-27,"Oh wow. The fact that it was shot on iPhone is unbelievable, but what makes it mind blowing is the fact that they had such dark scenes and still looked amazing. I couldn’t have told it was shot on an iPhone"
2024-03-27,"M3 improvements from M2 are really miniscule. A very minor update for general use, but it does unlock some niche features and workflows"
2024-03-27,"Great video! Would be nice to see a comparison between M2 Pro Chip with M3 Pro Chip, as the numbers of CPU/GPU cores are interesting."
2024-03-27,The fact that the entire event was filmed on iPhone 15 Pro Max is mind blowing!
2024-03-27,"Marques had me smiling when he said ""Amazing Production"" 
I can only imagine what wonders the MKBHD team would do if they were the guys behind the next Apple Keynote. 

PS: Thanks for this update. You are an absolute treat to watch Marques"
2024-03-27,"Congrats on the frisbee roster! Massive props and best of luck, Marques <3"
2024-03-27,"I have the fan-less MacBook from early 2016. 
Still works very well and is in good condition. Although the battery is far worse than how it was before. 

So I definitely plan to upgrade once the 14” becomes available."
2024-03-27,Sticking with my M1…although that space black color alone is tempting
2024-03-27,"I think it's reasonable that they compared with the M1 products since the people who own M1 are the most likely to be buying these new macs. That being said, I have an M1 Pro 14"" MacBook Pro base spec and it's fantastic. Still very fast, great battery life, awesome speakers and screen etc. No plans to upgrade until maybe the M5 or M6."
2024-03-27,Yup. My M1 Max still blows my mind every time I use it. They did too good. Going to need to slow it down with software updates for me to upgrade.
2024-07-30,The epitome of exploration and vibe through explaining from MKBHD is the HABIT that I loved to dive into
2024-03-27,"With how good the M series of chips have gotten,  I wonder if Apple will try their hand in the gaming space again. With a bigger cooling system, I think an optimized and gaming focused M chip could have some solid performance."
2024-03-27,"If you have to compare M3 with your older M1 chips to make the difference seem bigger then it really shows how small the actual improvement is, Also a ""Pro"" Macbook with 8gb of ram in 2023? and don't get me started with the 256gb of storage in the NEW m3 imac"
2024-03-27,"i can tell you for coding it's phenomenal. at work i use a m2 mini and i haven't upgraded my personal laptop since i got the m1 air. fast, reliable and portable. used to be a linux poweruser and decided to get the cheaper m1 air, haven't touched a non apple computer since then."
2024-03-27,"It would've been fantastic had they ended the Scary Fast event with ""Edited on a MacBook Pro""."
2024-03-27,"There are three types of Mac that might have a big difference. The iMac, the new base level 14” Pro and the Mac’s with the M3 Pro Max in. The first two are obvious but the Pro Max on had the biggest leap in graphics performance. So it’ll be interesting to see if this makes a difference in real world applications."
2024-03-27,Thanks for summing it up nicely. I recently got my MacBook M2 pro and was almost pissed for a minute because I was not expecting a M3 so soon. But I can rest easy tonight. Great video like always
2024-03-27,"2 weeeks ago I bought M2 Max Mac Studio, 64GB RAM 1TB Storage. So I think it's enough for me for next 7 to 8 years."
2024-03-27,“New Mac sales have not been growing as much as they wanted” Tim Apple: “make them pay $200 for 8gb more ram”
2024-03-27,"I will say, as someone in the video space who davbles in 3d effects, hardware raytracing is extremely exciting. The 3d compute performance of the M series chips is the biggest thing that's still holding them back imo. Probably not upgrading this gen but very happy that apple is heading that direction"
2024-03-27,They totally built that laptop for you! I remember how well the I don't need a Model S Plaid went. You are going to upgrade to this!
2024-03-27,"Just got a M2 Mac a few months back, and it is so good that I have yet to see a reason to upgrade outside of their new hardware ray-tracing features. Apple did wonders with their own silicone chips, and they're so good it may take til the M10 chip for me to upgrade."
2024-03-27,CONGRATS!! PROUD OF YOU!!
2024-03-27,Congrats on the ultimate frisbee spot Marques! It’s an amazing achievement and a great thing to see your goal come to fruition. Good luck
2024-03-27,"Your production speed is unreal. 

I like the new lineup. But I’m OUTRAGED about the Magic Mouse charging being lightening still and underneath"
2024-03-27,"I bought an Mac M1 MAX fulled spec'd out when they launched 2 years ago...I hear my fans coming on more and more as I try to photoshop and FCP...with a big excel sheet open...M2 was not enough for me in January...but this...this is worth it. Space black, sealed the deal. Arrives 11/15."
2024-03-27,I proud myself too on having participated in a World Cup tournament of bocci for my own country of kahzakistan
2024-03-27,"Can we just acknowledge what a calm, sincere, wholesome voice MKBHD is in this more and more sensational internet?"
2024-03-27,"Great video, especially, creating this from a hotel room!  I've seen other channels speculate that some of the biggest improvements of a 3 nm chip have to do with 2 big improvements in efficiency and one performance improvement.  As I understand it, the 3 benefits derived from that upgrade in efficiency are: 1) Lowered power consumption, i.e. less wasted natural resources and longer battery life, 2) Lowered heat generation, and 3) improved performance under heavy loads because with less heat generation also comes less performance throttling.  Although I do modest amounts of video editing and zero gaming, I definitely AM interested in using my computer for flight simulation as a serious flight training resource.  Flight Sim programs are notorious for using only one graphics core for 99% of the work.  Historically, this has run computers HARD and very HOT.  That's a problem if a person's workflow also works better with a laptop because a lot of work requires computer use while ""out in the field"".  If a computer could do the heavy lifting required by Flight Sim programs when I'm home, but could also be portable when I'm working away from home (laptop), that would be the Holy Grail of computers for me.  Maybe I'm overly optimistic, but the combination of efficiency and performance made possible by the M3 seems like it might fulfill all of that?  The efficiencies of the M1 and M2 were fine as far as power draw, but were still not quite there with heat dissipation as far as Flight Sim and 3D rendering work.  My sense is that the 3 nm technology promises a big reduction in heat generation.  Any thoughts on this?  Is this a test you would be interested in doing?  Thanks Marques!"
2024-03-27,"Enough for M1 or Intel based MacBook users to upgrade, definitely not for those using M2. Unless you're digging that beautiful matte Space Black finish"
2024-03-27,"A friend of mine who's getting her PhD in microbiology and I (studying biology) had a good laugh when Apple showed their ""Lab""-Scene. It was just so absurd and stylised xD"
2024-03-27,"I have an M1 Max 64GB 4TB... not upgrading yet, though that color, love it. I am one of those who maxed out from day 1. 3D rendering and animation___ we always need more!"
2024-03-27,This guy is representing the entire USA on YouTube and Ultimate Frisbee. And he doesn't even make it that big of a deal. Very humble dude
2024-03-27,"The upgrade is really a push for those of us late adopters who are still on the last generation of intel based Mac’s. It’s finally time, I ordered an M3 Max last night."
2024-03-27,I have maybe a dozen subscriptions and this channel is one of them.  Good luck on the frisbee.  Thanks for sounding off on the unexpected news.
2024-03-27,"Congratulations Brodie, I know you’ll do us proud!! 🇺🇸

Currently have a 2018, 128gb i5 13 inch MacBook Air, and I think this will be the year I upgrade…Looking at getting the 14 inch m3 pro 1TB, MacBook Pro."
2024-03-27,"The most interesting component for me is the base price drop for the 14” MBP with M3. If you bump the memory up to max at 24gb and bump the storage to 1TB, and then do the same with the 15” Air with M2, it’s only $100 more to get the MBP. That to me is a no brainer and I’m surprised they cut the price of the base 14” that much, because it’s absolutely going to cannibalize the sales on the M2 Air."
2024-03-27,Glad you spoke about how they focussed on the M1 vs M3 and not so much the M2 vs M3 - having an M2 max MBP was getting that fomo feeling but calmed myself down after seeing this and the launch figures.
2024-03-27,That crooked lamp drove me crazy LOL
2024-03-27,Apple dropped the price for the M3 MBP14 base model (which I was happy) then I noticed they also dropped to 8gb base RAM… which was the hilarious thing to me cause adding another 8gb returns the price to normal. Such a disappointment for a Pro model to have 8gb to begin with.
2024-03-27,"Congrats on the US team representation, best wishes man! BTW hilarious that you have a Windows 10 wallpaper on your MacBook"
2024-03-27,I have an almost 3 year old HP notebook at work. All my colleagues got a MAC . The black 14“ with M3 Pro is what I‘ll be aiming at. Also great seeing a „cheaper“ MBP with M3 and all the benefits like the Mini LED display. Only 8GB of RAM for a 2000€ machine (here in Germany) is completely outrageous though..!
2024-03-27,"This is so weird: Macbook Pro now starts at a lower price, but why tf it also starts with 8g + 256??? and they even put M3 into the pro lineup lol"
2024-03-27,A 15% improvement is a huge improvement. I was impressed tonight and I’m shopping tomorrow.
2024-03-27,"I kind of like this style of videos as much, if not better. Very simple, and that's the way I like these impressions videos anyways. Good luck on your tournament!"
2024-03-27,Cool for me that they focused on DNA sequencing  - I love my M1 MacBook Pro for my single cell transcriptomics work and a few years ago it would have been quite difficult to do that work on a laptop. I won’t be replacing mine just yet but maybe the next model.
2024-03-27,"It’s all choked up. Whatever tech stuff you buy today , it’s old tomorrow. So never be proud of your devices, better learn to keep them for years. I still use my late 2007 MacBook which doesn’t even have a working battery no more."
2024-03-27,"I like the Touch Bar, sad it’s gone"
2024-03-27,"i'll be sharing this video with my family as they love Apple. thank you for the video, and all the editing you do to make your videos that much better. Happy Halloween. Congratulations  on   being added to the team. good luck."
2024-03-27,"It would have been an easier break for decision to update if the MacBook also had other updates, like FaceID or Dynamic Island other than the color.  It will be interesting to see if its worth the update form M1 to M3 and continue to welcome your videos and reviews"
2024-03-27,I'm rocking a 14inch M1 Pro here and I don't see myself upgrading this thing for a pretty good while. It's just too good.
2024-03-27,"The Apple M Series of chips is already so good and far ahead of the competition that they can easily afford to have just minor spec bumps. I am very glad to hear that the competition, like Snapdragon, are looking to actually, finally, catch up. As a Windows and Android user, I'm not super enticed by some aspects of how MacOS works (or doesn't work) with third party devices and software. For now, my work computer has to be provided by my work anyway, and my personal windows laptop from a couple of years ago is still more than capable of keeping up with what I need it to for now. But these MacBooks are so good that, if I was in the market, I'd really be considering adapting to using MacOS, especially if the competition ends up falling flat. Still not switching to iOS, lol.

btw, I liked the casual, almost vlog-style hang out vibe of this video. good luck with the tourney."
2024-03-27,Congrats Bro on the selection and good luck to your Frisbee game. Achieving and following your passion is inspiring even at people like me at 40's. And yes the Space Black / Matte Black is actually tempting :)
2024-03-27,Congrats on representing our country! Looking forward to the upcoming Mac videos!
2024-03-27,"""The reason I haven't updated this in years…'. 9 months. It was 9 months that an upgrade to the M2 Pro/Max was available. I feel like people inside this world lose track of just how short these timeframes are when they're reviewing things in a constant stream. Not an attack, just an observation."
2024-03-27,"As usual great video, great insights. But I'm curious: how is your audio so clean when you're recording outside your studio? Is it the mic or special editing technique/workflow? Really appreciate an answer."
2024-03-27,"Impressive launch, but I think I'll keep my M1 MBA for now. Probably until the M3 filters down to the 13"" Air. What I really, really want to see though is a black magic keyboard with touch ID that isn't the full size with numeric pad."
2024-03-27,More laid back videos like this . Edit: I also use the M1 Max laptop. I plan on keeping it until 2025 at least. I have apple care til then ha
2024-03-27,As soon as I saw the shot on i phone text - my jaw dropped ....
2024-03-27,"The fact they compared the M3 chip performance mostly to M1 and even Intel based MACs makes me think that they are not trying so much to sell M3 to M2 users, but more to people who bought M1 MACs 4-5 years ago"
2024-03-27,Space black is everything!
2024-03-27,"As usual, I appreciate your take on things.  I have an M1 MacBook Pro as well and just can’t justify upgrading. It doesn’t mean I wouldn’t want to get one but I don’t do anything at the moment that taxes my M1. I do like the Space Black color.  I used to upgrade my devices more frequently but haven't done so in the last few years.  Good luck with the tournament!"
2024-03-27,"For majority of People who use a Laptop for personal use like browsing the Internet, Emails, School or College work, watching Movies or listening to Music, etc...the M1 is still gonna rock pretty solid for that.
If you're a high end Computer user who needs more power for Video Editing, Software Development, some form of Digital Business etc...then go ahead, upgrade."
2024-03-27,"dynamically allocating memory to the gpu is a pretty underrated feature in terms of getting the best performance out of the hardware, I imagine it was also very difficult to implement"
2024-03-27,Benchmark scores are reaching phone number levels these days and im all for it
2024-03-27,"Reaction to the matte black was the same as mine, regardless of all the tech improvements, and now I'm looking at my M1 Max like.... 

Congrats on the roster, go team!"
2024-03-27,"You called it, Apple released a behind the scenes of their how they shot the event on the iPhone 15 Pro."
2024-03-27,"Great first impressions, @MKBHD! Your initial take on the MacBook Pro was insightful and informative. Can't wait for the full review!"
2024-03-27,"Have both the M1 Max 64 gb and the M2 Max 96 gb (personal and work), and I definitely do notice a slight performance bump of the better machine but like you said, it is not very noticeable. But damn, that black color lol."
2024-03-27,"I was getting the vibe that they know how many people they have using M1 and that was who they’re trying to sell on the upgrade. Because of all the reasons you mentioned. 
Definitely hilarious that most people still just use these things for word processing and browsing the internet though."
2024-03-27,"I love how chill this video is, just Marques and a camera. Good luck with the Ultimate Frisbee tournament!"
2024-03-27,"Dude! I was wondering the whole time during the event, how much lighting power did they consume to the that much of depth of field during night time filming indoor and outdoor. It looked like a wide angle lens maybe 24mm or wider at least f8 or f11 even f16 maybe. So they cranked up the light output so high in the lab to get the DOF? But the Pro Display XDR screen looks correctly exposed. But match the video light output on the subject (person) with the display at f/11 gonna be tricky. And outdoor shot? They shot at iso 12800 on a fx3? I just had so many question regarding the filming and lighting (assuming it was shot on a mirrorless camera at least.) Then I caught that shot on iPhone at the end. Then it all makes sense….So a ProRes Raw and Apple log actually turn off the notorious oversharpening on iPhone, that sounds promising."
2024-03-27,The Space Black looks so good!  But the most impressive thing was that the event was shot on an iPhone  Great video as always and best of luck!
2024-03-27,"They should really do this every two or three years. It would create expectation and more people would upgrade their laptops. When it is a yearly lauch, it loses interest.
I get that on a phone, even when I upgrade mine every 4 years, but a new computer chip every year is just too much. I have my Macbook Pro M1 Pro and it is incredible. It works incredibly, and I am sure a very low percentage of people will upgrade their M1 or M2 now. It just doesn’t make sense.
Good luck in the tournament!"
2024-03-27,Love watching your videos.   The GOAT in tech reviews.  Thank you
2024-03-27,And Apple released a behind the scenes!
2024-03-27,CONGRATS on making it on the team and good luck!!! I think that the most interesting bit for me is the ray tracing and can potentially can play AAA games finally!
2024-03-27,Excellent analysis as always. We love the matte black design.
2024-03-27,There seems to also be a Mac Mini Space Black in the keynote in the lab when Johny Srouji talks about the M3 chips. Visible around 08:00 minutes into the keynote
2024-03-27,"Another great job ! Even as a simple vlog from travel about your Apple event thoughts it’s soo cool to watch, very interesting and great quality !  Go Team USA !!!"
2024-03-27,"Man, if I would've gotten the M2 MacBook Pro when it released earlier this year I now would've been pretty salty. That was some quite update, and now I'm probably finally going to swap out my 2015 MacBook Pro for a new M3 one. Also love the new black finish."
2024-03-27,"I’d love to see a video from you after you deeply reviewed the Snapdragon X performance, because for me it seems that Apple threw away the 3-year’s tech advantage. Was really this MacBook Pro evolution needed with 3 nm but an architecture that is really nothing great compared to M1. Indeed they compared the performance all along the keynote with Intel Mac… still??? Looking forward to see your detailed analysis. Great video as always Marquese."
2024-03-27,The most interesting news in this video was the ultimate Frisbee Team USA dream. I hope this comes true for you.
2024-03-27,"I was really surprised that this event was shot on iPhone 15 pro max! Because I didn't expect them to shoot such a big event on an iPhone! So when Marques said ""wow, I did not see that coming!"", I totally agree and had the same reaction!"
2024-03-27,10:44 behind the scenes are out
2024-03-27,"The quick launches of the M2 & M3 make me not want to update my current M1 Pro out of fear they'll bottleneck it. The M1s are so darn great already, and I do a lot of processing in different intensive programs, not had any issues at all compared to my Intel!"
2024-03-27,not apple literally releasing a behind the scenes right after this
2024-03-27,"I thought the M3 MBP was finally the one to make me upgrade from my 13” 2014 rMBP but then I noticed that for your £1,700 you only get 8GB RAM and it can only support one external display  what on earth are Apple thinking!? A MacBook PRO that can only power one external display 

The black one does look pretty cool though."
2024-03-27,When you said that maybe upgrading from M1 or M2 wasn’t necessarily worth it I thought well maybe I’ll take the leap from my 2014 MBP  great video
2024-03-27,"Congrats on making the team! Good luck! This is the real story. A matte black case will cook if you are working outdoors in the sun. Edit: if you get one get a handheld IR thermometer ""gun"" as well and report back ..."
2024-03-27,Bruh people are talking about upgrading their M1 and i’m still here with my imac 27” late 2013. Still using logic and fcpx lol. I just wished they would’ve announce a new 32” imac
2024-03-27,"I was so excited to see that they got rid of the 13 inch MBP and gave us almost everything the 14 inch MBP had (less on usb 4/ lightning port) and was also happy to see that they started it out with 512 gb’s of storage with the base model with the regular m3 and 400 dollars less than and M2/M3 pro was….but what really killed it for me is that they still left it at 8 gb’s of unified memory. In fact all the unified memory configuration’s are weird. With the rumors going around plus apple having a lot of multiple’s of 12. I was really hoping they were going to give the base model that 12 gb starting memory. I get they needed to save somewhere but oss port and a non pro chip i think would have been enough. Atleast give us 12 gigs apple. 16 would have been great but 8 just isn’t enough in 2023/24 for 1600 dollars. Anyways that’s my rant, great video as always marques, can’t wait for the reviews. Peace ️"
2024-03-27,"$1600 for a base model m3 macbook pro (8 core cpu, 10 core gpu, 8gbs of memory,  512gbs of ssd storage) is just simply outrageous!"
2024-03-27,"I think this time M series will be about adoption rather than speed. Trying to integrate x86 apps into ARMs through Apple silicon. Probably for 90% adoption is around 5 years. I think by M5 or M6 we'll get a better look at how this silicon would be mostly useful and even more tightly integrated. For now, it won't be a massive improvements like smartphones and desktop CPUs will."
2024-03-27,MARQUES IS LITERALLY A YOUTUBE GOAT + US OLYMPIAN AT THE SAME TIME BRAHHHH!!! WHAT A LEGEND MANNN
2024-03-27,"My M1 Pro is still doing pretty well. I’m thinking it’ll probably be time to upgrade around M5, if they’re still named that by then. And even then, I could probably replace the battery and keep rollin for another couple years. (Unless apple software locks the battery lmao)"
2024-03-27,I like this space black color. Hope apple brings this to the air series next year too!
2024-03-27,"It’s very interesting that they chose to use AI instead of ML this time. Anyway, amazing video! keep it up!"
2024-03-27,Thanks!
2024-03-27,"The new black they have, I have to admit looks absolutely sick!"
2024-03-27,Siempre puedo aprender algo nuevo de este maestro. Por cierto qué increíble cómo ha logrado prácticamente 100k vistas en 30 minutos. Gracias por traernos la información super rápido MKBHD. Te respeto.
2024-03-27,"They released a 2 minute video of behind the scenes for this event. The equipment itself might have costed them a Million Dollars . But, as you said, amazing quality video production."
2024-03-27,Thank you Marques. It was very insightful. Was a PC user since the early 90’s. Bought a primo iPad a couple years ago and liking it. Thought I would head for a laptop again. Thanks.
2024-03-27,"Something I haven't seen anyone talking about what the hardware supported dynamic memory allocation in the new GPUs. Most obstacles in performance come from effectively distributing loads across threads/cores, and this is even more true for GPUs. It sounded from their announcement that they had achieved some kind of new breakthrough, where the memory allocation happens 1.) transparently to the programmer and 2.) closer to optimally depending on the task at hand. I don't know the details but if this is real then it could be a big deal for Apple, especially if it's patented."
2024-03-27,"MKB's ""The Man!"" He's my all time #1 go-to tech product analyst with serious non-fanboy shit on any level...He's just gives a thorough ""True Blue"" brutally honest assessment of the products he's reviewing! The dudes ""Outta da Pawk"" Awesome! Love this guy!"
2024-03-27,Congratulations very nice job that you made it this far.Not Surprised by this news.Hope you do great. I hope you do check the new out and it does have your name all over it.Thanks so much for sharing and I also enjoyed the event .️
2024-03-27,"I have an M1 MacBook Pro and it is still an absolute beast. Never runs slow, a fan has never turned on and the battery life is still as amazing as when I first got it. Plus, I love the touchbar."
2024-03-27,"I like that what convinced MKBHD to upgrade is not the performance, but the colours"
2024-03-27,"I love the Touch Bar on my 13” M1 MacBook Pro  Mostly utilized for screen capture, brightness, and volume"

2024-03-27,"""Hello MKBHD,

I've been a big fan of your content for a long time, and I really admire your work. I was wondering if you have any older laptops hiding in the dust that you'd be willing to give me instead of throwing away. I understand if it's not possible, but I thought it couldn't hurt to ask. Thank you for considering my request.

Best regards, Dan..
Stupid question but still asking, at least say no...
To understand , I have no laptop or computer at all and my school is gonna kill me..."
2024-03-27,"1:30, great description of what Clayton Christensen calls the 'good enough' point where disruption is likely to occur."
2024-03-27,Wish granted (sort of) apple  posted a short behind the scenes video!
2024-03-27,Really like what you did with the lamp behind you.
2024-03-27,Bought an M1 MBP. Going to upgrade when the M5/M6 comes out
2024-03-27,I spent 11 minutes wondering if he was gonna fix that crooked lamp shade.
2024-03-27,You’re actually the goat in tech. It’s insane how far ahead you are
2024-03-27,"i really like this video more than the studio ones honestly idk why though
is it the way he speaks? is it the personal vlog direction? is it the honesty?"
2024-03-27,M3 is really just the high end model to make M1 cheaper and ween people off intel chips for good. Now everyone will pick up a M1/M2 MacBook
2024-03-27,"I'm still using the ole 15"" 2019 i9, 32gb ram. Thing is still just as fast as the day I opened the box. Use it for long hours of music production and let me tell you, those fans are constantly blazing. This thing is a tank."
2024-03-27,"Those who have nightmares about taking a black MacBook, now we can buy one directly from Apple..."
2024-03-27,"RE the magic keyboard and trackpad, I recently bought one of each and they are indeed USB-C. Both connectors"
2024-03-27,"Bruh, how do you have energy to do this, I'm simply amazed!"
2024-03-27,"The thing that you talk with honesty, is why I support you always. Thank you for your honesty"
2024-03-27,@10:00 Apple listened and posted the behind the scene for Shot by iPhone... the production is mega
2024-03-27,"It is not an interesting topic to me, but I appreciate you doing such a raw video, that is solely about your channels biggest strength, a in the end personal opinion of a well experienced and quite reflected tech user.
I hope this doesn´t sound condescending. I appreciate many of the ways you bring towards your work, only sometimes the polishedness or titles of the videos might direct away from the essence, that´s why this was in a good way surprising to me, that you see this as valid of a video as the high effort productions."
2024-06-30,"I had to buy one!!!  My MAC was fro 2013.  I was NOT impressed with the color but I tried it out in the store and well, bought it.  I guess I'll be one of those people that will be wowed with my new laptop.  I came to this video before I bought it.  :)   It took me like 6 months to go ahead and buy but here I am.  I'll definitely be watching this channel more and more."
2024-03-27,We would love to see a Studio reaction analyzing the BTS Apple Keynote Shot on iPhone. Or as part of the next waveform podcast
2024-03-27,"Great impromptu video Marques. I agree, if your present Mac is working for you there is no need to upgrade, but if you have the opportunity to upgrade and ""future proof"" your Mac where it will surpass a great number of years might be worth it. Just a thought. I hope you did well with your tournament."
2024-03-27,Good luck in the tournament Marques! If I was a few years younger I would be there.. I love the sport!
2024-03-27,"I'm still running my imac 27"" from late 2014 and it's still going strong still running illustrator, Photoshop and cinema4d    very well for my needs."
2024-03-27,"Sad to see the best value lower end MacBook go.
That was the 13 inch with touch bar which easily was a much better buy that the MacBook airs."
2024-03-27,So of course you watched the apple event so did you noticed the glass/mirror railing information in the right side at 5:10  I am exited to know you’re thought on that
2024-03-27,I am genuinely shocked that the whole presentation was shot on a iPhone 15 Pro
2024-03-27,Apple just released behind the scenes iPhone shoot
2024-03-27,"last week I picked up the Macbook Pro 14"" M3 Pro 18GB RAM and 512GB SSD. I am upgrading from my Macbook pro early 2015 that I have just sold for €300 to off set the €2400 sting I am still. 

I am just happy it has gone back to Magsafe, HDMI and a card reader without needing a dongle's like my 2020 Work Touchbar Macbook Pro which I hate with a passion because .....

the Display is stunning the performance is nuts, but I have been testing things and my 2013 trash can Mac Pro is still able to trade blows in rendering performance and that Mac Pro only cost me €600 second hand personally I am not entirely happy with that out come. 

I will be keep the MBP M3 Pro for a while so fingers crossed it lasts as long as my 2015"
2024-03-27,"Three reasons I‘m not getting an M3 MacBook Pro:
• Only 8 GB of RAM for the base model (non-upgradeable).
• You can only hook up one external monitor to it (need an M3 Pro or M3 Max for more displays).
• They‘re selling the base model at 1,999 € in Europe.

Sorry, I‘m out."
2024-03-27,Good luck on that tournament! Looks like a very fun competition
2024-03-27,"The internet connection as your biggest obstacle.. makes me wonder, what speed you do get?"
2024-03-27,Congrats on playing with the team! Hope you guys crush it!!!!!
2024-03-27,"I've got the 16"" MBP M3. It's true, no fingerprints. It's awesome"
2024-03-27,"I have an Intel Mac now, downgraded from a Pro to an Air, and think I'll be upgrading to the 14"" Pro. Was surprised that the accessories didn't get USB-C, hopefully they upgrade the mouse to have a charging port that doesn't render it useless when it needs to charge."
2024-03-27,Seeing Marques use the Arc browser is pretty cool imo
2024-03-27,"I have the M1 Mac mini with 16 gigs of RAM. As a professional photographer it is still working just fine with Lightroom and Photoshop. I don’t use layers in Photoshop so it’s not fogging down my computer. I also have it set up with dual monitors and connected four printers, microphone, external hard drive, and speakers all connected to thunderbolt for docking station. And the M1 Mac mini handles everything great I’m really impressed with it. I am starting to get into video editing so I plan on getting the max studio but I’m wondering if I should wait to see if they come out with an M3 max studio or just get the M2 with the ultra"
2024-03-27,That space black mbp is right up my alley
2024-03-27,"Still using MacBook Air intel 2020. Works like a charm, why should I change, I kept my previous MacBook for almost 10 years"
2024-03-27,"Marques's obsession of matte black continuous, but this MacBook black is beautiful"
2024-03-27,I don’t think HSBC’s trackpad and keyboard will come soon 8:35 Apple still needs to clear out all those lightning cables before discontinuing it… then there are all those partners contracts that haven’t lapsed yet. It’s all about the benjamins
2024-03-27,"ive been working on a late 2013 macbook pro since it came out, im so juiced to get one of these new ones. This bad boy is still kicking to this day, but it is quite tired, and has a hard time keeping up with all the newest software. Cant wait!"
2024-03-27,The thirst for that Matte Black MBP is real.
2024-03-27,"Im still using the M1 from the MacBook pro, dont see myself upgrading as its still really really fast. It uses the touchbar which I still love. Ill try to stay on this MacBook for as long as possible"
2024-03-27,black color is pure love
2024-03-27,"My m1 is so good that I think I'll be using it at minimum 3 years from now, and at maximum five years, it is way more than enough for what I do on a laptop."
2024-03-27,"@MKBHD you knew that a behind the scenes video is gonna come !!
Woah you said it , they delivered !"
2024-03-27,Just preordered a new MacBook when I just purchased A 1TB in 2022. M1 Pro to M3 PRO LETS GOOOOOOOO. Gotta upgrade the laptop when downgrading to a dumb phone (Light phone II). Especially after just getting an 15 pro too
2024-03-27,"been thinking about getting the M2 waiting a bit, glad i did so now i'll get the m3 currently still on a 2015 macbook pro"
2024-03-27,"i just bought a 2020 macbook air m1, basic model, with an external ssd of 1TB and fast reading 

it doesn’t even get hot!! like i’m baffled because my husband has a big ass dell for the SAME PRICE i paid for the macbook + ssd and it goes so hot you can barely hold it

i think m3 may make sense for specific companies, but the most amazing thing as a windows user has been the change of pace

that’s where apple has been shining for me: they are starting to finally have something that’s way better than windows for almost the same amount of money (depending on which windows notebook you were going to get)

idk, pretty solid, have been loving it, will def upgrade once i think it’s worth it again"
2024-03-27,Coming from an early 2015 MacBook Pro so very excited to be upgrading finally
2024-03-27,Marques is so humble.  He can obviously afford the latest and greatest but he doesn't.  Well done for being so grounded.
2024-03-27,0:28 Mixed (Race) Team USA?
2024-03-27,"I have a 2017 Macbook Pro, Intel Icore 5 with 16 gigabytes of RAM. And the Macbook gets HOT fast and always hear the fan blowing at full speed. Can't even handle YouTube with crashing. I definitely need an upgrade."
2024-03-27,Congrats on your performance Marques! Make the US proud!
2024-03-27,"You missed the point that was mentioned couple of times- upgrading from Intel-based Mac, there are plenty of people using them and it may be a right time to finally upgrade to M family."
2024-03-27,"I used to do a bit of light editing on my Macbook, well it's an early 2016 Macbook Pro and it uhh... yeah I could use a new one but it's wonderful that this one is still chugging along"
2024-03-27,“So I’ve been DNA Sequencing for the past two weeks now”
2024-03-27,dude im loving these new style phone recorded videos
2024-03-27,I'll wait for the reviews of the new M3 Macs rather than relying on Apple's own benchmarks
2024-03-27,"Thanks MKBHD for an amazing video as always and man, “All the Best” for your frisbee match!!!"
2024-03-27,"I’ve got at the moment MacBook Pro 16in intel i9 2019, I’m doing most graphic design and my Mac is getting slow, is it worth it to upgrade mine to m3? Any suggestions would be appreciated"
2024-03-27,Also liked the final note about the battery still running!
2024-03-27,Can't wait for your new video about the M3 family!
2024-06-30,"the really impressive part is the fact that we can get this kind of 128gb, high core count, high output computing in a super portable package for (comparatively) cheap, with which a little $20,000 mac pro from a few years ago wouldnt be able to compete"
2024-03-27,That “arc” is called the “hype cycle”
2024-03-27,Im still on my MacBook Air M1 basic specs and is killing it after all these years
2024-03-27,"Hey Marques just as you requested, the behind the scenes video is out.... u really have much influence i should say"
2024-03-27,Another important thing is there is a mac book pro with the regular M3 starting at $1600 instead of last year when the Macbook pro only got the M2 pro and max @ $2000+.
2024-03-27,"Genetics researcher here. That DNA sequencing implementation they showed is usually performed with  Nvidia GPUs, either on PCs or servers, since the software is designed to use CUDA. It is nice to see it work well with a macbook, but we will have to see what how does the performance and cost compare to PC."
2024-03-27,"The smoothcam effect is way overcooked, background is making me seasick"
2024-03-27,It’s kinda funny how the new iPhone color is the silver we all have on our Mac’s and then the new Mac color is the black we all have on our iPhones lol
2024-03-27,Please fix that lamp shade!! Driving my ocd nuts.
2024-03-27,"This man is a 6' 3"" pro athlete that makes time to review MacBooks while in an international tournament. The man is a helluva hard worker. And the M3 seems pretty OK. Good for Apple....."
2024-03-27,I am intrigued to see how many of these i spot in lectures after the christmas break
2024-03-27,good luck on the game!!! :)
2024-03-27,just received my M3 macbook Pro 16 GB 512 SSD.  Apple certified refurbished for $ 1376 !!! (military veterans discount)
2024-03-27,Professional photography/videography ALWAYS plays to the strengths of the camera.
2024-03-27,The problem is Tech companies churn out new stuff so fast  not much better than the previous generation and it's  very expensive .
2024-03-27,Congratulations on the bronze medal! Nothing like representing Team USA (I've competed at World Masters Athletics Championships and it was a thrill and an honor)
2024-03-27,There is now an M3? I just got M2
2024-03-27,Congrats on the being selected for the team.
2024-03-27,Congrats on making the team brother!!
2024-03-27,I love that the only reason to MKBHD for an upgrade will be the for the color Matte black
2024-03-27,When I got my first MacBook Pro I kept it for nearly 10 years.  I just got a M1 MacBook Pro like 2 years ago.  I'll say have at least 5 years until I'm going to start looking to upgrade again.
2024-03-27,"If you want a better option than the magic keyboard with the old connectors, I just upgraded from an old Surface Book, and the Bluetooth Microsoft Surface keyboard works perfectly and connects without issues, plus it takes AAA batteries which last for months, so I just have rechargeables and keep a spare charged set. The windows key auto-maps to the options key. I honestly think it's a better product, plus the Bluetooth Surface Mouse works perfectly as well and also has very long lasting (months) AAA batteries, so consider that as an option."
2024-03-27,"I recently bought an Asus Zenbook Duo which is a dual screen laptop. I had no idea how much I'd use the second screen but I use it nearly each time I'm on the computer. So many cool features. Very fast and does everything I need. I just which Apple would come out with something - anything that is super creative and innovative and makes us go ""wow""!"
2024-03-27,Love all the videos. But. I love the simplicity/format of this one
2024-03-27,"I hope your MBP review includes directly comparing the M2 Pro and M3 Pro, because the latter having less P-cores (6P+6E instead of 8P+4E) and lower memory bandwidth makes that upgrade feel even less meaningful than the others (which already feel pretty underwhelming)."
2024-03-27,Crazy how MKBHD thought a behind the scenes video for Apple's event will be interesting and Apple just like lauched it right after he said that.
2024-03-27,This might be the one time that I see an MKBHD video probably filmed on an iPhone.
2024-03-27,What do you shoot with when on the go? Your footage is always crispy and on point.
2024-03-27,Damn I’m here using a 2009 MacBook Air
2024-03-27,"Thanks for this vid, I’m still using my 2013 MacBook Pro, and it still works beautifully, but unfortunately it does not support new updates anymore and that wasn’t a problem for me until the adobe software stoped updating along with it. My current workflow works with my 2019 iPad and my 2013 MacBook Pro, I cannot use side-cart, but third party apps do work to do the same thing. I can still use Kritta, and other design applications though. I’m going to have to upgrade eventually… and you are my go-to person for these reviews. You are appreciated. I definitely got great use out of my 2013 MacBook Pro. I hope the next MacBook I get lasts ten years as well…."
2024-03-27,The super cool NEW MacBook Pro. It’s almost exactly the same as the super cool OLD MacBook Pro. M2 has aged wonderfully! we don’t really need the new one. Even the M1 has aged wonderfully!
2024-03-27,Good luck on the tournament bro
2024-03-27,i’m not even a tech guy honestly but i work at a place that has all the new apple products and that space black on a mac book is clean asf
2024-03-27,That's awesome that you are competing with team USA! Best of luck to you and the team. Cheers.
2024-03-27,I would say that the October Scary Fast event is just a flex of how well the iPhone 15 Pro's camera performs in low light. The event takes place at night and we all know that phone cameras suck without enough light. It is not the best thing ever but it is acceptable.
2024-03-27,"Nice cameo from Tim there, good collab!"
2024-03-27,I aspire to have this level of precision in my communication skill
2024-03-27,"I'm using a 16"" M2 Pro MacBook Pro and it's already so incredibly fast that I don't think upgrading to an M3 Max right now is a practical thing to do... well, for me. But if you work in the engineering, graphic design, animation, or architectural field or if you just love new things and have loads of budget for that, then, by all means, treat yourself."
2024-03-27,"seriously tempted to trade in my newly purchased MacBook Pro w/ M2 Pro just for that black color, its so damn sexy"
2024-03-27,You know they made that matte black MBP just for you right... ?
2024-03-27,I hope you do really well in this competition team USA. I’ll be praying for you.
2024-03-27,"I wil be keeping my macbook pro m1 16'' base model for the next couple of years, perfectly happy with it."
2024-03-27,I'm still using an intel macbook pro. 2019 to be exact. I definitley think it's time to upgrade to an M3 Macbook pro.
2024-03-27,"Video production editing on my base M1 Mac Mini with 16GB ram 

Literally still a cracking machine dealing with 4k 6k files 

A M3 on the next gen IPad is the ones to watch especially with Final Cut and Davincy"
2024-03-27,"I love the fact that even Marquees says “I don’t need it, I don’t max out my M1”
But people seem to think they always need the latest and greatest"
2024-03-27,Congrats on the team!!
2024-03-27,Good luck in the competition
2024-03-27,This video is awesome. Reminds me of the old days in the dorm.
2024-03-27,Still have the M1 from 3 years ago and still so good for me
2024-03-27,"You asked for it, Marques ! Apple just released the Behind the Scenes!"
2024-03-27,As someone who casually watches tech and works retail it’s honestly crazy to me that people buy these machines to actually use it- but not only that but also that whatever job doesn’t provide it for you already
2024-03-27,"I’m a bit confused about the strategy here. I’ve bought my M2 max 6 months ago right after its release (it was february I guess). And we see another upgrade within 6-7 months. I love mine and have no intention to upgrade anytime soon but I’d like to have the latest tech for at least a year man, upgrading product specs in 6 months is cruel."
2024-03-27,NGL fully expected your video to fade to black and say “shot on iPhone - edited on Mac”
2024-03-27,Congratulations with the LT-opportunity Marques
2024-03-27,"Does he actually know that Intel is faster than Apple again, and that Apple went to ARM at the worst moment, right before Intel launched their 12th gen with hybrid core architecture?"
2024-03-27,The setup looks like he is about to threaten batman to reveal his identity
2024-03-27,All the best for your championship Marques
2024-03-27,"Hey Marques, love the video and the information you provided! I wanted to point out that in your talking head video there was a bit of wobbling affect going on in the background. not sure if this was due to some type of rolling shutter from the canon r5, the lens' distortion, or the warp stabilizer added in post?
Thanks for the amazing content as usual!"
2024-03-27,Congrats on achieving the goal of being on Team USA! Super happy for you man! Good luck to you and the team!
2024-03-27,"Cant believe @mkbhd is forgetting one big upgrade, that is the M3 now finally does support AV1 en/decoding."
2024-07-30,I was one of the ones pushing my m1 pro to the limit. I see a night and day difference with the m3 pro.

2024-03-27,Fantastic as always Marques!
2024-03-27,"If you wanna bring the Apple Silicon and especially the Max variant to its knees, use noise reduction in davinci resolve"
2024-03-27,"Exactly my own thoughts on recent announcements. I switched from MacBook Pro's to a Midnight M2 Air 16/512GB last year and I'm amazed at what it will do. General business use, browsing, a few games, some editing of 4K iPhone and 5.1K drone footage it does it all in a small light package with no moving parts. I don't think I even need a MacBook Pro anymore. I've been able to keep my Mac machines for far longer and speed has outpaced most software requirements recently, which is great for us users but not so great for Apple's sales. I do like that black though..."
2024-03-27,I just pre-ordered mine today and I can’t wait for it to arrive
2024-03-27,They’ve uploaded the BTS for the Shot on iPhone now on their channel.
2024-03-27,"@mkbhd You probably already seen it by now, but there’s a ‘shot on iPhone’ behind the scenes online. Impressive rigs all fitted with iPhone, but there’s so much tech and light around the phone, no normal person is ever going to get to experience the same quality end result at home. But it’s mighty impressive that a phone can give you the idea it’s shot on a Red or Arri, that much I have to say."
2024-03-27,Congratulations on the team.
2024-03-27,So the shot on iPhone thing. Yes it was they used Blackmagic cam app with iPhone 15 pro and pro res. They have a 2min video on the behind the scenes. Pretty cool.
2024-03-27,I LOVE the vlog style !!!
2024-03-27,Extremely Awesome Content as always by the Legendary Legend that is MKBHD.......
2024-03-27,07:16 caught me completely off guard hahahahahahahah are you reviewing the new m3 macbook air ?
2024-03-27,Wow! Team USA! That is amazing! Congrats to you brother! I’ve been on the OG M1 MacBook Pro since it was released. I am excited for that space black!
2024-03-27,There's also two different variations of the M3 Max and the more premium version is actually twice as fast as m1 max..!
2024-03-27,"I got a macbook air m2 2023 and I do all kinds of CGI, working with blender, Adobe etc, and it basically is just instant in everything that I do. It’s hard for Apple do make things better than instant"
2024-03-27,"The pun to Samsung in the ~You think it’s hard work?~ video “not a fan of the Galaxy… hehehe”, is supreeeeeme"
2024-03-27,Apple just changed its name from Air to pro on 14 inch M3 laptop to sell it for a higher price. What a shame!
2024-03-27,A custom top spec gaming PC and a M1 Pro as a sidearm is still my go to
2024-03-27,"17.8 M  watchers..wow keep growing brother, inspiring stuff"
2024-03-27,It’s amazing that the event was shot in iPhone 15 Pro Max but they used an industrial Hollywood gimbal
2024-03-27,It’s always render times and workflow resolutions and these recent years machine learning. Used to be all hard wired into a wall and desk but now these work flows are truly mobile and that’s exciting for anyone even if you have a render network farm onsite.
2024-03-27,So I was on a site trying to decide WHICH new MAC I need to buy and I had to stop and come see what YOU had to say about it.  I'm Spongebob!  LOL
2024-03-27,"Marques never misses, great video!"
2024-03-27,Marques secretly loves video production more than the actual tech
2024-03-27,Still using my maxed out M1 as well. Still fast. Still satisfying.
2024-03-27,MKBHD asks for a behind the scenes and apple responds
2024-03-27,Apple released behind the scenes for this production btw!
2024-03-27,Amazing but a bad news for M1 Max users I am an architect using M1 Max because of Unreal engine s new technologies and stuff …I was waiting for Unreal to work perfectly in Mac they bring support for lumen I was like yes we will get nanite and pathtracer soon but they bring M2 and add support for nanite  it mean that now they forget m1 macs the prouf is as you can se they bring M3 and then say it will support ray tracing they will forget m2 as soon as they forget M1 Max I really regret getting M1 Max Mac.
2024-03-27,"I have an m2 MacBook. And seriously. I will never ever use another laptop in my life. Apple MacBooks are the best laptops you can get. Reliable, simple and smooth. Such a quality product. Last donkey of years !Don’t know why I didn’t buy one years ago !"
2024-03-27,"They have made a device that doesn't need switching for atleast 4 years, I have an M2 Air and all my my collegemates have the M1 air, and those machines are not slowing down, I don't think they'll switch to anything new from apple anytime soon. People will switch to M3 from windows after the m3 airs launch."
2024-03-27,All the best with that tournament ️ bring the Gold back 🫡
2024-03-27,"Lets be clear, that is the absolute best Spongebob episode ever."
2024-03-27,My M1 does break a sweat. I really want to know who these people are that are able to Max the M1 out! Like what are they running?
2024-03-27,"I recently “upgraded” from an egpu rig with a Radeon 6800 to an m3 setup. The older egpu rig looked AMAZING, but it lacked processing power. 

I now have the processing power, but I also have noticeably subpar graphics quality. I’ve got the same monitor (lg 38” qhd) and similar gpu specs, but no matter which settings I try, I can’t come close to the egpu’s picture quality. 


I wonder if the m3 graphics processor would work better with a retina style external monitor, but it seems like a big financial gamble. I just don’t know if it will solve the quality issue. 

I feel like I’m in an upgrade limbo where each improvement is also a downgrade. It’s extremely disappointing. We need better external monitor support, or support egpu’s again."
2024-03-27,"its almost 2024 and if i cant render a full heavy 5 min 3d animation video in 3 minutes, and doesnt even warm up, i dont want anything"
2024-07-30,"Not very happy!  My new MacBook Pro 16 apparently has some kind of crack on the front left edges of the main structure, where the top surface meet the front side  Apple manager dismissed the issue, said it’s just cosmetic or superficial, normal wear and tear…if i magnify it ..I clearly see a separation…..Are there similar experiences? I wish I can show you guys a photo…"
2024-03-27,First they quote you in their last keynote and now they make a matte black MBP. It almost feels like they made this just for you.
2024-03-27,"Congratulations on your selection to the USA National Team!  Now that you have your flat black computer (if you choose to purchase one), can you please hound Apple to release a 27"" 5K MINI-LED replacement for the Studio Display?  It is what they should have released in the first place.  The performance on offer doesn't justify the price they are asking for the current Studio Display."
2024-03-27,MKBHD Pro Max. Did a super video sitting in a hotel room.
2024-03-27,"I think, they want more for people who have intel mac to update. Like people who buy an intel mac just before M1 release, they talk about that like 2 times in the event."
2024-03-27,I was waiting for the impression on the production
2024-03-27,"Your dream came true, apple made a behind the scenes video on their channel"
2024-03-27,"On a daily basis, are you using a 14 inch or 16-inch display  M1 Max Macbook Pro yourself?"
2024-03-27,The black is goign to scratch like CRAZY!!
2024-03-27,"Im having the ""I dont need it"" mantra going on in my head about upgrading my 4090 to the 5090 when it comes out in 2025.

Im waiting for the 6090"
2024-03-27,"Mkbhd:  Amazing production  

Trillion dollar company:  blushing ohh staap it️"
2024-03-27,very nice video on this topic. I wait for in new your video. Thanks
2024-03-27,The Qualcomm chip came from an company they bought. Looks a little better than M3 but they both are in a class of there own.
2024-03-27,"They’ve published a BTS video. It truly was shot on iPhone, they had a whole rig to stabilize and move it to get those cinematic shots in. Mind blown by how good it all looks"
2024-03-27,"I still use iMac 5K 2017, With new interest in 3D animation I think it's time for me to upgrade to M3"
2024-03-27,"You asked for BTS, you got BTS from Apple  Apple watches your channel!"
2024-03-27,Best of luck to you and your team
2024-03-27,I'm still using the M1 MacBook Pro still performs superb.
2024-03-27,"Estaba buscando información sobre la MacBook M3 y encontré este video, muchas gracias por esta información, me parece muy interesante todo el análisis que realizas. Saludos."
2024-03-27,"Great discussion, and great job making the team.  Now go out and kick some Ultimate butt!"
2024-03-27,Would love to see a comparison between the M2 MacBook Air 15-inch and the M3 base-model 14-inch MacBook Pro.
2024-03-27,I'm still using M1 Max MBP and see no need to upgrade. I think considerable display technology improvements are the only thing that will draw me to upgrade before the 3ish year from now mark.
2024-03-27,lightening keybaord and trackpad is wild
2024-03-27,love this guy
2024-03-27,I could see your excitement when you talked about the color LOL!! Great videos.. Keep up the good work! Matte black all day!
2024-03-27,That Windows wallpaper made me smile. Good luck with the game!
2024-03-27,"Don't even try to resist, you already know you're going to get that matte black M3 MacBook, Marques :) Go Team USA!!"
2024-03-27,The point at which shot on an iPhone sounds unbelievable
2024-03-27,Marques what is this thumbnail
2024-03-27,"Space black ""I don't need it"" got me! RELATABLE"
2024-03-27,I think no one needs a car as fast as Bugatti but they still make it even faster over time.
2024-03-27,Congrats Marques!
2024-03-27,Thanks for another quality presentation my dude!
2024-03-27,"Lol, I just watched a six year-old iJustine video unboxing a black kitchenaid, limited edition, mixer where she talks about your obsession with all things matte black.  Then I see this video."
2024-03-27,Shot on iPhone doesn’t mean Audio captured via iPhone. But still impressive.
2024-03-27,"@marques I thought something that stood out, that was missing from prvious events, was the comparison to the old Intel models. They were really going after those people to say ""look how much better this will be, if you're still on the old tech"""
2024-03-27,"I bought a 14"" MBP M2 Max with 32GB RAM last June. I'll wait til the M5."
2024-03-27,"Also what's with the hate on the M1 MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar? I have it, and I love it! I always get people saying, ""Whoa! your MacBook has a Touch Bar? That's insane!"""
2024-03-27,Congrats on the achievement man!
2024-03-27,You should Switch your r5 for an a7s3… This canon woobles are horrible
2024-03-27,Future video title for MKBHD/The Studio in September 2024: Behind the Scenes of an Apple Keynote event
2024-03-27,I have a 16 m1 max macbook and i am happy i am waiting til apple announces a completely new macbook pro
2024-03-27,17.8 Million viewers of the event knew exactly who that Ma..SPACE Black version is made for. Go USA!
2024-03-27,So MKBHD uses Arc as his main browser now? That's nice to know.
2024-03-27,I have AirPod Pros 2nd gen that u bought when they were released in Germany. Few days ago I bought them again as a gift for my gf and she asked me why there was no power brick and I told her that’s Normal now. I said she can use her iPhone charger but it didn’t fit. Then I noticed that apple quietly changed them to USB c too
2024-03-27,bro i JUST knew you were going to talk about that matte black LOL bro i love your content
2024-03-27,As a 3d modeller who works with 3d and textures I am gonna buy it for sure
2024-03-27,its like when they came out with pink iPhone and Justine was in the same boat
2024-03-27,Looking forward to the review bro ️
2024-03-27,My macbook pro is the first retina from 2012… so it’s a good upgrade for me
2024-03-27,Marques is in love Space Black
2024-03-27,"I really miss the old 13,15 and 17 inch sizes, they should bring those back!"
2024-03-27,"Wait, they say ""Y'all"" in New Jersey?  :)

I went from a 2010 13"" MacBook Pro that I liked to a 2020 M1 13"" MacBook Pro that I really like.  The battery life is still amazing and it works great.  It's hard to justify upgrading when these devices cost over $1,000.  But the M3 MacBook has sparked my interest, even though I'm not happy that they got rid of the 13"" MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar.  I love that form factor and the Touch Bar!"
2024-03-27,"I bought an Asus transformer in 2015 for $600, that think always did the job (heavy office work ie spreadsheets) on the fifth year battery started to lose capacity but nothing to cry about, on the day I was getting a new one the hinge mechanism broke, my bad, point is, I believe that thing would still be running on work level today, imagine and M1 MacBook that thing can last you a decade easy."
2024-03-27,Way to go on being picked for team USA! Good luck in the tourney!
2024-03-27,I'm headed to Huntington Beach tomorrow for sure. I grew up in Orange County and had no idea about this world event. I just emailed the WUBC office about vending and event sponsorship. Team USA
2024-03-27,"They abandoned the 27"" iMac too. I was hoping they would go larger rather than going smaller. 30"" iMacs would be worth it to me."
2024-03-27,"I currently have the M1 Pro 14"" MacBook Pro and its still plenty fast for my needs. I dont see myself upgrading anytime soon until maybe the M6 gen processors"
2024-03-27,"After owning the 14in MBP for a while, I have never once felt that my laptop was slow in any regard, and 90% of the time preferred the experience over my gaming PC with an i7 and RTX GPU. These machines are incredible, and still outclass most laptops on the market"
2024-03-27,"i skipped m1 and m2, although it nearly killed me to do so when i saw the performance benefits over the last-gen intel macs. however my 16 intel mac is now 3-4 years old, and i'm happy to adopt m3 now that apple silicon is mature and 'bedded in'."
2024-03-27,"This event should’ve been a press release. I also won’t upgrade from my M1 Air until it can’t get software support anymore, likely in the early 2030’s"
2024-03-27,My M1 stuff is so good I dont see a need to upgrade anything.   Even the iPad Air with the M1 chip is amazing.   I video edit on it and it handles it with ease using all the files from an SSD so it uses little space on the actual iPad
2024-03-27,Can you make a video about how apple incorporates so many ads and product placements into their announcements now? They hadn’t previously up until the last few years I think.
2024-03-27,Now when I have both macbook pro with touch bar vs the new without I miss the touch bar. I want both.
2024-03-27,Hey Marques. You have stopped posting tech regarding TV sets? I need to be updated on that bro
2024-03-27,"The same black finish, I just got a refurbished m2 MacBook Air in that finish lol"
2024-03-27,I should upgrade but I don't need to. I'm still using my 2011 15 inch MBP. I upgraded to a 1TB SSD and 16 GM of ram. I mainly use it for Final Draft and Scrivener.
2024-03-27,They did a behind the scenes!
2024-03-27,"Another category of people who can never get enough power from their machines are music producers. Complex DAW sessions always tax CPU, and there are limits to how much can be parallelised, meaning that single core performance will usually be the key bottleneck. And as performance does increase, plug-in manufacturers will usually find new ways to exploit that performance. So, serious producers will likely still be hungry for more performance from their machines for many years to come."
2024-03-27,They made a behind the scenes! Looks like they had some fancy rig to connect the phone to industry standard tools
2024-03-27,"The main reason for me to upgrade would be the fact that right now, I could still sell my M1 Max (16"", 64GB, 2TB) for good money (it's valued at 2650€). If I never do, there comes the day when my device is just too old and I'll be stuck with it (which is why I still own a Late 2013 15"" - I kept it too long to be able to sell it)."
2024-03-27,"Wild thought here… but I truly believe Apple listens to Marques’ recommendations. Like finally delivering a matte black MacBook.   He has been saying it for a while. And another part of the same wild thought is Marques being aware of his power, and low key making those suggestions. Lol."
2024-03-27,"it’s against TOS to have a sponsored video, that’s not said it’s sponsored"
2024-03-27,As usual  marvelous  video
2024-03-27,Proud of you for representing the country!
2024-03-27,"Why was my comment mentioning Ryan Kopinsky's channel deleted? Nobody can equal the number of Marques subs, so why?"
2024-03-27,"Amazing i like this format,no graphics  very casual and interesting"
2024-03-27,"Apple’s chips really weren’t the leap forward people say they were, here’s why:
1. Comparing to Intel chips it was a leap, but AMD was doing much better, especially in energy efficiency
2. The most cutting edge chips were still built on 7nm when M1 came out on 5nm. 
3. M1 integrated everything on the chip, which is a big reason for the efficiency improvement. 
It was a leap, but not because ARM or Apple doing something impossible. It was a leap because of 5nm and integrating everything on a single chip."
2024-03-27,My question was also how that masterpiece of an Apple event was shot on an iPhone!!!
2024-03-27,"I plan on keeping my M1 MacBook Air until it physically falls apart. I've never been so impressed by a laptop. The battery life and power combination are just unbeatable to me. I do know however, that when I eventually do upgrade, it's going to be huge."
2024-03-27,That matte black Mac looks awesome! I would get that one if I used a Mac and needed a new laptop.
2024-03-27,"@7:21 mkbhd had the apple fever....""i don't need it"""
2024-03-27,"The issue is that guys know about tech but not about Corporate Finance and business models.
Apple makes new gear... but they don't target M1 owners... They target competitors and older versions.

With Apple 15/14/13, I have an iPhone X I need to change. Well, I go with the 15... 
There are more older versions of people who get new jobs, make money, or simply change or need a new item.

That's why improvements are small..."
2024-03-27,Crooked lamp shade is driving me bananas
2024-03-27,Will these new laptops finally be 120hz refresh rate or will it still remain 60hz…
2024-03-27,M3 Pro really feels like a rebrand. I am a video editor and I got the M2 MacBook Air instead
2024-03-27,I have macboook pro 13 inch 2016 1 TB with 16 GB ram and its still works great!! Ill keep it till I apple do something completely different
2024-03-27,"I feel like one key point they really tried to make was kind of missing in this video. I feel like they are not pointing at people with M1’s or M2’s. They’re looking at everyone who has Intel based MacBooks, I think that’s the public that they want to push towards that upgrade."
2024-03-27,He is gonna get one for sure. It’s matte black !
2024-03-27,I legit had no idea ultimate frisbee was really a thing.
2024-03-27,"In 3 short generations of upgrades, we’ve gone from “I wish Apple would update this stuff” to “why does Apple keep upgrading this stuff?” lol"
2024-03-27,This thumbnail is.... Something else
2024-03-27,My M1 pro MacBook Pro does the job for me. And my desktop M1 max Mac studio is more than enough. No need to upgrade anytime soon.
2024-03-27,I got the 16 inch M2 that just came out earlier this year. I’m not happy about this!
2024-03-27,"Marques, please listen to the other audios you have, specially the Spanish one. 
I'll be glad to help you improve all kind of stuff like that in the Spanish language."
2024-03-27,"@7:43 With me, it is just the opposite, I would get the silver-like finish and KNOW that I have got this latest maxed-out beast for about 8.500 €… And once I happen to be rich enough (I am not ;-) I would get the Studio Display — and the colors would just match…"
2024-03-27,Love the ultimate frisbee shout out!
2024-03-27,"With how mature the consumer electronics market is becoming, specifically smartphones, tablets, and personal computers, I think the turn around time for new products needs to slow down. We don’t need a new iPhone every year anymore, we don’t need new Mac chips every 2-3 years anymore."
2024-03-27,"I have a 2012 MacBook that has finally reached its end of life, the pro is definitely the upgrade I’ll be getting"
2024-03-27,That lamp in the background drives me crazy
2024-03-27,"As an M1 Max user too there's no point, it's so good already and it was expensive. I'll wait until like M5. I'm hoping some more AAA games come out and that makes the upgrade worth it, as I'll never need more than the M1 Max for software engineering."
2024-03-27,Good luck in your ultimate frisbee competition.  That's awesome.
2024-03-27,"He’s not trying to convince himself to buy a new MacBook or fishing for a free one, but saying it out loud on camera."
2024-03-27,"My M2 Pro 1TB has been great. I honestly feel no need to upgrade, but that seems to be the story with laptops."
2024-03-27,can't wait for the iPad Pros with M3 chip just to play 2D games and watch YouTube
2024-03-27,"Bro, get that matte black, you deserve it ;)"
2024-03-27,"idk, coming from an M1 macbook pro, the M2 and M3 do not ""feel"" like an upgrade: no touch bar, more chunky design, i wouldnt trade it."
2024-03-27,"Btw, the whole reveal was shot on iphones. Pretty cool as long as you have an external storage to record the footages"
2024-03-27,Why is it so hard to get dual monitor support in the not most expensive macbooks???
2024-03-27,"If you don't video edit or game, a laptop from 2016 will still feel as fast. Computers, like cellphones, have plateaued. All this talk about nanometer chips or etc, is for a niche segment. Don't really think most people care"
2024-03-27,"Is it worth upgrading to this from a maxed out 15” M1 Max (64GB RAM, 4TB SSD) or not really?"
2024-03-27,"Marques, you played the SpongeBob episode where he eventually he fulfills his need...

so you need it."
2024-03-27,"I can't lie, that matte black aluminum is calling me..."
2024-03-27,"MAC back in black. Sometimes you got to get back the OG. Unfortunately, I keep mine in a hardshell case. So regardless it's color, no one will never see it."
2024-03-27,"What Space Black? Apple, call it MKBHD edition already!"
2024-03-27,I currently own a Mac Studio because I didn't want to spend 4000$ on a laptop to have it rigged to my screen on my desk 99% of the time. Now I'll be replacing my Mac Studio with a Macbook pro with m1 max bought used because the performance of that thing is still absolutely insane for what I do. Also the Mac Studio's value is still surprisingly good almost 2 years after it's release and the M3 release had an obvious effect on the used market of macbook pros.
2024-03-27,bro is a professional frisbee player wtf
2024-03-27,"Marquez, you’ll upgrade to M3 Max and you know it! Remember, your M1 Max doesn’t have HDMI 2.1 (it has 2.0) and WiFi 6E.
Shot on iPhone 15 Pro Max is impressive indeed. Many missed that detail."
2024-05-01,I'm considering a move to the Apple ecosystem by getting an iPhone 15 Pro Max and Macbook Pro. I'm appreciating your input.
2024-03-27,"Theres some kind of ""clever"" gimbal that's making this super wobbly"
2024-03-27,What camera are you using? It looks pretty cool
2024-03-27,I think it’s time for me to upgrade from my 2018 Intel now
2024-03-27,"Remember iPhone 7?
When Apple has no new ideas, they do colors."
2024-03-27,“Matte black” stares out window longingly …
2024-03-27,I love the black finish
2024-03-27,I appreciate the real talk.
2024-03-27,Black one would look sick if they still had the glowing Apple logos.
2024-03-27,"Hey dude I love your videos, but can you get your audio levels more to a pro level? I was washing dishes with both hands while listening to your video on AirPods Pro , then a Verizon ad interrupted you mid sentence,blasting and literally almost knocked me off my feet it was so loud.  I’m an editor, and have no problem getting my sister’s YouTube channel audio levels to a broadcast commercial level on YouTube.  Thanks and much love."
2024-03-27,Happy To See You !!!  love all about Apple iPhone iPad MacBook love  all of Apple Big Big ️ love you forever !
2024-03-27,"helo, 
first of all, All the best for your match. have your dream play especially representing your nation. Really proud moment, and I can understand how much important is that.
I am a fan of Apple, mac, iPad, etc. And to know, I get 100% satisfaction with your video.
great job...keep on going...
all the best.
and thank you."
2024-03-27,"So guys i upgrade my laptop every 5-6 years , latest one was HP on 2017 , should i get the m1 max now or the m3 pro ? Both are same price"
2024-03-27,"My guess is Apple has a lot of inventory of accessories with Lightning they want to sell off first - and then they’ll silently switch out to USB-C keyboards, trackpads and mice sometime next year."
2024-03-27,"I have the M2 Max Pro Macbook with 32GB Ram from work and my own personal M1 Pro Macbook. with 16GB Ram. Both are 16"". I work between them all the time and I can honestly say there’s no difference in performance. M1, M2, M3s etc. are just yearly marketing ploys to get us to keep buying. They are great products to have but one purchase should last you at least five years."
2024-03-27,The only reason I’m excited for the M3 Max is because I’m gonna buy an MBP M1 Max for a cheaper price! I’m coming from an old chunky Lenovo gaming laptop. I use it for video and photo editing and it’s just about to give out on me. So jumping to M1 will be a huge jump in performance for me. Also Cyber Monday is around the corner. Hopefully I can get on for under $2k.
2024-03-27,yo the new space black color its like razer 16 got an apple sticker in the back
2024-03-27,10:45 my jaw dropped… Stunning! Why can’t my video look like that? I have an iPhone
2024-03-27,"They seem like they know the M2 to M3 upgrade is not a big sell, so they're making the case for M1 and last gen intel mac users to get into M3 hardware."
2024-03-27,Loved the video
2024-03-27,"Glad to know, I wasn’t the only one having a SpongeBob moment when I saw the space black MacBooks

2024-03-27,I got a new Tag line for your cover photo in YouTube.. Powered by Apple.
2024-03-27,"Hello, Humans 
Never waste your time to think, because in 2023 thinking is rare.

TERRANCE OUT"
2024-03-27,"2:53: you're talking about being ""on the bleeding edge"" of trendy marketed tech, not about being on the bleeding edge of technology by itself (""new"" doesn't make something ""better""), especially when talking about Apple's captive microcosm. That said, your reviews are honest and I like that, thanks."
2024-03-27,Apple released a behind the scenes look at how the Apple Event was shot on the iPhone. Just putting it in the universe huh?
2024-03-27,You got what we all wanted Marques! A B.T.S. of the Apple event!!
2024-03-27,"The thing that makes Apple Silicon so great is Rosetta 2.  Had they flubbed that, this transition would've been horrible!  But Rosetta 2 performed damn near flawlessly from day 1.

I'll admit, when I first heard about Apple Silicon, I was extremely skeptical.  I definitely figured this would be a ""wait until the 2nd or 3rd generation before you buy it"" kind of thing, figuring there'd be  too many bugs that needed to be worked out.  But, DAMN!  Apple knocked it out of the park!!  I bought an M1 Mac Mini a couple of months after it was released, and I never looked back!  Currently I'm on an M2 Pro MacBook Pro.  Doubt I'll upgrade to the M3 anytime soon -- this M2 Pro chip is perfectly fine, and the M3 Pro isn't all  much of an upgrade.  But in 3 years?  I'm sure I'll upgrade to the M4 Pro or M5 Pro or whatever chip is the latest and greatest Pro chip at the time.

Well done, Apple!"
2024-03-27,I got M1 and its amazing. Only reason I might change is the size and could love a little smaller but not a deal breaker
2024-03-27,"i'm still using my 15in macbook pro from 2013, which I just partially broke the screen of so I'm thinking this may be the year i finally upgrade"
2024-03-27,"Hey guys is it just me or apple just teased applecar in the October event at 24:52?? was I the only one to spot this? look até the right side of the MacBook Pro, it appears for a brief of a second."
2024-03-27,I really wish they’d start offering a 27” iMac again.
2024-03-27,Who else thinks releasing new devices every year is irrelevant at this point.
2024-03-27,I can’t help but think that the comparison between M1 and M3 is targeted at M1 users and below because they know that very few people with an M2 would even consider upgrading.
2024-03-27,"I'm wondering if a M1 or M2 MacBook Pro would be a better choice than M3 MacBook Pro for photography edits, editing videos, web and app development... 
M3 may be the fastest one but as M1 and M2 devices are less expensive, it might be the right time to have a MacBook dedicated for some specific projects"
2024-03-27,Apple actually released behind the scenes video!
2024-03-27,"I’ve got my MacBook Air, and it’s been rock-solid for my student workload—no complaints. Considering an upgrade for a larger size, but that’s not happening anytime soon. Maybe in 3 to 4 years, aiming for the M6 or M7 MacBook Pro, lol."
2024-03-27,they actually did the behind the scenes video.
2024-03-27,Do you pick hotels with large windows for good light in case you need to film a random Apple event?
2024-03-27,That’s my bestie on the thumbnail for apple!
2024-03-27,"SAME THING! I TOT THEY EDITED THE EVENT SCENES ON CAMERA. BUT NO, THEY RE FROM IPHONE 15 PROMAX AND EDITED ON MAC. WOW"
2024-03-27,Congrata Marques
2024-03-27,We're using M1's at my company and there's absolutely no need to upgrade to M3's. I believe it's a cash grab for people who just need the new Apple product every year. I'm an IT Support Specialist
2024-03-27,"Apple: We have the new M3 chip
MKBHD: Nah, my M1 is still good
Apple: We have the new black color
MKBHD: Time to upgrade!"
2024-03-27,8:51 is Apple now hiding the notch as well?
2024-03-27,So it will be interesting to see if Apple puts this high-performance & long battery life M3 chip into the Apple Vision when it comes out next year. And offer a Space Black option too.
2024-03-27,Apple indeed released a short behind the scenes video
2024-03-27,Yeah this is totally irrelevant but I couldn't help but notice the obvious wobbly effect of the camera's IBIS lol. Was the only thing my eyes looked at for the whole vid  Great video tho!

2024-03-27,"I was waiting for this M3 to upgrade from MacBook Pro I5 (2017), I think will be a good upgrade ^^"
2024-03-27,They should bring back Touch Bar & allow option for people that want it
2024-03-27,"Sure comparing to last year’s model is neat and all, but comparing to a 3-4 year old model is probably more valuable for most consumers, since most do not upgrade every year or even every other year, so a comparison between the new model and another model multiple generations newer than the model they currently own is not very useful at all. Though having both would obviously be best.

This goes for phones, pc’s, Mac’s, and most things in general that get an update yearly"
2024-03-27,It's interesting seeing a windows logo as the wallpaper on your macbook
2024-03-27,The only thing that can push my M1 Pro is crystallography computations. Browsing the web and using Microsoft office you'll feel like the M1 processors still move at ludicrous speed.
2024-03-27,Raised prices by over 10% again here in AU - it's really getting unaffordable
2024-03-27,"Why haven't you uploaded a review yet? So many ppl did yesterday, there's no way Apple didn't give you one early"
2024-03-27,I think the reason why they keep comparing M3 to M1 is because they want M1 users and Intel Mac users especially to upgrade now. And they want them to upgrade straight to M3. They don't want you to look at M2.
2024-03-27,"So are the Mac Silicon Macbooks not going to kill the battery within a year and heat up to the temperature of the sun by simply using the browser, to the point where the fan kicks on and my computer sounds like Hurricane Katrina blowing through?

... Because that's what every previous MacBook I've owned has done."
2024-03-27,"The M1 family was Apple's AMD Zen moment. That first massive leap forward to the technological standard of the day is a one time thing, with the usual +10-20% yearly improvements being inevitable going forward after that, like every other major silicon designer.  I really don't know why people thought Apple was going to be able to produce M1 level gains each generation. That was an idiotic assumption."
2024-03-27,"Soon as that notch goes I'm getting one, until then its thinkpads"
2024-03-27,"I just paid $4K for my MacBook Pro M2 Max in April, only for a M3 Max in October- why?!"
2024-03-27,"Using a mid 2014 MB Pro and planning to upgrade to a M1 Chip. Should I wait and see the M3 performance against the M1 & M2? Doing a light photo and video edit, nothing huge. 
If the performance isn't that big of a difference, should I wait and hope the older M chips come down on price a lot, when the M3 hits the market? 
I'm not a person, who change a computer every year and need a topnotch every time, so with this decision, I need to future proof myself a bit as well :D"
2024-03-27,Congratulations
2024-03-27,Great thoughts!
2024-03-27,"Repeat after me (or Sponge Bob), Marques...I don't need it, I don't need it, I definitely don't need it!  07:19  You know you can probably just call that old guy with the white hair. Oh, if you do get behind the scenes footage using an iPhone for the videography then definitely share it, please!  And how much post production editing did they do to get that look??!!"
2024-05-01,He hasn’t started with the MKBHD here intro since this video ):
2024-03-27,If you are a 3d modeler/animator/developer or do anything involving virtual production using Unreal Engine then the fact that Macs finally support hardware accelerated raytracing was the headline of the show along with their new gpu architecture and dynamic caching system. This announcement very much felt targeted toward PC users that are 3D professionals and have been hesitient to switch to Mac due to lack of support for hardware accelerated raytracing and less about convincing M1 users to upgrade to M3. With the rise in virtual production across big studios and networks it makes sense for Apple to re eastablish themselves as a players in the 3D professional creative space. All highlighted when considering Nvidia's recent announcement of entering the CPU sphere and the latest advancements by Qualcomm.
2024-03-27,"One of the primary functions I just assumed the M1 and M2 would have is the ability to support multiple external displays as well as power multiple external drives via bus; I falsely assumed. 
The biggest upgrade aside from the obvious, IMO, are those new feature sets. It may seem trite but being sold so heavily on Thunderbolt (USB-C) throughput and then not getting it was a major bummer and I'm so happy to see these new M3's can do those simple tasks. I'm currently on the M1 MBP with 8 cores of CPU, 8 cores of GPU and 16gb of RAM, though for those specs the computer is very solid it's just not quite enough juice for my professional needs and workflow, the M3 is the answer I was looking for; especially the Max. Also LOOOOVE that they added an additional USB-C as well as the HDMI port, love it. Stoked and can't wait to get mine. As always, fantastic video!"
2024-03-27,Didn’t the m2 MacBook pros just come out in January? They already replaced it in the same year?
2024-03-27,Does transwomen count for a mixed team?!
2024-03-27,I still have a MacBook with a Touch Bar. And I still like it
2024-03-27,Probably the new log feature or there’s no way they would’ve solely trusted a phone. Also there was less movement in the event and it was much shorter. Less work for the phone.
2024-03-27,im waiting to see how they do with ipad pro m3
2024-03-27,Random guess but I guess Marques is using his Canon R5 shooting this bec the ibis on that on wide angle is wild warping XD
2024-03-27,The big question for a lot of folks in the AI community is how much faster the memory bandwidth is. M3 Max could really help with model tuning and construction.
2024-03-27,"If they made only “space black” laptops, people would go crazy for the new “space silver” MacBooks. Marketing is nothing more than emotion manipulation."
2024-03-27,Apple missed an opportunity to use MJ’s Thriller as a theme song for this event. On some Apple M3ller? Okay maybe not.
2024-03-27,We want a video on “thoughts on Qualcomm ‘s announcement”
2024-03-27,Black and Red Macbook. YES.
2024-03-27,I love how Marquez is worth tens of millions of dollars and hesitates around upgrading tech.
2024-03-27,apple heard about ‘behind the scenes’ thing  and its amazing
2024-03-27,Matte Black everything! Apple did that just for you!
2024-03-27,As a 27” iMac user (weep) finally looking to upgrade.  Should I get a M1Max from B&H for an $1100 discount?
2024-03-27,"Congrats to you, MKHD! I could not care less about the M3. I left Apple's walled garden back in the days of MacOS 9.x."
2024-03-27,Wonderful effort I'm very interested
2024-03-27,I'm maxing out my M1 Max because of the bluetooth hangs on Sonoma. I don't think it will be any better on an M3 Max.
2024-03-27,"When we hit that plateau. Thats when i like to see new features, maybe a different looking product, a gimic here or there maybe it catches on maybe we hate it."
2024-03-27,"My friend and I watched the keynote, I was interested in the chip, but not expecting much since Apple doesn't innovate. It wasn't a game changing event. 

To be perfectly transparent, anyone who bought a phone or laptop in the last 3 years does not need to upgrade. The vast majority of users are not heavy/super users. Most people scroll through Instagram, take a photo, edit a video, tableau, programming, etc all of which can be done on modern devices seemlessly. 

My buddy, who claims he is a bigger tech head than I am, could care less about the M3 performance (he began skipping through the video) which I was shocked about. I'm taking everything Apple says with a grain if salt until yotubers get a chance to do a benchmark test but the second space black came out, my buddy started literally freaking out, jumping up and down and repeated that part of the video 5 times. He basically bought the laptop immediately (in his head)

Seeing his reaction and obviously someone at the MKBHD level also have a similar, but much more reserved perspective, I suspect there will be A LOT of folks who will upgrade specifically for the black colorway. I think it's the dumbest reason someone could think of to spend $2k if they purchased a new laptop in the last 3 to 5 years. And he gets free laptops from work every few months as they look to recycle and renew their IT products. 

This is why I don't buy apple products. People who complain the most about consumerism are also the ones who carry around the apple ecosystem in their pockets, upgrading to new devices every year or every other year, and now...will toss their M1 MacBook that works perfectly fine for a black M3.

I like the products, I don't enjoy the insane price hikes that raises prices for all other devices and brands, lack of annual innovation that somehow justifies an annual price increase, etc. I know people who still use their MacBook from 5, 7 years ago and it's still fine. I've been using the same laptop for 5 years and only now it's showing wear and tear"
2024-03-27,MKBHD wanted a BTS and Apple delivered
2024-03-27,Yo marques congrats for playing for usa on the other note im still surprised that you still love the m1 max macbook pro props to you for not buying the m3 max one cause its not really worth the upgrade im sure this is targeted for intel users
2024-03-27,There is a short (about 2 minutes) behind the scenes out
2024-03-27,"Anyone else feel like, we don't even really need the M2 yet.  Chill out, Apple.  Let it simmer for a minute.

I mean, maybe in a Mac Pro or something..."
2024-03-27,Can't believe Apple charge €920 for upgrading the laptop to 64GB of RAM. Absolute madness. Can't believe people are giving this company business.
2024-03-27,"I pad 1800€ for a 16"" M1 Pro in Space Grey and with C#, HTML, CSS Coding - Video editing with 4k60fps and -
I'm not even close to maxing out the performance of the M1 Pro, if someone actually manages to max out an M1 Pro or Max that would be really intense"
2024-03-27,@mkbhd I’m new to MacBook. My main device is my iPad Pro M2.. which I grab for most things. The iPad is unfortunately not enough for all my work needs so I got a MacBook. My question for you is… Is there a way to get all applications on my MacBook to open in full screen view. I really dislike the minimized windows. I prefer being immersed in what I’m doing.
2024-03-27,Ok. Is your video about the history of processors or M3 MacBookPro?
2024-03-27,"Coming from a 6 year old Surface laptop with a quad core, 16GB of RAM and 512GB drive, it's looking like a decent upgrade but for the price, I could build a top range desktop PC."
2024-03-27,"I’ll finally be dumping my 2018 i5 pro with Touch Bar this year. I’m thinking air with 16gb ram. Otherwise pro with 8gb ram. Not really sure which would be better in the end. Just upgrade right to M3, or go for the M2 air."
2024-03-27,"I got the M3 MacBook Pro!, not because I found the upgrade from M1 to M3 to be useful (the work I do is fairly lightweight: some CAD, some video/photo editing, fair amount of word processing and programming). I simply did so because my M1 2020 MBP decided to sh*t the bed and explode its logic board. Luckily I had bought it only 1 year and 8 months prior (from amazon) and in the UK we have some certain rights to do this this. After about 2 months of back and fourth with Amazon (them telling us they'll contacting me, not contacting me, calling them again and repeat) I was able to get a full refund. Put some money towards it and bought it (From Apple this time, learnt my lesson) with AppleCare. The M3 is a giant but I haven't had a single thing slow down or choke this thing so far. It's insane."

Anyway I digress, more then half of my music is not there. No one is telling about this, or I mist it. I found a video on this. He said Apple told him they will fix it in an upcoming download. Now I checked all my new Apple products they are the same missing music. The only way to get the music on your products is to buy an Apple computer linkit it to your products and put your music in like on my first iPhone and iPad. My old computer is to old and l can’t get the upgrade on the music app. Anyway the price is to high to just do that. It will sit close after that. I use my iPhone most of the time if that."

2024-03-27,"They reduced GPU cores, maybe m3 isn’t as good for your type of workflow? Maybe it overheated and throttled if they used the same amount of cores as the previous gens? They always give us a reason to upgrade to the new MacBook, but they also give us a reason to wonder if maybe we should buy the previous gen or wait for the next one. I had the money on my pocket, ready to buy the new MacBook Pro (because I need the upgrade for my work), and as soon as I saw that they reduced the cores, my urge to buy the m3 crashed. M2 had some serious thermal throttling issues if I remember correctly, m1 is already old to buy right now, which leaves me again to wait for another year with my old 2016 MacBook Pro."

2024-03-27,"Benefit of the doubt here - I would venture to guess that Apple knows that many people with M1-based macs decided to stick with M1s as they were ""plenty fine"" for what they were using them for, so Apple is likely targeting those people specifically with their performance metrics.

So now you can sell your M1 Pro Max with a very good price and you need add a little more to buy the new M4. I don't need the new M3,..but this is a good reason I think. The second reason is the future. Let's say Apple will present the new M4 Pro Max with a much better performance. Everybody will buy it, or buy a used M2 or M3. So we couldn't sell our M1 with a good price. What is your opinion?"
2024-03-27,I still have a 2020 i5 MacBook Air and it's starting to get slow so I might get the M3 to be honest.
2024-03-27,"I was looking at the MacBook Pro 14"" M2 Pro with 32Gb RAM but now I don't know if to get that one or the MacBook Pro 14"" M3 Pro with 34Gb RAM... I don't know if the price difference of 300 is worth it?"
2024-03-27,Video has quite a lot of jello artefacts. Is that from the R5 or post production (stabilize)?
2024-03-27,"Do I need the M3 Pro for video editing or is the M3 good enough? My one (2018) is so loud and slow and also lately doesn’t turn on many times. It also has a wrong day and time, which I strangely can’t change."
2024-03-27,Still rocking the 2019 16” MacBook Pro with 64 gigs of ram  my Mac starting to become a dinosaur
2024-03-27,Still torn on whether to get a MacBook Pro or a Mac
2024-03-27,is there going to be a review on the S23 FE and Xiaomi 14 ?
2024-03-27,went for the m3 MacBook Pro 16 inch.... from the m2 model..... for one reason....... SPACE BLACK! :)
2024-03-27,When will we know if you will purchase a new MacBook Pro or not?
2024-03-27,"One thing I haven’t seen discussed is how they’re not using the M3 for the Vision Pro. I wonder if they’re going to either change it or make 2 versions, one with M2 and the other M3"
2024-03-27,"Your click-bait image suggests that you already have one, when you actually DON'T.  So what is the point of this video?"
2024-03-27,Should I trade in my Mac Studio M1 Pro for that new color and if so what’s the weight and display difference from 14-16 inch?
2024-03-27,It’s mind blowing to me that Apple didn’t change the magic accessories to usb type c. Especially considering they’re the richest computer company
2024-03-27,"My phone has a Snapdragon 888 processor, I've never felt like ""I wish my phone was a little faster or more efficient"" so I didn't upgrade my phone, now that SD Gen 3 is pretty big deal I think ima upgrade."
2024-03-27,Good luck for the ultimate Frisbee games!!!
2024-09-28,What do you think about putting a screen protector on a new MacBook?
2024-03-27,the lamp
2024-03-27,What programs are you using to edit these interior homes? ThNk you so much
2024-03-27,"Apple is encouraging me to upgrade my 6 year old intel iMac by not letting it get the latest OS. So I ordered the M3, but still don’t really need it."
2024-03-27,"Apple reports their earnings tomorrow. It's been a tough economy for the consumer this summer. If it is a clunker earnings report, then this event makes more sense. As you said, it is the events around the events that are most interesting sometimes."
2024-03-27,"ME with most apple products: "" I Dont need it...I dont need it...."" LOL"
2024-03-27,"5:41 ""this is what we expected"" 5:30
well, i expected 150% increase in performance, not 15%."
2024-03-27,"Can someone please explain to me what’s up with the unified memory because in the event Apple calmed that M3 had 24GB, M3 Pro had 36GB and the M3 Max had 128GB of unified memory, but when you go on their website it says the M3 has 8GB, the M3 Pro has 18GB and the M3 Max has 36GB

So yeah i’m kind of confused"
2024-03-27,Crazy Apple actually dropped a BTS
2024-03-27,"I am college student have the macbook pro 13 inch M1 bought in july 2021. I have to use a lot of excel, PowerPoint, 5+ chrome windows, and code running on the side and use my computer w dual monitors. The 8gb ram recently hasn’t been cutting it and system has been crashing frequently battery decreased. Should I upgrade to this new one w student discount or wait for black friday? Its $2300. I have apple care + with my current m1 mac and can get all the parts replaced and sell that and buy this new one. Please let me know what you would recommend."
2024-03-27,You have amazing camera
2024-03-27,"There's no EU requirement to put USB C in keyboards and trackpads. Literally only phones, cameras and tablets I believe."
2024-03-27,"If you get a standard M3 variant, could you see how many monitors it actually supports? I've got the M1 air, and they've obviously curtailed that to a single external. triple monitor support would definitely make me upgrade."
2024-03-27,"Genuinely asking, pls don’t throw stones at me. I’m still using the 2013 macbook pro (majority after effects and minor 3D) and thinking of changing to a new one. Should i change to the newest M3 MBP or the M1 MBP still enough?"
2024-03-27,"Still holding onto my 2019 16 inch, probably won’t upgrade till m4 or m5 lolz"
2024-03-27,@marques brownlee can you please make a video of the best gaming laptops and monitors with ps5 and which one is better laptop or monitor?? Especially for people who are always traveling around and want to have fun
2024-03-27,There is a BTS video on Apple's YT channel. They did miss one thing in the editing of that BTS video. It shows that some of the editor were using DaVinci Resolve instead of Final Cut. You would think Apple would have done a product showcase without showing competitor's products doing their work.
2024-03-27,"I don't know what stabilizer you are using on post, but it is getting me dizzy."
2024-03-27,I got a 2015 base MacBook Air and I think it’s finally time I upgrade lmao
2024-03-27,All the best sir for the Match all love from Bharat 🇮🇳
2024-03-27,"i get that they compare it to M1, because to product cycle on laptop is more like 4-5y, so most sale wouldn't come from people that are even owning M2 or M1, most sale will probaly still come from people still on intel silicon."
2024-03-27,So If the MacBook Pros also get/have an m3 basic option now. With what kind of chip will they upgrade the MacBook Air in 2024? …and how will the MacBook Air compete against the MacBook Pro m3 (basic)?
2024-03-27,"Apple released a behind the scenes clip, albeit only 2 min."
2024-03-27,I think they should have put graphite keys on that black MBP
2024-03-27,Interestingly MKBHD is assuming that everyone has a MacBook M1.
2024-03-27,"Apple, yesterdays performance at tomorrow's prices.  Are you cool enough?"
2024-03-27,Hello MKBHD. Can you do a video on the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite and its potential to rival Apple's M3? It is designed by senior staff that worked on Apple Silicon.
2024-03-27,"Boy put your hand down in that thumbnail . Please, my first thought was Germany"
2024-03-27,"Huh, he always looked like someone who thought Frisbee is a sport."
2024-03-27,"Apple finally made your Matte dream come true, Marquese)))) Can't wait to change my old  man (macbook pro 2015 :d )"
2024-03-27,would buying a Macbook Air M1 in 2024 still ok as in will the performance be impacted in a way or not getting latest OS update or some kind? I’m a casual user no need for advanced features
2024-03-27,"that lamp behind you, can you make it straight?"
2024-03-27,Apple probably made a matte black laptop just to get mkbhd to upgrade .
2024-03-27,"Hey marques just wanna know why haven't you review any GaN charger such as Baseus 100w, Ugreen 100w , Mcdodo 100w or 120w etc????"
2024-03-27,"You said it mate.  And you have the money to just go 'meh, it's a little faster and a cool color, I'll keep it' but no, you sent a strong message saying....""um.....no.  It's not scary fast.  Not for Davinci anyway""."
2024-03-27,One color is all you need to sway Mr Brownlee
2024-03-27,I’m literally just upgrading to get that black MacBook Pro
2024-03-27,You are right Bro
2024-03-27,"they should have skipped the whole event. make m3 more like the m4 with developing longer and put out the imac with usb c accesories and give every other release, be it macbook pro, air or ipad the same treatment. i dont get this fragmentation and dont understand who the target group is with these products"
2024-03-27,this guy’s hands are MASSIVE. Jesus.
2024-03-27,"As an  employee, they have the best marketing to make you feel FOMO"
2024-03-27,"the m3 could probably come with a better interface to windows apps (if not runs natively), it came around like at same moment with microsoft saying about ""portability to arm CPUs"""
2024-03-27,Did they not say A.I. development on several occasions with the M3 Max?
2024-03-27,"IF you were to upgrade to the newest Mac today, what specs would YOU pay for as a content creator?"
2024-03-27,Are they releasing an m3 MacBook Air? Looking forward to that one fs
2024-03-27,"MBL, great, snooker first look and thoughts. I'll probably need just an M1... Even just refurbished , AIR or PRO."
2024-03-27,"Marques, your macbook pro m3 review must be shot on an iPhone 15"
2024-03-27,The lamp on the back dude
2024-03-27,A rich man like you should have pressed t shirts....
2024-03-27,Is an M1 still worth buying going into 2024...or would you g M2 or M3?
2024-03-27,"Apple could win an entirely new segment. Gamers. 

Just start optimising the CPUs and GPUs for gaming, start talking with developers about game compatibility. I'd be much more open to a Mac if it had more compatible games and also better performance on the games you can run already"
2024-03-27,The M1 MacBook Pros are just too good to upgrade from (I own one myself) it’s like Apple got everything right with that computer. It reminds me of how we all loved the 2015 MacBook pros and kept them for years & refused to upgrade because it just simply worked so well. The only thing I would do is upgrade to an M1 Max chip 64GB ram
2024-03-27,Still waiting for a front facing camera thats half decent
2024-03-27,"Well the question becomes, do you wait for an M3 Ultra chip setup?  Do you wait for OLED screen?  The new structure of this chip will have Apple in the labs experimenting with dual M3 setups for their desktop pro computers... When thermal throttling has been investigated and they determine if it will be too bad to market them in the MacBook Pro then we will see if a new M3 Ultra shows up in the MacBook Pro.  Also, OLED screens use less energy and are brighter but suffer from burn in.  It is unlikely that Apple will solve the burn-in issue themselves when LG and Sony have not solved this to date.  So the question, at least for me, is do I pay all this money for an M3 Max ""stepping stone"", which is supposed to be 11 times faster than my intel i9 laptop here, which I know suffers from thermal throttling, or do I wait for a possible M3 (M4, M5) Ultra and/or OLED screen.  But then that's the question each time Apple releases a new product."
2024-03-27,"Any news on whether these new machines will be repairable, will have user replaceable batteries and will have components that can be replaced by independent repair shops? The last mac/iPad I bought that didn’t have faulty components was the 12” Powerbook in the early 2000s! Since then MacBook Pros, iPad Pro and iMac all had issues."
2024-03-27,They’ve mentioned a number of times during the keynote how their new chips blow Intel out of the water. People who have the latest M series chip might be okay to skip the upgrade. It seems they’re pushing for the users with intel based models to upgrade which is why the new entry level MacBook Pro got the price reduction but upgraded performance. (Compared to intel)
2024-03-27,"I need help here. Im an intel i7 windows user with 32gb ram and basic 1050 gtx nvdia card. Its high time for upgrade. I use Ableton, cubase ( music DAW) and unreal, blender for vfx and cgi work. Its extremely hard in unreal to add go beyond certain limits. Now should i just go for the new mac book with m3 and if M3 what type? Or should i go for something else ? Thank you for your help guys :)"
2024-03-27,I wonder if you know my daughter Octavia Payne? She’s an Ultimate Frisbee Champion.

2024-03-27,"I purchased the M2 Pro MacBook Pro in September :(
Too late to return, too much to trade in and get the new one"

2024-03-27,Does the new matte space black macbooks leave alot of  fingerprints like the air m2?

2024-03-27,At this point Apple's blazing fast speeds have become boring. When you're ahead being further ahead still just means you're ahead.
2024-03-27,Bro it’s the same thing . M1 is still popping
2024-03-27,Can you review the light phone?
2024-03-27,"So hypothetically if I get the new matte black macbook, what would you estimate is the lifecycle of it? Is this a laptop I can have a decade from now?"
2024-03-27,"Brother , how is the Tesla Solar Roof working for you so far?"
2024-03-27,there's literally no need tp=o get the newer products. M1 and m2 is still blazing fast
2024-03-27,Why isn’t anyone talking about how many Apple updates are getting pushed to us lately? It seems like there are multiple per week now!! They are basically beta testing on us at this point. I miss when software came in a box and the company had to make the releases good enough that you wanted to go to a store and buy and install it.
2024-03-27,Thank you for your review and thank you for representing our great country USA

2024-03-27,"Hello, Im  a high school senior and I’m looking for a MacBook to use for my upcoming freshman year in university. I’ll be majoring in Pre med so I won’t need a super powerful laptop, but just one that can handle what I’ll be doing. My budget is $2,000. Can you help me decide what MacBook is best for me?"
2024-03-27,"My question is what would be faster, new M3 pro with 11 core cpu, 14 core gpu and 18 gb memory, or; regular M3 with 8 core cpu, 10 core gpu, and upgrading memory to 24 gb? Both are $1,999."

2024-03-27,Technology is strong and the flesh is weak.
2024-03-27,Was that a Windows wallpaper on his M1 Mac tho?
2024-03-27,"Seriously, I can't believe that you didn't even mention the base model of the MacBook ""Pro"" comes with 8 GB of RAM for the hefty price tag of 1,600 USD! That's a lot of money to throw at a new device, be it Apple or not. In fact, my old base model MacBook Pro released in mid 2014 also had 8 GB of RAM and that was almost 10 years ago. Scandalous!! We need a bit more critical reflection on what these tech companies are doing instead of comments on how we can upgrade for a minor performance boost and because the new product is more shiny."
2024-03-27,It Buggs me that apple doesn't have a good powerful iMac now for productivity
2024-03-27,i literally just bought the m2 air why they just release 1 every year???

2024-03-27,"We are not all paid by apple and need to work hard to buy a new model. I must save for maybe 2 - 3 years to get the newest I guess M5, but that's okay. I don't need a new model every year."
2024-03-27,"the image stabalization is very ugly in this video, the background looks like its some weird 3D wobbly effect"
2024-03-27,that lampshade tho lmao
2024-03-27,I think it’s time I upgrade my early 2011 MacBook Pro
2024-03-27,"They shouldn't make it a yearly update. Even the M1 is still very viable now, or even next two years for majority of people."
2024-03-27,"Hello, I need a suggestion please. What should I choose, MacBook Pro 14 M2 Pro 10 core 16gb ram 16 GPU 512 Ssd or new MacBook Pro 14 M3 base 8 core 8gb RAM 10 GPU 512 ssd? Both have the same price!! It’s my first Macbook. Thank you!"
2024-03-27,"You believe 8ram is enough ?
I am looking to buy MacBook Air 15 but now I consider to get the M3 pro because of small price difference.
But the question is : do I need to get more than 8gb ram ?"
2024-03-27,Hey Marques. Would really appreciate a thorough comparison between the new iMac M3 (base vs upgraded). Do these models also have differences in fan and heating systems? Is it worth the extra 150$ (if a finger ID keyboard is configured to the base model) for the 2 extra core GPU for a medical student? Thanks
2024-03-27,Do you think they'll add the 600nits feature to the m1 and m2 macbook pros through a software update considering that they have the exact same screen?
2024-03-27,Is it better to shutdown MacBook Pro 14 inch M2 everyday or sleep it
2024-03-27,Does not work. There is no system preferences on my mac. I would post a screen shot if it would let me. My mac is up to date.
2024-03-27,"Wow, the French version is not good. What technology did you use? The sound is okay, but the voice is far from your real voice, and the lip sync is only average.

Finally now that they have gotten back on the right track (MagSafe, hdmi port, keyboard fix, etc) I’m thinking about upgrading. My only concern with the 14in M3 would be the lack of ram and not being able to connect it to a 2 monitor docking station. Would it make any sense to get an older M2 pro so I can support 2 monitors and get 16gbs of ram? I do pretty much all my work on a 2 monitor setup. It looks like I can get one for about $1700 which is only a $100 more than the new M3… Thanks for any thoughts!"
2024-03-27,"I think its kenough.
IT'S A MAC
ANYWHERE ELSE IT'D BE A 10"
2024-03-27,IF YOU EVENTUALLY DO UPGRADE...CAN I GET THE OLD ONE YOU ARE CURRENTLY USING...PLEEEEEEASE THANKS
2024-03-27,It would be advantageous for Apple to not charge x2 what laptops are worth.

2024-03-27,"I am going to just buy mac mini's until this settles down. I was burned on the m1 macbook pro 13 inch. the touch bar started flickering like a strobe light within a week. I knew i had to get rid of it. Worst made 1st gen system i have ever seen. Never doing that again. Maybe 5 years from now i will buy another mac notebook. But when you can buy a dell and they will replace the entire notebook whenever there is issues, that is amazing support. Mac support is just not there. A mini works for now, thats as far as I go. Even the mini though, whats with 8gigs of ram and 256 hd? Welcome to 2008?"
2024-03-27,They're probably comparing M3 macs to M1 because most people still have M1

2024-03-27,"Okay, this year Apple blew it away with the 15s, but this announcement was such a miss. The new MacBook Pro starting at $1599 with 8GB/512GB SSD with regular M3 chip is ridiculous. Just buy a refurbished M2 Pro mac for the same price and get a chip with more cores, more memory, and same storage. The iMac starting with 256GB is a bigger joke."

Not only that, Apple has said good bye to intel applications, all new applications developers will compile for apple silicon which will be way fast far future of say 3-4 years developers will just drop intel support for apple. Qualcomm/Microsoft just cant do that. In time, apples application will be better and better because of the new architecture."

The big advantage for you and yes,
you do evaluate these products for us,
is that you can pay for them.
Apple  schtick is trying to entice those in the middle financial
range to get these things because Apple says they are soooo good!
 But like you said, do most of us really need the upgrade??
Apple has a team of psychologist who can push our buttons so they can 
generate as much income as possible, but let us think they are the ultimate product when for most of us,
they are not!!!

Their target audience are not buying new ones every year or every two years. So, they need to chill. MacBooks are not iPhones. Even the average iPhone user wants their iPhone to last for 5 years, or at least I want my iPhone to last for 5 years before changing it. So, no, intel Mac users can consider buying the new m3, but m1 and m2 users don't need m3"

Great video but it's a no sale for me."
2024-03-27,"Macs are boring. They haven't changed in years. Apple simply replaces the chip inside of them and sell the same stuff to people like you who drool over it.

2024-03-27,"So far, it appears rather disappointing. Releasing the M3 chip in an actively cooled chassis makes it seem like a hot chip, prompting a pause before implementing it in a passive cooled chassis. This decision could be attributed to the negative impact of previous MacBook Air models on MacBook Pro sales, which used to account for around 54%, but now only around 40%. Consequently, they need to present better figures to investors.

However, even the base model of the M3 Pro chip has only 11 cores, slower RAM compared to the M2 Pro, and there's still uncertainty about the SSD. If you want the slightly improved M3 Pro over the M2 Pro, you'll need to spend an additional 3000 euros, which doesn't make much sense. In general, the shift from 8 performance cores clocked at 3.5GHz to 6 cores at 3.7GHz may result in a hotter device or require getting used to fan noise again. So far, it doesn't look promising."

2024-03-27,"So buying a new computer every generation is just wasteful. The general thing companies do is uprade every 5 years. Even outside of work I don't uprade every cycle but every 2-3 cycles. 15% every gen is actually really good increase and I feel like yeah the m2 didn't feel revolutionary but between a M1 and an M2 I would take the M2 unless i got a good deal on the m1. As for M3 it might finally be the computer that makes me go for a Mac as a primary machine rather than a hobby machine depending on the raytracing performance in Blender, Redshift and Arnold. I like doing preview renders while working and the fact that Nvidia is so much faster makes Nvidia the defacto winner even if it is less power efficient, heavier etc. Like Laptop/desktop sales should be kind of static same with cellphones, tablets etc. Which is what we are seeing. The market is hitting saturation and people are upgrading as their older devices go bad or are no longer supported. That is exactly what you want. I have an iPhone XR it works. The battery is fine and since it got an software update and security updates this year I probably won't upgrade it."
