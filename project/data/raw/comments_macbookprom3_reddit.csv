2024-11-06,People who do basic tasks get mba not mbp
2024-11-06,I do basic things and still got a mbp.
2024-11-07,Why?
2024-11-07,Why not Jesus almighty. Do u use every inch of your gaming laptop or desktop. Mbp it's just a much better Mac. It's that easy.
2024-11-06,"I can rationalize a base model pro, why not. $500 more for a machine I‚Äôm keeping for 5-10 years, I‚Äôm getting a m4 over m3, better screen, better speakers, better mic, more usb ports, hdmi port, card slot, extra 256 gb storage, and probably other features I‚Äôm missing. 

Not to mention you can get an Apple refurbished base m3 pro for $1200, $100 more than what the air starts at. you‚Äôd get 8gb ram but you most likely wont notice the difference, you would notice all the features the pro offers over the air though. Also, you could definitely find a deal on a base model pro m3 with 16 gb. Someone just posted earlier that they got a pro with m3 pro chip for like $1300. This is a terrible time to buy a MacBook Air at full price. 

If it‚Äôs really just for school get a used m1 for like 400 bucks. you‚Äôll notice no difference between that and a brand new air"
2024-11-06,That might have been me. I am typing this on my brand new M3 Pro (18 gb) that I got for $1300 + tax.
2024-11-06,"Dude ur lucky as hell. Can u share details? Like was this second hand, refurbished, and where exactly did you find this ridiculously good deal?"
2024-11-07,"Sorry for the late response! It is a brand new, factory sealed, M3 Pro, 18 gb RAM with the 512 SSD. I have a good friend who owns a buy/sell/trade in my college town. Figured I'd ask him for his stock and he had a college student come in and sell it to him a month or so ago. Assuming it was a gift that he didnt need or something. He paid 1000 for it so I ended up buying it off of him for 1300+tax (something like $1397) and then the ground shipping. So all in I paid around $1450.

Got it today and I am engineer so I have a work laptop. This thing will be an at home computer that I can also use on the go. I am very happy with this purchase and hope it will last me a good chunk of years (hoping 5-6 out of it)."
2024-11-07,That‚Äôs honestly crazy congrats
2024-11-07,Thank you!
2024-11-06,I dont buy used electronics
2024-11-06,"Your flair literally says m3 max. So either you legitimately need it for heavy use in which case I agree, I wouldn‚Äôt buy something like that refurbished either. If I can afford $3000 I can afford $3300. Or, you‚Äôre a casual user who thinks he needs it. Either way my comment wasn‚Äôt for you"
2024-11-06,"I got mine for $3,500 with tax and interest and stuff. I bought it online with the payment plan thing. I mainly use it for gaming so i did need the high specs"
2024-11-11,I got my MBP so I can have 100s of browser tabs open =)
2024-11-11,I got mine so i can play video games and also use macOS :3
2024-11-15,What world are we in now that basic tasks require 24 - 48GB of RAM? I thought a year ago 8 GB would be fine for basic tasks.

2024-11-06,"This is the Apple intelligence summary :

  
The M3 MacBook Pro has a sleek design with a satisfying keyboard and useful ports. The 14-inch model is recommended for portability, while the 16-inch is better suited for those who prioritize a larger screen. Battery life is excellent, lasting all day with heavy usage.

MacOS is the best Apple operating system, offering features like audio playback from multiple sources and seamless file management. The latest macOS 15.2 Beta 2 introduces the long-awaited ultrawide Mac virtual display, enhancing productivity. Upgrading from an Intel Mac to an Apple Silicon device is highly recommended, as it offers significant improvements in speed, battery life, and overall performance.

The M3 MacBook Pro is praised for its design and performance, but the M4 MacBook Pro or M1 Pro MacBook Pro are better deals. The MacBook Air is recommended for most users, while the M3 Pro is better suited for those seeking a premium laptop experience."

2024-11-07,"TLDR (Sonnet 3.5): 

Here‚Äôs a concise summary of the detailed M3 MacBook Pro review:

Key Points:
- Review based on one year with 14-inch base M3 Pro MacBook Pro (11-core CPU, 14-core GPU, 18GB RAM, 512GB storage)
- Space black finish holds up well against scratches and fingerprints
- Excellent battery life with 100% health after 70 charge cycles
- MacOS Sequoia praised for versatility and features like iPhone Mirroring
- Apple Intelligence feels incomplete and rushed

Recommendations:
1. Don‚Äôt buy M3 Pro MacBook Pro now; instead:
   - Get base M4 MacBook Pro ($1599) for better value
   - Consider M1 Pro MacBook Pro (~$1000) for significant savings

2. MacBook Air vs Pro decision:
   - Air is sufficient for 90% of users
   - Pro justified for:
     - Intensive tasks (video editing, 3D modeling)
     - Premium display requirements
     - Need for additional ports
     - Wanting a more premium experience

Upgrade Advice:
- Definite upgrade recommended from Intel-based Macs
- Less compelling upgrade from M1 or later models unless specific needs exist
- Consider MacBook Air unless Pro features are specifically required

The review concludes that while the M3 MacBook Pro is an excellent device, current buyers should consider either the new M4 model or the older M1 Pro version for better value.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã"

2024-11-07,Very well written thank you
2024-11-06,"I‚Äôm in the same situation you were in a year ago. I occasionally use my mom‚Äôs 15‚Äù M2 Air, and it‚Äôs definitely a huge upgrade from my 2017 i5. I‚Äôm tempted to make the jump to an M1, but after seven years, I feel like I can stretch it a bit longer and wait for the rumored OLED screens‚Äîespecially since I don‚Äôt need to upgrade every 3-4 years.

Great review!"
2024-11-06,"OLED is worse for me, mini LED is far superior. Take M4 now, don‚Äôt spend your time in waiting. Better resell and take OLED (i don‚Äôt think it come either)"
2024-11-06,"They‚Äôll do it their own way though, hence why they‚Äôre not rushing into releasing the new displays. Apple displays almost universally outperform the rest of the market for image quality as it is, they‚Äôll do OLED their way, so we‚Äôll see what that‚Äôll look like. Either way their current displays are üëå"
2024-11-06,"Currently using M1 Pro 14‚Äù, just considering about upgrade to 16‚Äù version with ray-tracing chip. The screen of 14‚Äù is really not enough for me while multitasking, especially splitting screen.

Has anyone have the experience about using 16‚Äù and  doesn‚Äôt recommend it beyond the reason of weight?"
2024-11-06,"16"" all the way"
2024-11-06,"I‚Äôve got 14‚Äù and 16‚Äù M1 MBP (Personal &amp; Work). I‚Äôd recommend the 16. Virtually no weight difference and the screen size is worth it. 
The best trick I figured out was being first in the queue for buses and sitting up back where there‚Äôs double seats and lots of leg/screen room. Similar deal on trains."
2024-11-07,"I had a 16‚Äù M1, 16gb, 1TB that was amazingly fast compared to the i7 15‚Äú it replaced. I now have an M3 MAX, 64gb, 2tb and for 3D and bigger multimedia creation it beats the M1. If your needs are not high end then I would say an M1,16gb,1TB is enough to get you through the next 5 years Nicely. The day-to-day stuff most people do will never challenge it."
2024-11-06,"I‚Äôd like to thank you for your post. I spent few hours today with looking on new M4 Pro and was considering it over upcoming M4 Air. 

I have desktop Win PC (bought this year) and my old Win laptop is no longer functioning.  I‚Äôd mainly use it for web, YouTube , making notes etc as majority of users, but I‚Äôd like to launch some games occasionally when I‚Äôm out of home (4-5days in month). 
At this point I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more reasonable to go for M4 Pro (base model with 16GB RAM and 512 SSD). Display, ports, thermal management with fans seems to be much better choice over Air. Unless Air would come with 120Hz what I highly doubt. 

Anyway it‚Äôs worth reading for anyone who is new at MCB."
2024-11-06,This is my exact thought process. Coming from a 9 year old windows laptop I‚Äôm looking at the base m4 pro. The extra ports base specs thermal management and display are why I‚Äôm edging to the pro over the air! Now I just need to decide which colour üòÇ

(Moving on)"
2024-11-06,"I am a first time Mac owner. I bought the same exact model and configuration as you. I love the laptop, and it does what I need it to. The only problems I run into are gaming, but Mac‚Äôs have NEVER been known for gaming. I know they‚Äôve opened up the architecture and they are broadening the platform to allow for easier development.

That being said, I wish I had jumped for 32GB of ram and seeing the M4 Pro coming with 24GB at the base made me wish I had waited out just a LITTLE longer before jumping the gun. I feel as though maybe I should trade-in and upgrade, but I recognize I‚Äôm not at the point of my academic career that I could need more. For programming/ coding, I went with MAC so I could have access to MacOs and windows. I didn‚Äôt want to limit myself to one OS in case I wanted to specialize or really just be flexible. Really a wants versus needs dilemma."
2024-11-06,What games have you tried? I pretty much stick to WoW and it plays good on a MBA.
2024-11-06,"I‚Äôm sure it does! Even with the ‚Äúgraphical upgrade‚Äù, wow isn‚Äôt exactly intensive in that regard. I‚Äôve tried a few things, and naturally indie games run well. The biggest problem I run into are games on Steam that are compatible. Some games aren‚Äôt listed as MacOs, but can natively run.

So far I‚Äôve played‚Ä¶.

FF14 (max settings before the latest expansion ran at 100FPS without problems. I don‚Äôt know about after the graphical upgrade)

Resident Evil 7 (ran surprisingly well. A couple of stutters and issues but it seemed to have been a RAM issue wishing I had shelled out for more)

Rise of the Tomb Raider (ran surprisingly well)

Bioshock Remastered (ran great)

I just got Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3 and I‚Äôm interested in testing it since it has a native MacOs port.

Now, this is where I run into problems. With how windows needs to be ran with M3, it does feel like it eats a bit of ram. So running windows and trying to run Steam it struggles a little. 

FF7 Remake wouldn‚Äôt even get through the start menu

Mass Effect Legendary Edition seemed to have problems with frames

Master Chief Collection lagged hard and had audio issues

Digimon Survive had audio issues with cutscenes

Still have more to test as I don‚Äôt do A LOT of PC gaming. I like it as an option when I travel with my MacBook or if I‚Äôm feeling lazy and want to play some games in bed away from my PS5."
2024-11-06,"Thanks for your in-depth review!

I came to this sub as I‚Äôm trying to figure out whether or not I should get an M3 at a discount (16GB RAM, 1TB for $1,399 at Best Buy as of now) or just pay more and get the M4. I have a fossil (late 2013 MBP), so anything is a serious upgrade lol. Your review has definitely helped, so thank you!"
2024-11-07,Pay more for the M4 my boi
2024-11-07,Tbh I just might.. I keep going back &amp; forth. The space black is calling my name. Best Buy already has the base model M4 with $50 off and there‚Äôs supposed to be a door buster deal for Black Friday. I‚Äôll wait &amp; see!
2024-11-06,Looks neat! Which case is that?
2024-11-06,"On battery life.  I followed apple's directions here about not plugging it while using it.  I have not had to recharge it since the original charge when I bought it.  I first bought it when it came out, not sure when."
2024-11-06,"Now the real question is, did you write all this on the macbook?"
2024-11-06,"DAMN THAT's a long post but I can always paste it on google to read it for me.   
but for teh bits I've got to read I wouldn't exchange any laptop yearly. I'd at least, wait 2 or 3 years to see a real benefic that would be worth of my money. Right now, I'm using a old 8 yo laptop that still does what I need it for. I'm not saying you should waaaaitt this long but yearly you wouldn't see any real benefit."
2024-11-06,"I upgraded from M1 MBP to M3 MBP and I honestly I‚Äôm not impressed, several occasions my m3 freezes on me and needs a hard reboot to even get the track pad to work, my m1 worked flawlessly from launch to last year when I upgraded"
2025-03-10,Do you normally upgrade your laptop every 2 years? Seems like it wouldn't be worth it that often.
2025-03-10,I actually got the m3 through work so grabbed the opportunity but otherwise won‚Äôt upgrade till at least 4 years

2024-11-06,Do you keep your computer plugged in basically all the time?

2024-11-06,"Well, yeah, keeping a laptop plugged in all the time is terrible for the battery. If you‚Äôre gonna mainly use your computer plugged in at a desk, you‚Äôre much better off getting a desktop computer"
2024-11-06,Use AIDente - it caps your battery percentage so it doesn‚Äôt remain at 100% which strains your battery I hear this helps for battery health
2024-11-06,How is the battery life? My batteries drain very quickly.

2025-01-01,Curious why you would not recommend it now?  I am also coming from a 2017 13‚Äù MBP thats struggling.    I‚Äôve been looking at the 1500-1999 window and the base m4 and Apple refurb M3Pro 18/512 are the same price.  1799 if I want to bump to 36/512 with the M3P or 1999 for 36/1T.  But at that point I am at the M4Pro 24/512 budget.  At this rate I‚Äôll finally pull the trigger on the new M6. :)
2025-01-30,"So I do heavy duty video and photo editing, and occasionally 3d modeling, should i get the m3 pro refurbished for $1300 or find a used m4 base mbp?"
2024-11-06,Why the fuck did somebody write a thesis about if they like a MacBook.

2024-11-06,I think it‚Äôs as simple as OP seems like the type to buy products with no reviews.
2025-03-16,"As someone with a very similar old intel mac upgrading now, I just got a refurbished-but-as-good-as-new-I-checked M3 pro for 300 dollars less than a new base M4 and I thought it seemed like a deal way too good to pass up. ..But I'm thinking of returning it, kind of scared of using it more than I already have. Wondering if a new M3/M4 Air or maybe the M1 pro I was originally looking at would be cheaper and better in weight, value, color/wear/vibe, keyboard language(the one I got was German, and it works well, but hmm) etc. I really appreciate this post lol. Though I worry about longevity/support of mac M1. I don't want to need maintenance stuff or extra modding."
2024-04-20,Well it is worth it in Apple‚Äôs lineup. Because the base M3 is more than powerful enough but it comes with 8GB of RAM which is not enough. And by the time you upgrade to the 16GB you are way to close to the M3 Pro which is better in every single way not to get that.
2024-04-20,"Yeah, i watched a lot of reviews on the M3 series. I came to a conclusion like this:
Basic M3 - not worth it
M3 pro - most worth it
M3 Max - too fuckin expensive üòÇ

Yes, I heard basic M3 with 8GB RAM is not worth it, better 16 gigs. While if I were to upgrade, rather just go straight to M3 pro."
2024-04-20,I have the 16‚Äú m3 pro with 18gb ram and wouldn‚Äôt want to change it to the regular m3 chip tbh. Difference is night and day but you need to be able to know what you do with it. I run a vm and a small ai with my mbp and steam it via internet on my 15‚Äú mb air
2024-04-20,"yes, I noticed the difference between the pro and the basic m3 chip. it is pretty good deal adding extra several hundred dollars for the extra performance"
2024-04-20,If you want 16 or 24gb on m3 you can as well go for the 18gb base m3 pro ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇüòÖüëç
2024-04-20,I‚Äôm taking the M3 Pro. it is worth the price.
2024-04-20,"Can definetly recommend. If you take 14 base m3 pro with m3 pro chip you get a machine only 100grams more heavy than the 15‚Äú air too. But keep in mind base m3 pro in 14‚Äú is only the 11/14 core config, not the 12/18 like the m3 pro base in 16‚Äú. But that‚Äôs about 600-700 gram more heavy than the 15 air ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòú"
2024-04-20,There is absolutely no need for the M3 Max unless your workflow is really demanding
2024-04-20,"Yea M3 Max is way out of my budget. and way out of my needs also. I just need a system that is portable, performance high enough to install and use Ps, FCP in a long term period. I saw my 2019 Air already struggling to meet my needs. 

I‚Äôm hoping this M3 Pro can lasts 8 years+. A lot of my friends have a Macbook pro that lasts approximately 7+ years and still running smoothly. The only problem they have is the battery, but it is not significant. They use the same apps like Ps and FCP but the system still run as if it was the first 3 month of usage.

My Air 2019, is now 5 years old. It still runs, but the lagging is getting annoying. Every time I open the laptop, it freezes for 1 minutes. I can‚Äôt even use chrome because it took too much space in the RAM (I open 7-8 apps at the same time excluding chrome, finders, spotify). The Ps still runs also, but it often freeze during launch. Now, I open only 3-5 apps to make my macbook work properly. My work requires me to compare documents, and to multitask between windows. So it is necessary to have a smooth multitasking system. I want this smoothness to last me a decade at least."
2024-04-20,"I own a macbook pro 14 (m3 pro) currently and use Davinci Resolve and Premiere pro (along with ps, ai, id, xd, vscode, and a few others) and at no point has it ever been problematic. I‚Äôve had it since basically release and the only time i‚Äôve seen some slowdowns were when i had some really large illustrator files, but as far as 4k editing for video goes, not even a hiccup! (and things like the ms suite and canva also shouldn‚Äôt pose any problems lol)

Off note btw, Davinci Resolve has been exponentially better than premier pro (and has a free version that‚Äôs more than enough!), highly recommend checking it out! FCP is fine but lacks support from apple, so DVR has more features."
2024-04-20,"damn, thanks for the in-depth explanation of your experience! 

I shouldn‚Äôt have any problem with large illustrator files since I mainly just use PS. And it is also approximately medium workload. Since PS and the upcoming video editing work is all side jobs. I‚Äôm glad to hear that all the apps that I am currently working on are all working smoothly. (yes I also figured ms office and canva is not the problem in M3 Pro lmaoüòÇ)

Yes, I heard from my friend that FCP is not really supported in mac that is why I‚Äôm worried and thinking of just using premier pro. I am curious about the Davinci Resolve though, I‚Äôm certainly gonna check it out. Thanks for the recommendation man! 

I think based on your experience, I‚Äôm firm on buying the M3 Pro!"
2024-05-18,"Hey I‚Äôve been thinking about buying a MacBook pro m3 pro. Idk much about laptops tho but I need it for small film projects and some other stuff. Is cpu and gpu on this good? Is there enough storage? Sorry about all the Questions, I‚Äôm so clueless."
2024-05-18,"the macbook pro m3 pro is very very good. I bought the macbook already. i would say and i also recite this from the apple store employee, the macbook pro m3 pro is more than enough for everyday use. it is more optimized for creative work that uses photoshop, premiere, illustrator, and DVR. 

The apple store employee said that if you are looking for just light work like MS Office, the normal macbook pro M3 is enough. even the macbook air is also enough. But if you are doing light-moderate editing and creative work using photoshop, DVR, it is better to buy the M3 pro instead since it offers you more power for seamless editing experience.

dont get me wrong, regular M3 is also sufficient for using photoshop etc, but it is recommended to buy the M3 pro instead because it is more comfortable. The employee even said to me, if you are looking for normal M3, just buy the M2 instead, the power difference is not big but cheaper. 

most of the youtube reviews that i watched said, if you are going to buy the normal M3, better to upgrade the ram to 16gb, because nowadays 8gb is not enough to accommodate our fast changing technologies. and if you were to upgrade to 16gb of ram, the price is almost like the M3 pro with 18gb of ram and better chipset. thus, if you are planning to buy a macbook with M3 chipset, at least buy the M3 pro, it is more worth it than the normal M3 chip. 

for the storage, 1tb is enough, i dont really have personal pics or media stored in my laptop. my macbook is solely for work. there is only docs, psds, pdfs, excels files inside my macbook. so, yes 1 tb is enough for me. if its not enough for you, you can buy external harddisk, it is cheaper than upgrading storage. or, icloud upgrade is always available

for almost 1 month of usage, my macbook pro m3 pro has been very very helpful in my work. VERY i would say. because i upgraded from intel-based macbook air, which becomes very laggy. and the upgrade to m3 pro is very substantial."
2024-05-18,"Thank you so much, this is really helpful!! I think I‚Äôm going to buy the m3 pro."
2024-05-19,no worries! i‚Äôm glad that my reply is helpful to you. enjoy your m3 pro! üòÅ
2024-10-03,I know this is a dead post but Apple Store employees are crazy. M3 pro for office use??????
2024-10-06,"you need to read it again and understand the storyline. I said I‚Äôm looking for a Macbook Pro M3. Which one should I use for light work and which one I use for moderate work. the employee told me the Macbook Pro M3 is enough for office use. Enough doesn‚Äôt mean that he is recommending it. If anything I think it‚Äôs more than enough. And all my questions is only about the performance and if the hardware is sufficient for the workload or not. And not about the budget. I was looking for a recent release of Macbook Pro and he recommended the M3 Pro if I were to use it for moderate editing, etc.

So, I guess the apple employee is not crazy and he just answered all my questions. At least not in the Apple store in my area. He even suggested to buy the M2 instead because it made more sense to purchase considering the performance difference is not significant compared to the M3. But I insisted on buying the newest version.

and my work is not only office buddy. I work in a lot of sectors. and my laptop is for all of that. I work with MS office, DVR, photoshop, illustrator, even a bit of UI/UX. So my M3 pro is for all of that and not office only"
2024-10-06,"I see, I misunderstood"
2024-10-12,"Hi, I hope you don't mind me following up on your message. Since your last post, are you satisfied with your MacBook Pro M3 Pro ? While doing some research online, I came across some information suggesting it has battery issues.."
2024-04-20,"I‚Äôm glad I was able to help you c: It‚Äôs a great laptop and will last you many years to come! 

Yeah it‚Äôs sad, I also wanted FCP to be great. But having primarily used premier most my life, I can at least confirm Premier is the worst of the 3, crashes, bugs, terrible ui, and an even worse monthly payment system! 

Sorry for the tangent, but also know this mac is the baseline for multi monitor support which is a massive plus if you ever do that!!"
2024-04-21,"I mostly use my macbook for travel since I got PC in my house. Yes thank you so much for the help!

I‚Äôm ordering the Macbook Pro M3 Pro rn! but I got another question, is the 96w worth? because it is very cheap to upgrade rather than buy it individually. But the thing is if I were to upgrade the 96w, I need to wait for 1 month for the stock. Is it worth it?"
2024-04-21,"I Personally didn‚Äôt get the upgraded charger, just because I know i‚Äôll end up using my third party Anker one anyway (it‚Äôs smaller, lighter, more wattage and more ports, all for less than any apple charger). But if you think you‚Äôll use it, then by all means sure why not.

(which i do)

Though it is larger and heavier than the base charger they provide for what that‚Äôs worth."
2024-04-22,"i see. I think I‚Äôll just skip upgrading to 96w and also go buy third party like you. 1 month is too long since in 3 weeks time I‚Äôm overseas alr. Again, Thank you so much for the help man. üôè"
2024-04-22,"No worries, glad I could help! 

I own this one personally: https://a.co/d/2HDQkGj 

But there‚Äôs a ton others, just look for ‚ÄúGaN‚Äù chargers."
2024-07-03,"Thanks for this, what kind of footages are you working with davinci resolve? I hear people complaining about slow render times and media offline issues. I also want to buy the M3 Pro and I also use Davinci (+after effects and blender) but still making my researches. How‚Äôs your experience with it so far?"
2024-08-09,Hey I know this is old but how much ram did yours come with?
2024-08-09,18gb ram! (tbh if i were in the past i‚Äôd upgrade that)
2024-08-10,"&gt;Thank you!

You're welcome!"
2024-08-10,No not you
2024-08-19,"no problem, hope you enjoy!"
2024-08-09,"It‚Äôs been a lil while since my previous statements and I feel like I was def glazing a lil, machine def has its limits that i‚Äôve hit often, especially with running many heavy programs with big projects at once. While i‚Äôve seen a few beach balls, it‚Äôs rarely has it given up! (and lessening the workload def helps) 

Think this is more of a limited ram issue than cpu for sure!"
2024-08-16,"Hi, sorry for bumping this back up. I am wondering how long can a fully charged M3 Pro Mac runs using normal power mode? and is Low Power mode recommended for a heavy task like Davinci/PS?"
2024-08-16,"It really depends on the task. If you‚Äôre doing heavy work, the battery will drain pretty quick. (I‚Äôve never used low power mode, in short, doing heavy work = 3-6 hours max, word processing work or leisurely can = 10+ hours)

For example let‚Äôs say photoshop or canva to make a couple of social media posts, it‚Äôll last you a decent amount of time. maybe even throughout the day.

However if you have a timeline full of 4k videos, with edits and grades, or large illustrator files (illustrator really makes it chug) it can drain within just a few hours. 

What i did is got a tiny 60w GAN charger I carry around that charges my macbook if needed and my iphone (usb c) which helps when needed. 

Hope I was able to help, I can also answer any other questions you got :)"
2024-08-18,"I was thinking of getting the m3 pro 14 inch too, but wondering if the pc is overheating quickly?"
2024-08-18,"Just like my previous answer, depends on the task, Photoshop, Canva, Microsoft Suite, etc you‚Äôll never run into heat. 

Even heavy tasks like large illustration or indesign documents chug a lil bit run fine. 

The only time i‚Äôve run into lots of heat and the fans blasting was exporting 2 streams of 4k video with grades and edits at once. Which would make any but the absolute strongest machines struggle."
2024-08-19,Thanks for your quick and helpful reply! I missed your other answers
2024-08-25,What are you specs
2024-09-20,"Hi ,need help . Im looking to buy this one to do some canva and learn some video editing. I dont want to purchase again in the next 5 years, is this the one you are using ? Im looking to get refurbished from apple at around 2.2k usd. Any inputs?

2024-09-20,"If the goal is Canva and video editing, personally i‚Äôd go for the base M3 Macbook pro so you could reap the benefits of way better battery life, while still getting the same physical Macbook pro with the brighter screen and fans (compared to the airs). 

It will preform more than enough for those tasks and have a ton of overhead for pro level tasks over more than 5 years as well! along with better battery life and save a decent chunk of change."
2024-09-20,The basic is also good enough to edit 4k video? My goal is not to buy any new laptop in the next 5 years.

2024-09-20,"Yes to both, even the Macbook air M1 is capable of editing 4k video, this model should be cheaper, have better battery life, and last you well over 5 years! (esp since you found one with 16gb ram and more storage!)"
2024-09-20,"Now, I'm torn with 16 inches m2 pro. Is this a good choice too? Anything bad about the size? Price about 2.2k usd

2024-04-20,"Yes, Intel CPU‚Äôs."
2024-04-20,"Ah I see, how far is it by comparison?"
2024-04-20,yes
2024-04-20,how trash is it by comparison?
2024-04-20,"they get hot and loud, performance may decrease because of that

I use an m1 air which has no fans, it stays cool and silent no matter what I do (I don't do video rendering or anything like that)

but the most important thing in my opinion is the silence"
2024-04-20,wdym no fans?
2024-04-20,[https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/eIi44fP1clanGHWQ.huge](https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/eIi44fP1clanGHWQ.huge)
2024-04-20,holy shit literally no fans
2024-04-20,What‚Äôs your 2019 laptop‚Äôs specs like?
2024-04-20,"should be this one 
https://support.apple.com/en-sg/111948"
2024-04-20,That‚Äôs a 8G memory - low for memory intensive work like photoshop and lots of multitasking. Not an expert but you might be better off with the current laptop - just be discipled enough to ‚Äòclose‚Äô unnecessary applications.
2024-04-20,"the thing is the 6-9 windows of application is needed, because I need to compare the documents. I tried cutting all windows and it went down to 3-4 applications in order to make my macbook work properly. This is excluding finder, safari, and spotify which I need all the time"
2024-07-04,"I‚Äôve been using 14‚Äù MacBook Pro M3 Pro for a few weeks now and can attest that the battery sucks. Reason: I bought it as a replacement for a 2020 13‚Äù MacBook Pro M1. That M1 easily lasted 15 hours when new, and still lasts more than 10 hours with ~85% battery health. Now this brand new M3 Pro lasts about 8 hours of intensive work, or about 10-12 hours of casual browsing. Sure, it‚Äôs bearable, but can‚Äôt get over a feeling of a downgrade (though the performance is better than M1 of course)

P.S. Don‚Äôt want to think how its battery will perform in 1.5-2 years. I hope I‚Äôll trade it in by that time (it‚Äôs just a tool after all)"
2024-08-25,"Ok 2 months in and maybe I exaggerated a little, it doesn't outright suck, it's just 10-15% worse than my wife's M3 and worse than my M1 when it was brand new. Still it lasts me enough to do most of my stuff, but if I'm working intensely I'll get from 100% to 50% in roughly 4 hours, so it would be about time to charge it (I've heard it's recommended to charge when it reaches 50%, then take off the charger on 100% and repeat indefinitely). Feels kinda like 2013-2015 13-inch MbPros back in the day, it's okay."
2024-09-09,"The M3 Pro and M3 Max are equipped with two fans that draw additional power, making these devices potent but also more draining on the battery. In my research on battery aging, I've learned that keeping your phone or laptop plugged in while stationary is beneficial for the battery since it helps you avoid using up its limited charge cycles. My iPhone, now slightly over a year old, still has 100% battery health with just 94 cycles. Additionally, operating your electronics in a cooler environment can significantly extend their lifespan."
2024-07-19,"I‚Äôm in the same boat and have a Mac Air I got back in 2019 on Black Friday. I was wondering if you ended up purchasing the M3 pro version and what you think of its performance. I mostly use office and a data software and even the Mac Air was working smoothly until a few months ago when I noticed browsing with a software open slowed it down, so I‚Äôm contemplating whether to get the Mac Pro M3 with 8gb ram or the M3 Pro with 18gb ram"
2024-08-06,"Hello! I haven't been in this account for so long. Sorry for the late reply. Last time I have decided to purchase the M3 Pro with 18gb ram. It works like a charm. I decided to purchase the M3 Pro because from what the others are saying from forums, youtube reviews, etc; the normal M3 that has 8gb ram is not enough to be used for apps nowadays. Currently the standard for a laptop or PC should be AT LEAST 16gb of ram. Which means u need to upgrade the normal M3 to the 16gb of ram. But at that point you might aswell buy the M3 pro because it gives you much more value with little difference of cost compared to the upgraded M3. Remember that M3 Pro not only upgrades your RAM but also upgrades your chipset. So the price difference is worth it imo. I'm not much of a tech guy but I know the chipsets options in Apple products has a quite significant difference. 

I dont know about the exact app you usually use but the apps I'm using right now is mostly chrome&amp;safari (at the same time), 3-4 docs of ms word that I havent close, 2 excels, spotify, 3 messaging apps, DVR, and photoshop with 3 canvas opened. Just to let you know, I opened my safari and chrome with a lot of tabs. The kind of tabs that only shows the logo because there is too many tabs opened. The macbook is not even lagging and still works like a wonder. It heats up but not loud, which means its still can handle more applications. And also maybe because it is still several months of use, everytime I open my photoshop app, it only loads for less than 1 second. These info should give you an approximate of how fast this spec is."
2024-08-15,I‚Äôm buying one tomorrow. Good buy?
2024-08-20,yeah good buy buddy. fkin worth it in my side
2024-08-20,They just dropped to $1499 I copped it
2024-09-05,"Tysm!! My workload tasks are definitely more limited than yours so I should be fine. And I think you‚Äôre right, I saw the m3 pro on sale at Bestbuy so it seems like a great deal for an extra couple of hundred bucks"
2024-08-23,Did you Mac book air have 8gb of ram or 16gb?
2024-09-21,Mine was 8gb which I believe was or still is the limit for the Air models
2024-04-20,"i have the Macbook Pro(M3) 8Gb RAM, 516 SSD, and its working fine for me, fits my needs, no lag, battery is perfect, im happy with it. Everyone keeps claiming 8Gb RAM aint enough, but its just enough for me, i can normally have up to 4-5 apps and no lags. So as the 516 SSD, i dont store photos on here or videos, so its enough for me. If ill ever need to ill just get an external, but i dont think i will cuz i dont needs photos and videos on my laptop, i have them on my phone, and if i need them on my laptop ill just airdrop the one i need,. I just used the storage to store my documents mostly, im not really much of a heavy pc user, the most i would do is just stream movies/youtube, listen to music, i dont game on pc, i prefer console"
2024-04-21,yea. i do have pc and consoles to play game aswell. My PC is even more than enough to use all these apps. But I travel alot so I need a powerful laptop
2024-08-20,"Omg this answers many questions.  I have a 2019 MacBook Pro with i5 2.4ghz 8gb 256gb and I‚Äôve had similar issues as you.  It‚Äôs been lagging but not dying.  I use it for chrome, notion, streaming music and video, and zoom calls.  I often have multiple tabs and multiple windows in chrome.   My biggest reason for considering this vs a less powerful laptop is the native +2 external display support that the pro chips have. I kind of feel like my use case otherwise might be complete overkill to buy this computer. But it seems like your situation in mine aren‚Äôt vastly different. And that‚Äôs encouraging."
2024-08-29,2019? I had a 2015 running perfectly until Apple broke it during a battery replacement ü§ì
2024-09-09,"Just wondering if they replaced it for you, or at least compensated you."
2024-08-02,M3 pro 18gb VS 36 gb? I have same workflow with OP. Is 18gb enough or might as well add a bit more for 36gb?
2024-08-06,"Hello, currently I opened safari and chrome at the same time with a lot of tabs until you can only see the logo, 3-4 ms doc, 2 excels, spotify, 3 messaging apps, DVR, photoshop with 3 canvas opened. The macbook still works fine and no lagging whatsoever. It heats up but nowhere to the point that it is unhealthy. The fan is not even loud at all, you can barely hear the fan. If anything I think it still able to handle much more applications than what I currently open. 

So I dont think you need to add more RAM to this. This much should be more than enough already. 36gb is a damn lot, I think if you are planning to buy the 36gb, better purchase the M3 Max instead."
2024-08-09,Thank you! I ended up getting the 18gb. I figured it‚Äôd be fine since I kinda did the same thing (work with a gajillion tabs) in my old base M1 unit. I‚Äôm planning to do some light video editing. Excited to see how it‚Äôll hold up.
2024-10-11,Im a big fan. Never any problems. Never gets hot and very long battery

2024-04-20,No
2024-04-20,whhy?
2024-01-02,"8GB is not enough RAM. 

When you spend $200 to get to 16GB, you likely won‚Äôt get any discounts, so it‚Äôll cost about as much as a discounted M3 Pro 18GB. ($1,800 for an M3 Pro is not hard to find.)

So yeah, it‚Äôs not a great deal. If they sold it with 16GB, it would be a perfectly fine machine."
2024-01-03,"If the price really matters, get a refurbished M1 Pro or M2 Pro."
2024-01-03,"This is just the trap set up by Apple though. They put the price ranges so close together you start justifying. Well I got 16gb ram on the base m3 and it‚Äôs now $1800, I might as well spend the extra $200 for the m3 pro at 2k. So on until you get a m3 max"
2024-01-03,"You don‚Äôt understand: Shelf configurations are regularly discounted. You can buy an M3 Pro 18/512 for $1,800 easily.

Build to order configurations are usually (not always) full price.

So we‚Äôre talking about potentially THE EXACT SAME PRICE for a 16GB M3, or an 18GB M3 Pro in many cases."
2024-01-03,I got price laddered hard with those sales. $1999 for a 36/512 model. Meanwhile I‚Äôve already gotten pretty deep into swap with 36 lol
2024-01-03,how did you manage to get 36gb with $2000?
2024-01-03,Adorama and B&amp;H had it for that price for about 2 days
2024-01-03,"well fuck me, just dropped 3k on the apple store for a 12/18 36gb config with 1tb. you got a great deal!"
2024-01-02,"it can't be a ""Pro"" model with only 8GB RAM."
2024-01-02,Get something with 16GB memory. Whether it's an M2 Pro or an M2 MBA or an M3. 8GB is not a smart buy.
2024-01-02,You‚Äôre trying to justify not spending more money.  We‚Äôve all been there at some point and we all got a lesser machine for it.
2024-01-03,Not wanting to spend more money is okay. If the price of a basic M3 is the all OP can/want spend I would go for refurbished M1/M2 with more RAM etc.
2024-01-03,... and regretted it. The poor man pays twice.
2024-01-03,Ther is problem with base M3 :) supporting only one external display that is a joke
2024-01-03,"I have this model. I use it for basic tasks like typing and watching movies. It‚Äôs a fantastic machine but it is not worth its starting price. If you can get it on sale for 1300-1400 new then it‚Äôs worth looking at as that is in new M2 air territory (if you spec the air with a 512gb ssd) but the pro has a way better screen, keyboard, speakers, pro-motion etc. I personally don't regret buying this over an air but that is a personal decision and a financial decision. 

You can also look at refurbed M1 and M2 pros if available where you live. Don‚Äôt buy this machine at 1600."
2024-01-03,It makes no sense to sell a notebook with only 8GB RAM and only supports one external display with the price of $1599.
2024-01-03,"The problem is that it overlaps with the MacBook Air which is half the price at the same specs (albeit M3 air isn't out yet). If you want base m3 then wait for the new air or buy the current M2 air which isn't far off because that'll save you half the money and it's half the size. 

If you want a ""Professional"" machine then buy the M3 pro. I don't agree with a lot of people here about the Ram because for what you described you'll not see a difference between 8 and 16. 

I personally own a M3 pro with 36gb RAM and an M2 air with 8gb and I can't tell the difference in performance for everyday use."
2024-01-03,My 2013 MacBook has 8GB RAM. Let that sync in.
2024-01-03,"I‚Äôm not sure what to think y‚Äôall. Everyone here says 8GB isn‚Äôt enough (which is exactly what I thought initially) but I‚Äôve looked at multiple 8GB vs 16GB stress testing videos since posting this and almost all of them conclude that there‚Äôs no noticeable difference even when the machine is being unrealistically pushed, having dozens of open tabs and videos playing while multiple video and photo apps worked simultaneously. 

Either I‚Äôm not understanding that MacBook users have incredible needs that exceed 8GB of RAM (I‚Äôm new to MacBooks), which means they must have 70 tabs open and 29 apps running, or there‚Äôs a misunderstanding in the relevance of RAM in MacBooks particularly."
2024-01-03,"the os itself will take at least 2gb of ram. I have 16gb and constantly getting around 2gb of swap, with multiple tabs open on chrome + firefox and vs code open.

when you make heavy use of swap (ie with 8gb of ram), the ssd is constantly performing read/write operations which will degrade performance and the ssd itself in the long run. that's why everyone here is telling you that spending thousands on a new machinge with 8 gigs is just a bad call. Especially knowing that new applications + OS updates will eat more and more ram as years go by.

no matter how hard you try to justify it, it's not a smart purchase. could you just get by with 8gb for a year or two with low instensity workloads? probably, but at that point why are you buying a pro machine for a non pro workflow? m1 air is more than enough for that sort of usage."
2024-01-03,Tho my Powermac 6100/60AV.  had 8mb of ram. Great computer. Video was a postage stamp at 10 frames per second. It was a little miracle!
2024-04-17,How is slow or fast is your MacBook in 2024?
2024-04-17,"It‚Äôs adequate for web browsing, light coding in Java IDE but YouTube overworks it totally."
2024-04-17,"Is that your primary computer that you‚Äôre currently using?

What is your computer that you‚Äôre using today?"
2024-04-17,"It's my primary personal computer. I use it for light tasks. Most of the day I use my work computer for heavy work tasks.

I use my phone for YouTube, but the computer can handle Amazon Prime fine. YouTube just has a very complicated UI, which offloads a lot of computation to the browser.

YouTube can be used, no worries, but after a while the computer gets hot and sounds like an airplane."
2024-04-17,What MacOS version is your MacBook on?
2024-04-18,I am on the latest Catalina
2024-01-03,"Well it is much better than a base model Intel from 2018!  But only because it doesn‚Äôt get as hot, and the battery lasts much longer, and it has a nicer display, but performance is about the same. 

Apple designed m3 base and pro model MacBooks to have good battery life at the expense of performance! 

If you want a moderate performance improvement at least double the ram and the internal storage. Or an earlier M1 base model, or m2 Pro (not the m2 base which is slower than the m1 base).

If you want the scary performance marketed by Apple you definitely need to either buy an M1 Max, or m2 pro or the m3 max maxed out. 

For the m3 lineup apple is reliant on many binned chips due to poor production yields. So getting the better cpu/gpu configurations boosts bus speed, drive speed, cpu and graphics core performance, and effective overall performance, if only because you get more cores running at optimum performance levels rather than downgraded chips that can‚Äôt meet the reliability standards at their native designed clock speeds. Of course being apple their solution to maintaining profitability is to max out the base model price tag than max out every step up in the lineup until the purchasers eyes and ears begin to bleed dollar signs.  Basically for performance it is a case of buy the best chipset cpu/gpu you can afford, and the base ram and storage config associated with that chipset, then flesh the beast out with fast thunderbolt attached storage from third party suppliers. This will give you at least 32GB of ram (more often these days 64GB, and 512Gb of internal storage, and the faster bus speeds.  If you are buying ram that is not a multiple of 8GB you are buying binned chips (eg. 18Gb or 36Gb is a binned 48GB chipset) and chances are the bus speed is reduced due to the fewer connections within the SoC. 

So the moral is if you want longest possible battery life and marginal performance buy the base model.  Beyond that it is a dogs breakfast of guessing what ‚Äúperformance‚Äù combo best suits your wallet, and need. 
If you want gaming performance your only option is to go for the best unbinned chipset you can find in the apple matrix. And buy only enough ram to run your games Posibly less than imagined if coming from a pc background. Even the 32Gb option is entirely viable because well most games run well with 8GB of CPU allocated ram, and that leaves 24Gb for GPU (see how that unified memory works) and no ram is needed to play juggle around between cpu and GPU on apple silicon so that also enhances effective ram performance a little.  The base models do not benefit very much from apple silicon because they run slower, colder, and communicate poorly with storage, and lack the ray tracing introduced to top tier m3 silicon."
2024-01-03,Settle dowwwnnn
2024-01-03,"It's only bad because it comes with 8GB of RAM. The issue is that by the time you pay for 16GB of RAM, you... probably should just go ahead and get the M3Pro. If battery life is not a concern, then you should probably just get the refurbished (or still new) M2Pro. check the prices in your region."
2024-01-03,"This is what I did. 
M3 MacBook Pro 36GB Ram
512GB SSD.
I did not need more than 512. Because for 750 Dollars. I got a NAS Storage with 8TB of Storage, upgradeable to 126TB of Ram.

Because I don‚Äôt store everything on my computer."
2024-01-03,"Just a rip off marketing scheme. 
400$ to move from 18 to 36 gb of ram of whatever is beyond absurd."
2024-01-03,"Dude, why not just get an M2 pro with better ram and storage and probably be a better bang at the moment . You don‚Äôt always need to go for latest and greatest. These machines release previously are still beasts and not slowing down anytime soon"
2024-01-02,"If you‚Äôre a light user and have no need for multiple monitor support, it‚Äôs probably more than powerful enough for your daily use. The 8GB of RAM and single display support are things that shouldn‚Äôt exist on a ‚ÄúPro‚Äù device."
2024-01-02,yes. It's a marketing stunt targetted towards starbuck sitting wannabes. Save up and get a pro.
2024-05-04,I just want to pitch in and say that I‚Äôve had my base model for a few months now; even with many open tabs and WoW Classic running I‚Äôve never even encountered a stutter.
2024-06-19,"Rubbish laptop just got one 128 gig 12 gig ram I think and it‚Äôs to slow to even edit photos with Lightroom on, was $3000 NZD total waste of money"
2024-01-03,Yes
2024-01-03,You could go M2 Air 16 GB RAM
2024-01-03,"Personally I find the 24gb ram version very intriguing.
Decent price, amazing single core performance and the beautiful mini LED 120hz screen."
2024-01-03,Yes. 8GB is not cutting it for a Pro device. You can get a 16GB M1Pro or M2Pro for a little bit more.
2024-01-03,"How urgently do you need it? I think sales usually happen around March for the MBP. I have 0 idea about music production, but none of your other tasks seem like you need a MBP. For your price range I would consider getting the 15in MBA in the 16GB RAM 512GB or storage configuration. There are quite a few sales for the MBA right now."
2024-01-03,The machine isn't bad but the price is
2024-01-03,"It depends on what you wanna do with it. Why do you want a machine called Pro? Are you actually gonna use it for Pro work (coding, development, crunching AI-ML data, videography etc)? If yes then with 8GB of RAM this otherwise good machine will fail catastrophically. If no, then the only reason to get this over the air is because you want the miniLED screen and better speakers, in which case go for it. Also in the off-chance you want to do a longer load or something having a fan is a hell of an advantage.

Excel and word, this machine is gonna breeze through them like they weren't there. Music production is not my thing so I can't comment on it.

Is it a good machine overall? I would say yes, but not for the price. Would I buy it? No.

And no, I don't think it will last for 5 years with 8GB of RAM. In your shoes I would just get a refurbished M2 Pro for similar money (or even an M1 Pro for that matter, still gonna be a better machine)."
2024-01-03,"Reiterating what has been said. 8 GB is not enough. Multiple Apple reviewers show that audio and video editing apps crash when using 8 GB RAM. Spending $200 to upgrade to 16 GB RAM seems like a no brainier. Even if in theory 8 GB can handle everything you need now, it will likely become a problem in a year or two as applications become more demanding. Think about how long you want to keep your laptop."
2024-01-03,"Can you provide links to these videos? If that‚Äôs true I might just go for the M3 Pro, if these audio and editing apps are crashing without being unnaturally used then 8GB is absolutely not enough and it‚Äôs settled. I also don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be doing more demanding work in 5 years, I‚Äôd like to think so, but I high doubt it."
2024-01-03,You will be much happier getting an m1 pro or M2 Pro with 16 to 32 gigs of ram. Backmarket is the place to go
2023-10-31,Starting with 18GB RAM instead 16 GB interesting
2023-10-31,"Would love to know the technical reasoning behind this change. Also overall memory bandwidth has been reduced to 150 GB/s from 200 GB/s, and is now the same for M3 and M3 Pro."
2023-10-31,"Reviews will tell, it's also possible that apple gonna milk this 3nm with many refreshes M4 maybe even M5 so that reinvent the 200 GB/s into the next ""upgrade"". Tsmc 1nm is still years away if that is even possible. My money is on 3nm++++ versions for years to come"
2023-10-31,"No one is even discussing 1nm, the smallest I've seen on a roadmap is 1.2nm and it is slated for possibly 2027 and the 1.2nm features are limited to certain gating areas inside the processor."
2023-10-31,"It has to do with memory bus width. Reduced from 256 bit to 192 bit means chips in multiples of 3 instead of 4. Hence you get 6,12,18,24 with standard DRAM die sizes."
2023-10-31,But doesn't Apple use Magic RAM? /s
2023-10-31,But why does this only apply to the Pro and Max? The base model M3 still comes with 8GB of RAM. That‚Äôs kinda irritating ü§î
2023-10-31,"It only applies to the pro.
Base is probably 128-bit, (2x 64-bit chips)
Pro is 192-bit (3x 64-bit chips)
Max is 256-bit (4x 64-bit chips)

So base and max operate on multiples of 2/4"
2023-10-31,I see ‚Ä¶ thnx üôèü§úü§õ
2023-10-31,"The binned M3 Max also has its memory in multiples of 3 (36gb or 96gb of unified memory at 300gb/s instead of 48gb, 64gb, or 128gb at 400gb/s bandwidth for the full 40 core gpu)"
2023-10-31,"Yeah, ridiculous at this point that 16GB of Ram isn‚Äôt the standard."
2023-10-31,"Reason is because apple is being apple again and only used 3 x 6BG chip instead of 4x4GB chips like the old ones did. 

Honestly they should have made 4 x 6GB for 24GB of RAM. That would have preserved the 200GB/s and 400GB/sec bandwidth"
2023-10-31,"Thanks! That makes sense, seems very tight not to go with 24GB then, I agree. These new models still seem like a bad deal compared to the original 14‚Äù models. Very happy I don‚Äôt need to upgrade right now. These are not good choices."
2023-10-31,"These can be considered 2024 models‚Ä¶ 8GB RAM in 2024‚Ä¶ really Apple. Is 2 x 6GB that much more expensive than 2 x 4GB.

Typical apple tactic trying to upsell again‚Ä¶"
2023-10-31,"No technical reason, earnings season reasons. Mac sells are down, How do you get people to upgrade? Make them believe they are getting more value."
2023-10-31,"Sounds reasonable but in that case I suspect some hidden cavities except memory to ""push"" us buying M3+++ models later.
M2 still really good alternative for years"
2023-10-31,"Yeah, unhappy to see memory bandwidth go down. Looks like M3 is same as M2 at 100GB/s and only M3 Pro went down from M2 Pro. https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs/"
2023-10-31,"Hmm, what does this change mean practically? 

I do a lot of photography so I use Lightroom and photoshop a lot. I could also see myself in the future wanting to do video 

I was annoyed by how apparently the read and write speeds were slower on the M2 because that‚Äôs the main thing i was excited about when it came to Apple silicon."
2023-10-31,"I‚Äôm in the same user boat as you. All of these machines are past where we‚Äôll see real world gains in Adobe Apps unless you‚Äôre doing very heavy professional work with a lot of batch editing.

I have an M1 Pro Macbook and Dell XPS with dedicated graphics. The Dell is noticeably faster with Lightroom and Photoshop AI actions like the new Denoise AI, but my Mac is far more pleasant to use.

Bottom line, don‚Äôt second guess what you have unless you find it interfering with you productivity or enjoyment. You probably won‚Äôt find a machine that‚Äôs all that much better in the wild."
2023-10-31,"Haha I have a low spec MBP 2015, so I definitely need something new for my use case üòÇ 

I also might be lucky enough to be able to get a MBP 10-15% off, so that makes getting something new as opposed to refurbished much more enticing."
2023-10-31,"I‚Äôd look at the prices of the refurbished M1 or M2 options. Avoid the base model M2s and you‚Äôll avoid the screwy bottlenecks they introduced.

Most photographers doing photo by photo editing and normal Lightroom stuff won‚Äôt notice a lick of difference from M1 MBs. And the discounts will be huge."
2023-10-31,"I‚Äôm also looking to upgrade my 2015 low spec MBP, what do you mean by ‚Äúbottleneck‚Äù? M2 base MBPro isn‚Äôt a good option? Thanks üòÉ"
2023-10-31,"The only bottleneck I know of is the fact that the 512gb option is slower than 1tb and beyond. It‚Äôs not actually as big of a deal as people make it out to be, since this only ever matters in huge file transfers, and the difference is what, 45 seconds max, for transferring the entire capacity? 

Still people felt they were getting cheated out of speed or feeling forced to upgrade storage. It is worth noting as an additional reason to upgrade storage beyond just the capacity however. 

Only the individual can decide whether the ‚Äòbottleneck‚Äô is significant for their use case. Plenty of reviewers have covered the speed differences so anyone can see for themselves.

(Also reason is due to using 1 512 nand chip instead of 2 256 nand on 2021 models)"
2023-10-31,My low spec 2015 mbp is still running strong! üí™
2023-10-31,"Ditto! 16 gig of RAM 500gig hard drive. Editing video and multitrack recording - solid, fast and at times a bit hot but then the fan kicks in ü§£ü•≥. As far as what I am doing and the apps I am using I don‚Äôt see a huge difference between the M1s at my college I work at."
2023-10-31,Non binary ram go brrrr
2023-11-01,All to push buyers towards M3 Max with 300GB/s (max 400)
2023-10-31,Still seems bizarre to me that the barebones doesn't get 16GB... Seeing that 8GB still sitting there with a $1599 price tag blows my mind.
2023-10-31,i really thought they were going to move the base m3 to 12gb. even a 12gb option for $100 would have been better
2023-10-31,"My base 2014 was $1300 and 8gb of ram with 256gb SSD. Basically 10 years later and they are charging $300 more for the same ram, but hey you get more storage now that it has been a decade."
2023-10-31,"I like the new colour. The other stuff was expected, right?"
2023-10-31,Scratches will be as blinding as the sun though on the black haha.
2023-10-31,Why I keep buying silver.
2023-10-31,I always buy silver. But I went ahead and bought the space black this time.
2023-10-31,Silver iPad and MacBooks are the superior color. They just look more classy
2023-10-31,"Yeah the color is nice, hopefully it's not a fingerprint magnet like the midnight colored MacBooks. The other stuff was expected :)"
2023-10-31,They stated in the event video that it would reduce the fingerprints.
2023-10-31,"As someone who bought a ‚Äúfingerprint resistant‚Äù fridge, I‚Äôll believe it when I see it."
2023-10-31,üòÇüòÇ
2023-10-31,"Haha, true. I am curious how much of a change their new process used for painting this new laptop color makes in real-life."
2023-10-31,Wait until they hit the physical apple stores and people's grimy hands all over it. That will be a good indication of what to expect with heavy usage.
2023-10-31,Do you prefer Space Gray or Space Black though?
2023-10-31,I want the black so bad lol
2023-10-31,I would really like to see it in real life to know for sure if I like it more than my current space gray. It looks really nice though on the images.
2023-10-31,I know right? ü§£
2023-10-31,An article on TechRadar said they tried their best to leave fingerprints and couldn't. Make of that what you will.
2023-10-31,I‚Äôm yet to see anything fingerprint resistant actually be fingerprint resistant ü§£
2023-10-31,I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs a small percentage of people that would even need this much power but here we are lol. Congrats to those who can afford these and use it to watch netflix and comment on Reddit lol

2023-12-05,hahahahha
2023-10-31,You ain‚Äôt lieing bro üòÇ
2023-10-31,Some of these suggestion posts are infuriating. But I‚Äôm not gonna be a hater so let them throw their money away lol. It‚Äôs funny how the people who actually use these machines can‚Äôt afford em and the ones who can‚Ä¶ watch Netflix. LOL
2023-10-31,The ones who ACTUALLY need these for work are actually a business expense paid for by company and they aren‚Äôt even thinking about the cost.
2023-10-31,Yep. Just ordered the m3 max. Thankfully the company doesn‚Äôt also care if I play Baldurs gate on it
2023-10-31,"Yep honestly, it‚Äôs the reason I moved from intel to my refurbished m1 pro. Sure I said the ‚Äúperformance needing‚Äù I wanted it for was for simple coding assignments from school, the real reason was Baldur‚Äôs Gate on the go."
2023-10-31,People who can't afford them should just get an M1 or M2. I still can't get my M1 Max to break a sweat or stutter
2023-10-31,The black 14 inch looks dope!  I still have my 2020 14 inch macbook pro and it runs flawlessly. I think I‚Äôll stay with it for at least one more generation
2023-10-31,"Yeah I can't decide. I have late 2019 that runs great usually. There are times where I'm running intensive software that grinds it to a halt, but don't need that software for the next 6 months so may hold off."
2023-10-31,They look great with the new improvements and new color. I was unlucky to buy the M2 Max though recently and now my 14 days of return are just over. I wish I had waited a bit more with my purchase.
2023-10-31,"On the contrary, the M2 Max is an absolute beast of a chip, you would have barely noticed the difference if you would have upgraded to M3 Max. They'll be releasing the M4 in a few months anyways ;) - trust me you'll be fine."
2023-10-31,"I spent ‚Ç¨5600 euros on it just two weeks ago for 96 GB RAM and 2 TB SSD just for them to announce the M3 laptops though, so it feels very unfortunate to me.

During their event, they stated something like a 40% performance increase of M3 Max over M2 Max. Is there really not going to be such a difference?"
2023-10-31,"Unfortunately, they don't have the same RAM configuration in this new generation **~~in the Netherlands (where I bought mine from)~~**. There is only 64 GB RAM and 128 GB RAM, so I am not sure how that would work.

**~~Edit: Since I noticed downvotes on my comment, I made an edit to specify that I checked only the Dutch Apple Store online as I bought my laptop from there.~~**

**Edit 2: I see that for the ""full"" M3 Max, there are only 48, 64, and 128 GB RAM options. But for the ""restricted"" 14‚Äëcore CPU, 30‚Äëcore GPU version, there are 36 and 96 GB options.**"

2023-10-31,Won‚Äôt know until you try! If you go into an Apple Store and are polite then they may let you.
2023-10-31,"Same thing happened to me - they said they would either allow me to exchange the old one and repurchase a new one even though it‚Äôs out of the 14 days, or set up a price adjustment to give me the money difference. Try asking."
2023-10-31,"&gt;they stated something like a 40% performance increase of M3 Max 

They always use a term ""up to"" meaning one in a while, on a specific app, with specific environment etc. I bet real performance increase will be something like 15-20% max"
2023-10-31,"Their performance statements are just marketing. They frame things a certain way to nudge you to a certain conclusion. It‚Äôs psychology. There are speed ups, but not quite as they present it.
Moreover, the performance you get does not depend on hardware alone, the hardware is incomprehensibly fast, it depends on software, too, and today‚Äôs software is generally bad and slow.
Don‚Äôt worry, enjoy your new machine.
And I‚Äôm curious, what do you use 96GB for? Music? VMs?"
2023-10-31,"If you got it from an Apple Store and bought your MacBook Pro M2 very recently (&lt;30days), you can politely ask them to exchange it for the new one. I‚Äôm almost sure they‚Äôll exchange it‚Äîbut the key is to be polite and nice! Best of luck!"
2023-10-31,i asked a few days ago when the event was announced and they said yes on support
2023-10-31,They usually extend to 30 days if you ask due to a new release. Never had a problem.
2023-10-31,"i feel even worse i just purchased an M1 MAX maxed out, and now these things are out smh"
2023-11-01,"Same thing happened to me, I called and they allowed a return! Buying the M3 version now"
2023-10-31,The M3 14‚Äù is a terrible buy. The rest are great
2023-10-31,"Genuine question. So, I‚Äôm probably a mid-level user. I don‚Äôt think I could pull off a spec-ed out Air. I use Stata, R, Python, and parallels, and I‚Äôve been told the lack of fan would mean the Air might have a hard time pulling that off long term. Is there a reason I shouldn‚Äôt do the regular M3 upgraded to 16 GBs of ram for a bit cheaper than the base M3 pro? I sincerely don‚Äôt understand the difference in the chips well enough to know."
2023-10-31,For the extra 200 dollars the M3 Pro is a much faster machine with more ports and another fan
2023-10-31,"I‚Äôm coming from an m1 air to an m1 pro and there are hardly any noticeable performance gains in cpu. Both did all tasks as I wanted. The real upgrade was the screen and the size of the laptop. 

All these options are tailor fit to each peoples needs. Get whatever is the best option for you."
2023-10-31,"I‚Äôll be coming from a 2016 MBP, so they‚Äôd both be a huge upgrade. Would the extra $200 give me a noticeable change in performance and longevity?"
2023-10-31,"Yes. Absolutely. If you are a once a decade upgrader, those extra CPU and GPU cores makes sense."
2023-10-31,I mean it's nice in the sense that you get that beautiful updated display and all the ports of the Pro/Max models
2023-10-31,why? i prefer smaller screen tbh. i'm thinking about getting the smaller screen with max specs.
2023-10-31,"Guy is referring to the base 14"" with just an M3 chip. The base is only 8 GB ram. So for $1600, that's a ridiculous price point."
2023-10-31,that black is calling my wallet out.. even tho i have no need for another MPro so soon
2023-10-31,Hold it steady soldier. There are always better Macs around the corner. Unnecessarily buying laptops will stress our already stressed environment. Sorry for the preaching.
2023-10-31,Spray paint might do the trick ;)
2023-10-31,Rip Space Gray
2023-10-31,What? They stopped space grey? Or they added a third darker shade? Space grey is best!
2023-10-31,"Space grey limited to base M3 14‚Äù, any M3 Pro/Max seems to be Black or Silver per Apple‚Äôs website."
2023-10-31,Damn. That sucks. I love Space Grey.
2023-10-31,"I prefer space gray over this carbon black.
It looks like lenovo thinkpad :(

2023-10-31,Yeah and we don't know how much of a fingerprint magnet the space black is gonna be - but it looks so cool though ;)
2023-10-31,"i think silver overall looks better, just imo"
2023-10-31,"I first saw a physical M2 Pro very recently and hated what the Apple store guy called the shroud (the black behind the keys). I think it looks ugly as hell against the silver (and compared to my silver). Against black you wouldn‚Äôt notice.

I‚Äôd be happy with two options. Silver without the shroud, or black without the scratches/fingerprints. Neither option exists so I‚Äôll probably go with the silver. I can get used to the shroud but I‚Äôll never get used to bright shiny silver scratches next to the ports."
2023-10-31,"Ah, that‚Äôs the part I really like, and I‚Äôm disappointed that it‚Äôs not on the Air."
2023-10-31,You really like the fingerprints and scratches? You can‚Äôt possibly be talking about that shroud! ü§£
2023-10-31,"Well, I‚Äôve never actually taken a good look at someone‚Äôs MBP with a black shroud in person, but I think it looks so much better in photos where the backlight is off. Is it really that bad?

I can see the keycaps becoming shiny seeing as they‚Äôre ABS plastic, but as I exclusively use an external keyboard, I‚Äôm guessing this wouldn‚Äôt affect me.

That is a fair point, though."
2023-10-31,"I don‚Äôt know if the plastic is different on the keys. I consider shiny keys kind of par for the course, normal wear-and-tear. I‚Äôd prefer it if it didn‚Äôt happen but I‚Äôm okay with the fact that it does.

*In my opinion* the shroud gives it a look like it‚Äôs got a wipe-clean cover on, which is appropriate given they call it a shroud. It looks a bit... *other*... like it doesn‚Äôt feel fully a part of the machine. Almost like a disposable part to be replaced. Again, just my opinion and of course design is highly subjective.

To be honest if you like it so much from photos you‚Äôll probably get along with it in person. I didn‚Äôt love the photos."
2023-10-31,I wonder how much better than the M2 they will be. Significant stagnation from M1 to M2. Maybe M3 will be different. It's hard to judge based on Apple's marketing slides. Will have to wait for third-party reviews
2023-10-31,"I totally agree, but by the time those come out and you‚Äôve navigated them all, weighed everything up and made a decision the next ones are so close!"
2023-10-31,"If the hardware shaders or ray tracing is used, a signifiant bump. For everything else, their super-misleading graphs are actually saying it's about 20% up again. So M1 to M2, about 20%, M2 to M3 about 20% - to the surprise of nobody.

(Example: ""Faster ML image upscaling performance in Photomator"" shows an unlabelled baseline Intel, an unlabelled M1 bar, then M2 labelled as ""14.9x"" and M3 labelled as ""17.7x"". While their text is very misleading - that is *not* a 17.7-14.9=2.8x jump! - the bar lengths in the graph are at least reasonable. The difference from 14.9 to 17.7 is just under 19%. I looked at lots of their graphs and they were all like that. Disgusting marketing tactic IMHO, even for Apple.)"
2023-10-31,"Performance increase was to be expected but I like the new color. 

I have an M1 Max in space grey and I do enjoy it (much more than the Intel unibody it replaced), but fingers crossed when I do need to put her out to pasture, the M7 or whatever generation it is has it in this color."
2023-10-31,My wallet thanks Apple for the mild upgrade to M3.  I will be sticking with my M1 Max for the foreseeable future.  I think Apple is kicking themselves for making the M1 too good.
2023-10-31,Typical Apple honestly. They finally release BLACK in 2023 and it‚Äôs some huge story lmao.
2023-10-31,It would be for anything

2023-10-31,What if it's still 8gb. LOL.

2023-10-31,"Terrible buy, 1600 for 8gb ram"
2023-10-31,It‚Äôs literally just there to keep a low entry price after killing off the 13‚Äù MBP.
2023-10-31,"I think it only has 1 fan too, so I'll leave it at that..."
2023-10-31,"Is that stated somewhere on their product specifications? What about the new 16"" laptops?"
2023-10-31,"just check the keynote. it shows the internals. m3 14'' inch has only 1 fan, like some of the 13"" Touch Bar MacBook Pro had."
2023-10-31,Will check it out. Would be interesting to also see if they cheaped out on something else like they did for the SSD chips before.
2023-10-31,"I'm really hyped for the m3 pro model right now but I will probably wait for possible price reductions on Black Friday at retail. Or even refurbished models. I also want to see comparisons vs the m2 pro model, see real world differences, etc before I jump the gun. The space black looks so good, but yeah"
2023-10-31,The fact the base model only gets 8 GB of RAM in 2023 is ridiculous.
2023-10-31,"Fuckkkkk I just bought a M2 Pro MBP 14"" 3 weeks ago. Return period ended a few days ago"
2023-10-31,"me too lmao 4 weeks ago

all good though, they compared stats to m1 for a reason, its not significantly better than m2 pro, atleast from what we know so far"
2023-10-31,Go to Apple there‚Äôs a good chance they will still accept a return because it‚Äôs so close

2023-10-31,"Apple seems to be interested in gaming recently I‚Äôm hoping all the big AAA titles (Cyberpunk, God of War, GTA, SpiderMan, etc.) will eventually come to Mac natively and I want to make sure the M3 Max can handle those"

2023-10-31,"The very unusual step of both the event and the Apple web site's product pages constantly comparing performance to the **M1** not the M2 is very telling (and in the extended info graphs where all three are shown, the labels are very deliberately designed to mislead IMHO and make it look like M3 is much faster vs M2 than it really is - I'll explain that in a separate comment if asked). Gamers ought to find a bit more interesting I guess, but the vast majority of my own workload is CPU-bound, not GPU-bound.

Have Apple ever before advertised a brand new product by comparing its performance to one from *two* generations ago?

So as we expected - a mostly uninteresting incremental update. Pricing ""drop"" on 14"" M3 is disingenuous, since that model replaces the $1499 512GB 13"" but at a higher price point and with no $1299 256GB equivalent.

I was initially relieved at the pricing staying equivalent for the rest of the range, but when I tried to configure anything to match or beat my own M1 Max 64GB, I'm forced into combinations of upgrades that cost a lot more - Apple's enforced upgrade prices are more and more of a ripoff with every passing year that they ask the same amount of money for the ever-cheaper components. M3 introduces no changes here.

Ultimately, for me, it's good news I suppose - I'm very glad I got what I got! The M1 series is still IMHO the best of Apple Silicon in many ways. M2 was faster often only by being hotter at peak and they started nickel-and-diming on the low end model SSDs with single chips when M2 came along.

This all said, the M3 would become interesting to me if I was first and foremost a Mac gamer.

As for the iMac - well, yeah, if you're into those it's nice to have M3."
2023-10-31,"I don't want to see this hahaha, I just bought my M2 Pro earlier this year, this is mind blowing that another update is already on the horizon :("
2023-10-31,That thing is beautiful and perfect but my M1 is still too good to get rid of. Apple goofed by making the m1 too ahead of its time.
2023-10-31,"I like that the new m3 pro chip starts at 18gb of memory instead of 16gb. I'm still wondering if I should opt for upgrading the memory, that extra couple gb feels like I probably wont need to when I'm just using it for lightroom and some very light finalcut pro editing"

2023-10-31,"Absolutely the best laptop I'm never going to buy. As much as I dislike the Touch Bar, the 13"" M1 MBP still gets the job done for me, so I can't justify upgrading."
2023-10-31,Will they be decent for gaming?
2023-10-31,"If you want to game, probably still better off buying a gaming PC or PS5 or Xbox or Switch. The M series chips all basically share RAM with the CPU and GPU, which maybe works on consoles, but is a hard sell until companies want to take it seriously."
2023-10-31,"So the 13 inch macbook pro is no more. It has been merged into the 14 inch macbook pro. Better speakers and display with an M3 chip and a higher price, which apple made it seem like it started cheaper. 

I am happy about this change except for the fact that TouchBar has died. I fucking loved that feature."
2023-10-31,And the fact that at the higher price point it still has 8GB of Ram‚Ä¶ Unreal.

2023-10-31,"Well, I‚Äòm still absolutely in love with my MacBook Pro 14‚Äú with the M1 Pro, so I‚Äôm not that interested in it.
But from what I‚Äôve read is that this chip is, like every other M-Chip, so powerful that only a small percentage of people would really need it.
Plus it‚Äôs a total scam that I would pay 2000‚Ç¨ for a MacBook Pro with M3 and 8GB of ram (what the fuck, Apple?)"
2023-10-31,"I've heared some reviews speak that m3 family supports raytracing. And it's pretty dissapionting, since i bought a 16"" m2 pro 2 month ago. and I am an architect. Is this true about raytracing?"

2023-10-31,I am wondering why the 16'' m3 pro one doesn't have a 1TB default configuration? Do they think ppl use that only need 512GB ?
2023-10-31,"I spent months saving every penny, did all the research, and decided to buy a 13‚Äù Air with a couple of upgrades.

I didn‚Äôt want to buy just before a new one was announced (buying a 2020 Intel Air a month before the M1 was unveiled will make you wary!). I had the money burning a hole in my bank account while the rumours of this event went from maybe, to probably not, to almost certainly not. This is when I bought it.

It would take 10 days to arrive, and I watched it crawl across from China. For some reason I was just watching an MKBHD video that I‚Äôd seen a few times before and spotted something I‚Äôd missed in all my research - the lack of a fan would be a problem for my needs. This and a couple of other factors made me think it was just about worth it to cancel the order and save for a couple more months to get a 14‚Äù Pro with a couple of upgrades.

So I cancelled, no problem. 20 minutes later I see the first hint of rumours that this event was taking place and felt so damned lucky not to have stuck with the Air. 

Now it‚Äôs complicated though, because the M2 I had specced up and saved to buy when I could afford it is no longer available and I think it‚Äôs a better deal than these M3s! Not that I could have afforded to buy it at the time (still couldn‚Äôt), but I‚Äôm having to spend quite a bit more because the options seem to be not enough juice or way too much."
2023-10-31,They'll probably have refurbished options of the M2's going pretty soon if that helps
2023-10-31,"I just bought a 14"" M2pro - 32GB RAM - 1TB hd for $3000 

It's arriving on Wednesday.  Should I return it for the M3pro? I use it for photo and video editing."
2023-10-31,That is higher than retail price
2023-10-31,"Thats the exact specs that I have purchased my my macbook pro with and it was delivered 2 weeks ago. I have initiated my return request, will be getting m3pro 14inch with 36gb ram and 1tb ssd instead."

2023-10-31,"Every year they come out more powerful and faster. I don't even want to spend money on this nonsense anymore. It makes more sense for me to buy a windows whose parts can be upgraded, I can install hackintosh in it."
2023-10-31,"Haven't read about it a lot, but looks like they removed one of the fans from the entry level MacBook Pro 14"". And they lowered the RAM by 8 GB.

In exchange for it costing $400 less.

But it was often on sale as low as $1599 anyway, the same way the AirPods Pro 2 are permanently on sale for $200 unless you buy directly from Apple.

Makes me wonder if the new model will be at an even lower sale price frequently, or if this is the price they always wanted to target and are now doing so officially by cutting the specs and their retail partners will keep it at the official price.

If the latter it seems like a worse deal given that the M1 Pro and M2 Pro 14"" were often 1599-1799 and had the better cooling and higher memory.

I personally liked how the 14"" and 16"" had complete feature parity before and it was just a matter of chosing display size.

Introducing a model that externally looks exactly the same but has a different cooling system seems confusing and sneaky. The could have made it clearer by calling it the 14"" MacBook rather than the 14"" MacBook Pro. I think they did that back in the old days with some of the early unibody MacBooks when they went aluminum and the 13"" MacBook Pro was the same chassis but higher specs. 

Also reserving black for the higher end models when it's available on the MBAs seems like an odd choice.

I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything with my 14"" M1 Pro MBP."
2023-10-31,"I literally bought an M2 14 inch like two months ago. I do not regret it at all, as it will still fulfill my needs  more than enough (I‚Äôm a teacher, I use it for Word, PP presentations via Beamer and mainly just browsing and storing files). But I still feel that I could‚Äôve waited, even though I wouldn‚Äôt notice any difference in performance. Marketing‚Äôs a bitch sometimes üòÇ

2023-10-31,As far as ram way to many people over spend on something they will never use. I‚Äôm a video editor I edited a feature on Final Cut Pro x with a MacBook Pro 16 M2 Max 1 tb and 32gb of ram and I also own a studio with an M2 Max with 64gb ram. I threw everything at them both my memory pressure never got close to maxing out the 32 with Final Cut Pro x let alone the 64 gb lol. We had tons of layers etc I won‚Äôt go into the technical details here. But for a pro laptop I could have pulled the job off with 16 which might have been a bit tight but would have no qualms owning a machine with a portable pro laptop with 16gb ram. But for content creators and I know plenty in my line of work 32 gb is the sweet spot. I‚Äôm sure there are others who might need more. I surmise most think they need more rather than truly need it.

2024-07-20,right at it!
2024-07-20,"And btw, I keep seeing this ad on Reddit that Safari uses fewer resources. When I open only Safari, one tab, it still shows 8.7GB RAM used. Why does a browser with one tab use 8GB memory. That's insane.

The more I use this computer, the more qualms I have with it. Sure, the Apple ecosystem is great, but I don't understand why they made a device that's smooth, slippery, and heavy. This is just asking to be dropped. My work Dell laptop is rubberized, i7, 16GB RAM, and so light that I never worry about dropping it. I wouldn't hesitant to pick it up with one hand. The MBP I wouldn't dare try to lift with one hand in fear of dropping the damn thing."
2024-07-21,"Mac OS will load as much stuff on ram as possible. It doesn't try to save ram If you have it. Load it up and watch your memory pressure. It will compress and manage perfectly well. If is allowing it to stay in ram till you need it. You'll be green. The plain math of counting ram is not a true representation of how fast it manages it.  What tab were you running that sucked 8 gb, sounds like a memory leak.  I have never seen that much from a tab, seems like it's a weird site or keeps loading things/memory leak. 

Apple has always been a design focused company. Form and function. They last longer than most other oem computers and end up being cheaper per year. 

I have no qualms with my machine. I made so many cool things on it and it handles everything. It keeps killing it for me, so I keep taking care of it."
2024-07-20,"I got M3 Max 128gb and it lags too, in After Effects :/"
2024-07-21,"Damn, I‚Äôd blame that on adobe at that point. Or even just the m3 max gpu can‚Äôt handle it"
2024-07-21,8GB hasn‚Äôt been enough for a long time and Apple straight lied to people with the whole ‚Äú8GB on Apple silicon is better than 16GB on Intel‚Äù line
2024-07-21,"I doubt the RAM is the issue- you may have a memory leak going on, but there's nothing you could reasonably do in Affinity Photo that would push an M1 with 8GB of RAM, let alone an M3.

When I got my M1 MBP with 8GB of RAM years ago, I stressed tested it with  
- Diablo 3  
- Ableton Live 11 with a few Serum VSTs  
- Affinity Photo  
- a tab of Chrome with every major streaming service  
- 4 4k YouTube videos in another window of Chrome (I like those long drone footage videos people make)  
- iMovie with 20 minutes of footage (1080p)

...ALL AT ONCE

Diablo 3 hit harder than the rest because it ran in Rosetta, but I didn't really see much lag until then.

Your assertion about high-speed SWAP is absolutely correct by the way- hard drives are so fast now that SWAP is much more useful than it used to be.

As dumb as this sounds, I'd try the basics like turning it off and on again, make sure stuff is up to date, etc., because an M3 should be way, way overkill for what you're asking. A $300 Thinkpad should be easily capable of what you're doing there."
2024-07-21,"woah, I haven‚Äôt had that much app open, maybe I should shut it down. I really haven‚Äôt shut it down since I bought it (always on sleep). I‚Äôll let u know if it‚Äôll perform better. thanks!

btw, how‚Äôs your M1 performing rn?"
2024-07-21,"Well, I traded it in when the M1 Pro came out, and the M1 Pro one bricked on me overnight a few weeks ago lol. I still have an M1 iMac w 8GB going though if you'd like me to test anything.

Idk in full detail what's going on, but a lot of people seem to have this same issue: [https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255211312?sortBy=best](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255211312?sortBy=best)"
2024-07-20,"Maybe it need 32 GB Ram.

If compare your MBP M3 with this MSI laptop which ones is cheaper ?

2024-07-20,"MSI laptops have well known and documented build quality issues even on their premium devices. In particular it's a matter of when will the hinge break, not if. They do not make financial sense to fix, if they can even be fixed."
2024-07-20,"the MSI laptop definitely! but I can‚Äôt let go of the Apple Ecosystem hahaha. I love that I can seamlessly transfer files between my iPhone, iPad, and Mac! Plus I can have my iPad as a second display which is really handy given that I‚Äôm staying at a dorm."
2024-07-20,"Despite what all the Apple fans say, it is insanity that you can purchase a Pro-branded MacBook that comes with only 8 GB of RAM. And it will  cost you upwards of $2K! People need to stop defending this."
2024-07-24,"&gt;And it will cost you upwards of $2K!

You're getting ripped off. M3 with 16GB is $2k (well $1999)."
2024-07-20,Do you think 16 is enough for you?
2024-07-20,"tbh, I think it still doesn‚Äôt"
2024-07-20,"Maybe, you sell it as quickly as possible and you would get a little loss, buy new one with 24 of ram and storage 512"
2024-07-20,"hmm, not really an option for me to upgrade since I‚Äôm still a student (budget issues) maybe I should trade it for 14‚Äù M1 Pro MBP 16/512?"
2024-07-20,Did you change the standard memory settings in Affinity?
2024-07-20,I haven‚Äôt heard of that. can u elaborate? like what does it do and what are the benefits and trade-offs
2024-07-20,works good on my mbp m1....also 8gb but what do u expect with that amount of ram...
2024-07-20,"As others have said, 16GB should be the minimum, and even with that, editing in Photoshop/Lightroom or other memory hungry apps might mean that you need to shut down other apps if you want to avoid memory swapping to the SSD a lot. 

Personally, I tested a MacBook Pro M3 pro with 18GB and it wasn't enough. I usually have Chrome open with 10-15 tabs or so, music/video streaming in the background, my chat apps, and editing in Lightroom. The processor handles all this just fine and very fast, but the memory pressure kept spiking into the red and it was swapping more than I liked. Wound up returning it for a 36GB model and it's perfect."
2024-07-20,Affinity 1 or 2?  Is it optimized for the M series?  Probably not?
2024-07-20,"I'm laying some of the blame on Affinity. Part of my current job has been to come up with alternatives to Adobe products that would reduce the megabucks the company has been paying without substantially disrupting the workflow. 

Affinity was the first option I examined, as a one-time fee for a full creative suite was very attractive. But even on decent hardware, all three of Affinity's apps lacked the pep to keep up. Combined with the learning curve needed for the transition, Affinity had to be crossed off the list. 

I have a personal copy of the suite that I keep updated and will check on every so often. It's on my MBP with an M3 Pro chip, and Publisher and Photo are still laggy."
2024-07-20,do u think it has something to do with the architecture of m series chip or the lack of optimization of affinity and adobe?
2024-07-20,"The M3 Pro Base is such a better deal, 18gb RAM and it‚Äôs not that much more expensive"
2024-07-20,i remembering complaining to my friends that my 8gb ram macbook pro is not enough back in 2013 lmao. it‚Äôs 2024 and 8gb is still not enough and not for the price u r paying
2024-07-21,Return it. Get a better spec m1 mbp
2024-07-21,Like u/samj I fell for that BS with the M1 MBP. Bought the 8gb because ‚Äú8 gb on the m series is like 16gb on intel.‚Äù Hogswollop. Within a month I was getting stuttering and occasional low memory errors from the OS. Would have returned it for a better model but I‚Äôm in a country like you where no returns are possible.
2024-07-21,"You said yourself‚Ä¶ it worked well until you started pushing it. 

It‚Äôs designed for most people‚Äôs day to day use. No point telling others not to get it when your use case requires more RAM and you didn‚Äôt equip yours with it"
2024-07-24,It‚Äôs honestly really sad to me that laptops are being sold with 8GB of RAM in 2024 - be it Windows or Mac. 16GB should be the minimum.
2024-07-20,"My wife used a base 2018 mini and I just replaced it with a 16 GB M1 mini. I had asked her many times if she wanted an upgrade and she always said no. Her comment on the M1 mini is that it's a lot more responsive. I'd say that the vast majority of people that do light, casual computer stuff can get by with 8 GB of RAM. If you do more than the basics, though, you'll want more.

It could be folks that want a better screen and speakers but are otherwise only using it for casual use."
2024-07-20,That‚Äôs why everyone is questioning why is Apple giving 8GB as base model when it is not enough for current normal workload.
2024-07-20,8GB Macs should have been discontinued a decade ago.
2024-07-20,They hadn‚Äôt even discontinued 4GB macs
2024-07-20,"It is superior to Air with its screen and ports. I would still get it and enjoy. However, if you are doing intense work makes sense to get a higher configuration"
2024-07-20,"You should know better and I would have just opted for he next step up which has a better chip, 18gb. How many times do you have to read this sub!"
2024-07-20,"Rumor is Apple Intelligence will need about 2GB of RAM, it's why the older model iPhones aren't going to enjoy it - because they have 6GB - only iPhones with 8GB or more will. I wonder if folks with laptops with 8GB are going to feel the squeeze too? It will run, but it's going to eat up a lot of space to keep those models in memory. At least that's what I have heard -- I don't know if that's true though.

I can't imagine in today's age any laptop with less than 16GB (that seems like table stakes now). My new laptop I got has 32GB, which is like ""middle"" spec."
2024-07-20,Why can‚Äôt you return it? I thought apple had a generous policy
2024-07-20,"I'd have to check, but I swear my base M2 has 16, did they make the M3 worse?"
2024-07-20,Why i went with the max ram stock i could find
2024-07-20,good 4 u!
2024-07-20,You made your bed‚Ä¶
2024-07-20,"That‚Äôs why I jumped at the deal of M3 Pro MBP with 16GB/1TB at $1422 couple of months back. Even if the fan runs fast and gets a bit hot when running AI/ML tools like Junyper or Anaconda, but this thing is a beast for my daily use."
2024-07-20,"yep , as a dev 8GB RAM is unacceptable, in my country I was able to get a brand new 14 M1 max 32GB for less than base M3 pro ."
2024-07-20,They still sell a MBP with 8 GB RAM? üò≤ Swap memory is just a last resort; it has always been horrendously slow.
2024-07-20,RIGHT? the love-hate relationship I have with apple lol
2024-07-20,"I'm truly ashamed that Apple sells their latest MBP with 8GB. It's supposed to be Pro :-(

u/Legitimate-Coconut79 are you able to return it? And get a 16GB MBP or 16GB Air?"
2024-07-20,"8GB of ram on a modern computer is comically low. ¬†Even my MacBook Pro from 2017 has 16gb of ram, and most desktops i build these days have 32gb for a low end configuration."
2024-07-20,"Honestly‚Ä¶ I know more GB is better, future-proofing and all, but I have a base model MBP M2 and I use the entire Adobe creative suite daily and extensively for graphic design and video editing, and for me it‚Äôs just great, it‚Äôs flying through every single task. Take this information however you want, but for me, working on it is just so enjoyable."
2024-07-20,"Meh, I use it and enjoy it"
2024-07-20,"Swap memory works fine for a lot of things, but definitely not if you start throwing programming and heavy photo editing, and video editing at it. That‚Äôs definitely in the ‚Äúneed at least 16GB territory.‚Äù See if you can return it and get one with 16GB."
2024-07-20,"8GB of ram in 2024 lol Even for my M1Pro I took 16GB and when I buy the next one, I will take 32GB minimum"
2024-07-20,"Some boomer needs to get their caps lock privileges taken away for a while. Don‚Äôt tell me what to do. (This is sarcasm, I empathize with your plight‚Ä¶)

Btw, I have an OG 13‚Äù M1 MBP with 8GB of RAM and love the little bastard. It does everything I want and has battery life for days. People should have the option and understand what it can and can‚Äôt do."
2024-07-20,"8gb, what were you thinking?"
2024-07-20,"i liked M3 macbook pro, nothing wrong with it. it‚Äôs not the air in disguise, you just bought the wrong ram"
2024-07-20,Is this the laptop you just sold me yesterday?
2024-07-20,"If you have to upgrade to 16GB anyway, you should just get a M3 Pro MBP that comes with 18/512 standard.  It‚Äôs ridiculous to spend $200 per RAM and storage upgrade step for MBAs or the base MBP from their base 8/256 configurations and you‚Äôre still stuck with objectively inferior hardware."
2024-07-20,"I had two options 1499$ 24GB RAM 1TB 13inch M3 MBA or 1800$ M3 PRO MBP 18/512 
I went with M3 Pro NEVER EVER THINK BELOW 16"
2024-07-20,You spent so much extra for 1TB of storage but couldn‚Äôt bother paying to get more RAM?
2024-07-20,"yeah, this is why I was avoiding the cheap/base M model best buy sales. Sticking to 16gb intel which is slow at processing but holds alot in memory even though its 16GB DDR3. They really should make 16GB the base M's and 24/32 for the high spec. Saving up for the upcoming M4 with at least 16GB if not higher ram."
2024-07-20,Yes I bought a base model MBA M2 with 8GB of RAM and it was not enough. Now I have a M3 Pro MBP with 36GB of RAM and its much more comfortable!
2024-07-20,8 Gb of RAM was not enough for anything even in 2016.
2024-07-20,"I got my m3 MBP a few weeks ago, I was initially interested in buying M1 MBP or M2 MBP, waiting for a long time on Apple Store, always displays that m1 and m2 were out of stock, I eventually went to Best Buy and asked the staff there if I could get a M1 MBP. Long story short, they have it, but the whole staff there were trying so hard to persuade me to get a M3 MBP instead, quote by one of the staff there‚Äù Idk what yt video you watched but M3 is better bcz that‚Äôs the latest and it does have AI.‚Äù I eventually gave up and get an M3 MBP bcz that‚Äôs the only model w Apple care üôÇ"
2024-07-20,"Sell it and upgrade? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I bought the 18gb ram with 1tb M3 and I actually got the message ‚Äúyour system has run out of memory, please close these programs‚Ä¶‚Äù running Adobe suite photoshop, I design and illustrator with Safari‚Ä¶ had a 16gb RaM 2017 intel and I NEVER got that message running the same apps. So yeah, something fishy‚Ä¶"
2024-07-20,are u serious?? maybe apps like photoshop and such are still not optimized for M series chips? since m series chip uses different architecture than intel‚Äôs right?
2024-07-20,"This what I thought, someone with more knowledge about this than me can weigh in. Now I have to quit my apps and use a ‚Äúmemory scrubber‚Äù before ai open any big intensive files (and there are a few of them)"
2024-07-20,someone should make a video about it!
2024-07-20,"The 8gb ram MacBook is for casual users only. What you are working with Photo editing, you definitely need a one with 16GB RAM at least. I would suggest you make an Apple care appointment to see if you can exchange it for baseline M3 Pro MBP. Its baseline version has 18GB RAM by default. 

I myself was going to buy M3 Pro MBP baseline version. But i got a pretty sweet deal for 2019 MacBook Pro with Intel Core i9 2.4GHz, 32GB RAM, 1 TB SSD for 900 USD with 90 days warranty. Really happy with the purchase."
2024-07-20,I have run Adobe Photoshop and Affinity Photo on MBP M1 8gb and everything is okay
2024-07-20,"I bought the 36GB 2TB Max and it gets crazy laggy with photoshop and illustrator; hope Adobe can figure out how to use the hardware, it‚Äôs worse in some ways than my late-2014 16GB 500MB MacBook, I don‚Äôt get it."
2024-07-20,"apparently a lot of adobe apps have an issue on apple silicon that are addressed (or are being addressed) in the macOS Sequoia beta(s). i have a base 14‚Äù M3 Pro for work that i was working in Lightroom CC on a while ago and it would lock up every 15-20 seconds or so. quitting and reopening lightroom would buy me a couple minutes of smooth performance but then it‚Äôd be back to tripping out again. fingers crossed macOS Sequoia actually fixes it, since adobe doesn‚Äôt appear to be doing anything about it"
2024-07-20,you're missing the other 90g of ram to be productive
2024-07-20,"Yea, like others said 8gb was the mistake. I‚Äôd try to see if I could sell the Mac and recoup most of the money, then buy another Mac with 16gb ram. Even something like a M1 Pro with 16gb ram would perform better."
2024-07-20,"I was just futzing around the other day and was using 21 gigs of ram, can‚Äôt imagine being stuck with the base 8"
2024-07-20,"u wouldn't want to experience it, bro"
2024-07-20,I was able to by a 18g 513 m3 pro mbp for like 1699 pre tax. Way better deal.
2024-07-20,"Affinity Photo it‚Äôs not Optimized. I wouldn‚Äôt judge a device from the experience with it. I have a very good desktop and affinity software works like üí©. 
Test it with Lightroom.
Or with Capture One"
2024-07-20,"No shit man, 8gbr is ass for anyone who does any moderate/heavy work loads// allocating ssd for ram is okay in theory but the results are terrible"
2024-07-20,proven ‚Äòn tested
2024-07-20,8GB of ram is killing you. CPU and gpu wise it is fairly solid as an entry point in the M3 lineup.
2024-07-20,Someone needs to put every single configuration side by side and do a speed test on it.  Because right now no one seems to know what to do with all these configurations or maybe that‚Äôs the point.
2024-07-20,Don‚Äôt beat yourself up too much op. Apple are jokers for selling computers with 8GB of RAM using a ‚ÄòPro‚Äô moniker.
2024-07-20,Agreed! 8GB of RAM is borderline unusable in my experience. I had an 8GB m1 Mac mini and that machine would regularly beachball when doing anything even remotely demanding. Safari and iMovie would show significant memory pressure. DO NOT settle for the 8GB variant. 16/18GB should be treated as the minimum.
2024-07-20,Yeah 8gb ain‚Äôt gonna get you far these days.
2024-07-20,We‚Äôve been saying that for months. Fanboys defend Apple like their lives depend on it. Get the m3 pro 18gb model on sales for $1700. Love mine
2024-07-20,Never 8.
2024-07-20,"never say never, jk"
2024-07-20,8GB ram with 1TB drive is too funny.
2024-07-20,M3 Pro 18gb of ram here.
2024-07-20,Why would you buy a pro FOR PRO USE with 8 Gb?..
2024-07-20,I‚Äôve got the same laptop as OP and have been using Photoshop and Lightroom at the same time with Chrome opened with seven tabs and it runs fine. I mean I edit sports stuff so maybe each image isn‚Äôt as resource hogging but still - it‚Äôs been fine.
2024-07-20,"I have the same model but with 24gb ram, yes 8gb is not enough."
2024-07-20,used photoshop on m1 air 8gb and everything worked fine
2024-07-20,You can return up to 30 days after purchase!!
2024-07-20,"I bought the M3 version, but maxed out the RAM to 24GB. I did it more for future proofing than anything else, but yeah buying 8GB RAM (even on the MacBook Air in 2024) is not something I would recommend."
2024-07-20,Have you returned it yet?
2024-07-20,One day they will make 8GB obsolete (maybe?)
2024-07-20,yeah don‚Äôt do it if you plan to do anything more than you would with a chromebook
2024-07-20,"My MacBook M3 Pro with 16GB RAM is struggling!!‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm merely doing playback on Filmora and my CPU is bottlenecking!!

2024-07-20,Bro 8gb in 2024? Come onnn
2024-07-20,"im kinda in the same spot as you, bought the same MPB and only realized my mistake after i got it, different from you i couldve returned it, but budget is a matter, mainly bc Im in brazil lol, the base MBP was around here is ~$2,6k and i got it for $2k
i also work with programming but i havent been running any VMs so my xp thus far is good"
2024-07-20,"I, too, purchased the same machine as a spare to my M1 8TB, and prefer to.use it instead when using Photoshop. It absolutely rips through many (130+) images uploaded from raw in Bridge to jpgs in PS. Generative Fill is, at least, three times faster than the M1."
2024-07-20,"You use the Affinity and you bought a Mac with only 8 gigs of RAM? Dude, most people who use professional apps know they use a lot of RAM. Why the heck would you think 8 gigs is enough for complicated work flows? Most people aren‚Äôt using pro apps.

2024-07-20,"I keep telling people that in the current state of the art, even if you are a casual video editor, graphic designer, etc, someone that does more than the average joe, you should aim for 32gb of ram.

2024-07-20,"This is why I hate when people say ‚Äú 8gb with apple silicon is 16gb on intel‚Äù  ram is ram, when you run out you rely on swap and memory compression which will eventually become noticeable. SSDs are not as fast as ram, and memory compression is only so good because it takes a hit on cpu cycles to compress and uncompress not to mention compression is only so efficient depending on the data"
2024-07-20,Don't buy any Macs with only 8GB - regardless of what Apple tell you.

2024-07-21,"when people say that 8ram on Mac is like 16 on a windows, it isn't"
2024-07-21,8 GB is useless in 2024. Horrible purchase.

2024-07-21,"In my experience, swap does not get read/written to at 7-8 GB/s as you would expect. So loading and unloading the swap takes a lot longer. It‚Äôs not even close to being a substitute for RAM"
2024-07-21,You haven't been able to upgrade the ram on a MacBook laptop since what? 2013/2014. So like...10 years.
2024-07-21,I don‚Äôt really know what to comment. We‚Äôve been saying for ages - 8GB is 8GB. In order to do anything else other than browsing the web you‚Äôll need more than 8GB of ram.
2024-07-21,"I have an 8/256 GB M2 Air, 16/1 TB M2 Air and a 36/1 TB M1 Max.

I returned a 16/512 GB M2 Pro.

For video editing, 16 GB RAM still uses RAM swap, which is bad because it degrades your hard drive. Somehow, Apple has been able to convince customers that RAM swap is industry standard and best practice.

RAM is so bloody cheap $12 for a stick. The only reason why Apple would go with 8GB of RAM in Silicon MacBooks and make the RAM and hard drive irreparable is so that there are *higher possibilities of customers ruining their MacBooks faster requiring complete replacement*.

AppleCare+ doesn't cover replacement if your model is obsolete, only repair.

If your MacBook can't be repaired or replaced under AppleCare+, you'll receive a partial refund of your AppleCare+ agreement.

My 8/256 GB can barely cope with Google applications. I like a lot of Chrome tabs open. It's simply not as snappy as my 2015 MacBook Pro 16/512 GB.

In my opinion and having built my own desktops, RAM is the single most important component relevant in day to day tasks. There should be a class action that 8GB MacBooks are not fit for purpose in 2024, which includes onboard AI and simple video editing."
2024-07-21,"hundred percent true! I think in today‚Äôs tech, RAM has more effect on one‚Äôs workflow than any other computer component. especially if it‚Äôs 8GB only"
2024-07-21,Yet people publicly defend the base M3 MBP lmfao where‚Äôs your ‚Äú8GB on Mac is like 16GB on Windows‚Äù now
2024-07-21,8gb of ram in 2024 is criminal
2024-07-21,You got the worse version of the iPad Pro
2024-07-21,Why would you think swap memory solves a RAM problem?
2024-07-21,Never go with none pro or max ‚Ä¶
2024-07-21,will do next time
2024-07-21,Try to always get 36 gb
2024-07-21,"36/512 with M1 Pro is a better machine, isn‚Äôt it?"
2024-07-21,Every review video I have seen on macbooks has recommended any of them 16gb or up
2024-07-21,P
2024-07-21,"Then honestly, maybe you shouldn't have gotten a MacBook? In the current market, you can get way better specs in a Windows laptop. 
Apple is still a luxury product, and you're knee capping your user experience trying to deal with 8 Gigs of ram anyways.
Would it not be smarter to get a nice Windows laptop that runs whatever you want to throw at it?"
2024-07-21,"And to add insult to the injury, Mac apps tend to hog more memory and storage than their Windows counterparts. I‚Äôm talking about apps natively compiled for Apple silicon. 

In my case (data analytics using R), the very same code, running on the same dataset on the same IDE and the same compiler version would use 1.5 GB RAM on Windows and 5-5.5 GB on macOS.

You would want at least 16GB RAM for EVERYDAY usage, and 32-64GB if your use case is memory-intensive."
2024-07-21,i still believe the m1 pro took the cake!
2024-07-21,the best bang for the buck!
2024-07-21,best bang for anything and everything
2024-07-21,"the question I have is that if you do a 5 minute search you will see all over the place that 8GB although good for browsing and movies , is not intended for something else.  
SO what drove you to buy this model instead of a 16GB with 512 disk for example?"
2024-07-21,Yeah I made the same mistake with the M1 Mini. Sold it on eBay shortly after and upgraded. It was unusable.
2024-07-21,"... So the real LPT here is ""Don't buy Apple products from authorised resellers in &lt;insert OP's country here&gt;"""
