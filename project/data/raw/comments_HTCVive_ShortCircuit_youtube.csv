2023-03-31,"To see more of Riley's Unsolicited Tech Tips, buy things from dbrand: http://shortlinus.com"
2023-03-31,I love how confident they always are that the editors will save them from their mistakes.
2023-03-31,"It's not a proper Quest competitor at $1200. Quest Pro, maybe. But Quest 2? Nah

Edit: Now it seems a little more pointless with the Quest Pro's price drop"
2023-03-31,8:13 Just want to say that the index is a lower resolution of 1440*1600 per eye vs. the 1920*1920 per eye of this headset. (The valve index does have a larger FOV though).
2023-03-31,Shout out to the musician actor at Vive's booth! He reminds me of classic E3
2023-03-31,I want to watch 2 hours of riley giving strangers tech tips.
2023-03-31,"The adjustable diopters feature is SO GOOD. I wear glasses and have bought aftermarket lenses for my prescription for my Quest 2, but that reduces the FoV and my prescription changes slowly over time. Having adjustable focus in the headset fixes both those issues. I would happily pay a good chunk more for those features, but $1,099 with the same chip as the Quest 2 and only 90Hz...oof."
2023-03-31,This would be amazing if it also had eye tracking for foveated rendering like the Quest Pro and PSVR 2 -- really sounds like that'll be a must-have for high performance VR rendering in the future.
2023-03-31,"I like his nervous look to the HTC rep off screen when he says ""don't lie HTC..."""
2023-03-31,"You can't say it competes with the quest 2 when it's twice the price, thats like saying the 7900x competes with an 13500."
2023-03-31,"Holy shit, whatever marketing guru greenlit that French composer for CES is a bloody genius."
2023-03-31,Having a diopter or whatever it's called built in is really cool.  Safe to say a lot of people who don't even wear glasses might be able to benefit from being able to make slight adjustments.
2023-03-31,"I'm a little surprised no one is really saying much about this headset only having an XR2 gen 1, as a quest 2 owner it's apparent that the XR2 has aged a bit, and while it's still a great processor for VR, it was already fleeting in 2020 when the Quest 2 released. We are now in 2023 and this brand new headset has technology that is at least 3 years old. For a headset that costs $1099, you aren't really getting much longevity. You are getting a nicer device, absolutely, but HTC should have waited for XR2 Gen 2 or XR3, especially at this price point."
2023-03-31,"Would a lav mic give better audio for in-conference coverage?
Also, PROPS for calling them out on the resolution thing, that's what we call journalism!"
2023-03-31,"""You're not going to be locked into the Oculus ecosystem and have to use a hacky workaround to play your SteamVR games.""

But that's not the case with Oculus headsets.  They're officially supported by SteamVR the same way the Vive and Index are..."
2023-03-31,I'm glad HTC is still making VR headsets. This one looks like a decent return to form after they floundered for a few years post Valve partnership.
2023-03-31,"You don‘t need a hacky workaround to connect the Quest to Steam. When the Quest is connected to your PC, Steam VR recognizes the headset immediately."
2023-03-31,I love the glasses thing but at $1100 I'll be buying something else with a glasses spacer or an extra lens for it.
2023-03-31,"Dude, finally a headset that isn't locked behind an account wall. Steam is the only place besides Epic Games to download any game period except for Gamejolt where you can download a game without account based requirements. Steam and Epic games is that but have massive libraries to the point everyone just has a Steam account... And also everyone has a Microsoft account because Windows is the only platform anyone could imagine using on a PC not know Linux Mint exists. I might actually buy this."
2023-03-31,"Boy I hope that title is meant to be ""a real quest PRO competitor""

Because at over twice the price of the quest 2 this is not competition

That's like saying a Honda civic is competition with a Lamborghini"
2023-03-31,"You told HTC not to lie about resolution and then you liked about the resolution. You said the Valve Index has higher resolution, but it's only 1440x1600 per eye while the HTC Vive XR Elite is 1920x1920 per eye. That's a significant improvement. It's almost identical to the Quest 2 resolution of 1920x1832 per eye, but still is technically higher. Especially when you consider that the Quest 2 uses a single screen instead of two screens and some of the pixels are out of view."
2023-03-31,"The Meta Quest 2 (2020) offers a 120Hz refresh rate compared to the 90Hz HTC Vive XR Elite (2023). Both headsets use the old Snapdragon XR2 with active cooling. 
Later this year the XR2 Gen 2 is expected with up to 3x GPU performance jumping from 7nm to 4nm."
2023-03-31,God I love how much Riley hated doing those ad segments
2023-03-31,"Some major stuff that others probably mentioned: The headset is not native SteamVR - it's compressed just like the Quest 2. Also, Index has a lower resolution than the XR Elite."
2023-03-31,i wish he would stop calling me guitar
2023-03-31,The glasses diopter thing is absolutely the biggest selling point of these to me and a bunch of others. Still expensive but if the diopter works well…absolutely nothing beats that
2023-03-31,Jeez man can you guys throw Nvidia Broadcast at this audio or something? I get it's busy but there is a TON of background noise. You guys have been great about that in all of these videos of CES. But this one was brutal lol.
2023-03-31,"I think they definitely win in the coolest looking headset category, these oversized aviators look way cooler than those chunky brick or shapeless Blob designs of most other headsets. (Rift S was pretty dope too imo)"
2023-03-31,"This is crazy, instead of making a better headset than the quest2, they make something that is equal, but costs three times as much.
For example, why does nobody make a standalone headset, that you can also connect to a pc, without streaming the picture as a video, so your gpu has to work on additional workload? That would be a nice feature."
2023-03-31,"Man I do love that there is another option, but the issue is that Facebook is the only budget option. VR is going to continue to be dominated by Facebook until we get budget options for VR from other brands. I love VR but I refuse to use Facebooks machine, and I can't really afford these 1000$+ machines."
2023-03-31,A $1100 headset competing with a $400 product? Really? They played you guys for fools.
2023-03-31,"While I do like the dial for glasses, ordering prescription lensen to put in your vr set is also a thing and definitely worth it."
2023-03-31,"Thank you! I'm surprised by how many unique points your brought up compared to everyone else I've watched so far. Definitely need to see a full review of the final product, if it's still flimsy I will rather invest in a Lynx R1headset."
2023-03-31,3:00 What? Steam VR doesn't need a workaround to function on the quest headsets.
2023-03-31,"I'm pretty sure this is competing with the Quest pro, not the Quest 2"
2023-03-31,"Major kudos for not being scared and sticking to you guns, even with them right there! Now I get that it's Linus and no company would be stupid enough to tkae them on, but it still takes some cajones to call them out at there own booth right in front of them!  Dude didn't give them an inch, and didn't let them push him around or didn't fall for their marketing tricks. He was being honest and gave his unbiased opinion about everything in a calm and fair manner, and IMO now more than ever we desperately need more of that! 

I personally can't stand when tech youtubers completely change their tone and attitudes when they are in any kind of proximity to the big companies or at big show like this. Like any trace of objectivity or being impartialness goes right out the window (or even worse they just outright start being suck-ups), so they can stay in good standing with them and so keep getting review samples, not caring that it hurts their reputation and/or any trust they've built up with their viewers."
2023-03-31,"Not your best video, guys. There's a number of inaccurate claims and statements like, just to name two, 2 hours is not amazing battery life, that's just par for the course. The controllers are similar to the Quest 2, not the Quest Pro, they're a whole different beast. I also hear they won't be natively compatible with the Vive trackers pucks which is a huge letdown."
2023-03-31,"Err, the Quest, Quest 2 and Quest Pro all work with SteamVR out of the box too and thanks to sidequest you are not locked into The Oculus eco-system for standalone apps either."
2023-03-31,For that kinda price I would want the plastics to be carbon fiber
2023-03-31,Powerful new XR2? It's the same chip the Quest 2 launched with in 2020. Not sure I'd consider 2 hours great battery life. It's at the lower end of Quest 2 estimates.
2023-03-31,"I wish they did 2 cameras for better depth for the pass-through vision, but this looks solid. Though I’m curious to see what Apple brings to the table."
2023-03-31,The XR Elite's direct competitor is the Quest Pro. VIVE Focus 3 is HTC's answer to Quest 2.
2023-03-31,"""finger on the trigger, as we do here in the US"" 
What a legend"
2023-03-31,"If this doesn't support lighthouses that's a dealbreaker for me. I don't want inside-out tracking only, even if it's very good in front of your face."
2023-03-31,"""That's not 4k!"" - looks at HTC Staff 

Love it!"
2023-03-31,0:53 incredible battery is only 2 hours? So other standalone headsets which are the same or slightly better are also incredible
2023-03-31,"1100€
That's it, thanks for reading."
2023-03-31,"Metal can be both lighter and stronger than most plastics. They choice of materials here was made for COST, not weight. Making it with lightweight metals would have made the headset pretty expensive. Magnesium is extremely light and very strong, but also really expensive. For this sort of device, it would be the absolute best choice for weight and strength, but cost is always a factor, and that might double the final cost."
2023-03-31,as someone approaching over  -6 per eye I am glad  to see that dial for people with glasses but I hope that becomes a standard in the headsets and not just on bazillion dollar ones
2023-03-31,“competing” with the quest 2 but its like 2.5x the price…
2023-03-31,Hope valve comes with the second generation this year
2023-03-31,"The big stand-out is the build-in support for (simple) glasses - all they need now is visual adjustments in software to allow people like me with both prism and cylinder adjustments, to use a VR device! We're getting there!"
2023-03-31,I feel like you kept comparing it to the quest 2 but for the price and features I think it makes more sense to be a quest pro competitor. I'd like to know how it stacks up to that instead
2023-03-31,"Yeah that’s not consumer VR, that’s what we call “prosumer”. Waaaay out of the price range of your average person, especially nowadays."
2023-03-31,Love the positive review. I had a very good experience with my original of Vive which was replaced by the index but if you say with the tracking is a bit of a stretch so I don't use the index nearly as often as I would like. If I wasn't waiting for the psvr 2 I  would definitely consider this a buy very soon
2023-03-31,Maybe for half the price it would be pretty okay. Raising prices just to make a better headset than something they made years ago is pathetic.
2023-03-31,Did they… hire an actor/model for that ad? He’s too good looking for a random “man on the street”.  4:53
2023-03-31,"I was extremely hopeful about this headset because of all the features like dioptre ajdustement, extremely light weight, capable of wireless PC VR, pancake lenses. The resolution is decent - could be better but I could take it. 

However what killed it for me wasn't even the price. It was the FOV. It's comparable to Quest 2 FOV and I'm not gonna lie - while I did enjoy Quest 2 quite a lot I felt constrained a bit by FOV and after getting Index I couldn't go back to anything that would be significantly lower like that. E.g Pico 4 has only 5 degree less FOV - so that is an acceptable change for the clarity pico offers. However Quest 2 FOV with that resolution is absolutely not okay. Also with this resolution they could've at least push it to 120 Hz. I'm okay with 90 as long as the resolution warrants clarity and no SDE."
2023-03-31,"It's more expensive than the Valve Index but only offers a 90hz refresh rate and those speakers might get loud but I don't know if they (or the mic) will actually sound good.
Some very nice features with the perscription adjustment and some modularity, but I'm not in a hurry to get a new headset if it means I have to downgrade anything, especially something as important as the refresh rate. I personally also don't consider the tether wire or the base stations a downside so my 'important features' heirarchy is probably quite different to the people this headset is targeting."
2023-03-31,Anything that is standalone is AWESOME! Heck my brother got the family a Meta Quest 2 and I LOVE IT! So much to a point to where I will get my own headset next month when I get paid. :)
2023-03-31,"There's a few issues with this video:

1. The battery life is up to two hours -  the Quest 2 does more than that standalone and has a battery strap that adds an extra hour and a half or so. It has more than the pathetic Quest Pro, however.
2. The Valve Index is lower resolution than this, but runs at a higher framerate (144hz) meaning the total pixels pushed to your eyes per second is equal.
3. There's no ""hacky workaround"" for launching SteamVR on Quest hardware: it's an application in the otherwise pointless Oculus Home environment, or you can grab the far superior Virtual Desktop app.
4. The off-head sensor is not novel: both the Quest and Index have it.
5. The controllers are not new: they're the same from the Vive Focus 3.

Both this and the Quest Pro are late-to-market headsets, as the XR2 chip is two years old and will be deprecated later this year when the Quest 3 launches in Sept-Oct. This headset is a well-executed piece of tech but the market will not support it."
2023-03-31,"I see a lot of comments about it not being a decent competition to other, less pricy or more feature rich headsets. However, it's the first headset that has decent support for AR, and which is not made by Facebook (Meta might want to distance itself from their bad reputation by renaming, but they will always be Facebook in my eyes). 

For people like me who wouldn't buy any VR headset before decent Augmented Reality is implemented, and that don't use Facebook and don't want to make a Facebook account to use their device, it's the first headset I'm actually considering."
2023-03-31,"""competing Quest 2"" 
$400 vs $1100 
Ok, whatever you say."
2023-03-31,"Man, I was so hyped to sell my Quest 2 and buy this untill I heard that $1200. I really wish there were any decent competitors to Facebook in low-budget vr :("
2023-03-31,The quality of recruitment at LMG is off the charts
2023-03-31,"$1200 ?
I hate using anything related to Meta but Quest 2 wins EASILY.
with $1200 I at least would expect full hands tracking at least and maybe Eyes tracking.
with these two I can ""Kind of"" accept the price."
2023-03-31,Happy with my just bought Valve index. It wasn't available in Australia for so many years untill recently!
2023-03-31,You definitely don't need a 'hacky workaround' to play steam games on the quest 2
2024-08-02,"I haven't kept up with VR technology since I bought my own Vive, and I'm absolutely mindblown at the concept of standalone VR headsets. It might be worth it to get a new headset"
2023-03-31,"Having glasses and wanting VR, this is a perfect product for me"
2023-03-31,It's really annoying to have the comparison to the Quest 2. The Quest Pro is it's competitor without a doubt. 95% of people with a quest 2 would not get this. Come on guys this is fairly obvious given the 700 dollar price difference.
2023-03-31,1200 bucks?! Oof.
2023-03-31,"Just a fantastic review. Thank you. So many other videos just skim passed the specs, but your in depth look at build quality and features was fantastic! Thank you!"
2023-03-31,"Im exited to get a non facebook quest 2, even if it comes at a higher price"
2023-03-31,"an INCREDIBLE 2 WHOLE HOURS OF BATTERY!
wtf"
2023-03-31,1100??? How is that a competition?? Click baiting overdrive here. It's gonna flop at that price. Looks sick though.
2023-03-31,"Thank god they put the battery in the back like that, balancing the weight makes a huge difference. Looks like it would be very comfortable."
2023-03-31,"Really buried the lead with the price. More of a quest pro competitor, and the quest pro has more features."
2023-03-31,"""competing with the Q2"" at almost 3 time the price, yes... is competing with the Pro.... 
just few week ago when they talked about the Pro ""2 to 3 hrs battery life, is awful"", today ""this has 2 hr battery life, it's amazing"".... wow"
2023-03-31,"Competing with the Quest 2 at three times the cost. Real good idea there, HTC."
2023-03-31,"""I'm a huge classic music fan""
Doesn't know who Verdi is"
2023-03-31,This video is so full of mistakes.
2023-03-31,"Much like PSVR2, this is extremely underwhelming. The raw power isn't gapping the quest 2 in anything except for price. The refresh rate, FOV and resolution are roughly on par. Quest 2 natively supports wireless PC play, as well as their own bigger/better store, as well as the ""sidequest"" store. Now that we've seen PSVR2, steam is busy with the deck, and now we see HTC's new entry, it's become painfully clear I'll be waiting for ""meta's"" next flagship VR headset. I like to feel generational improvements, and clearly they're all competing with what the quest 2 achieved years ago (except much more expensive)"
2023-03-31,"Lol @ 3:08 I could feel the burn from even over here!

Looks good and all but rather pricey."
2023-03-31,"I will always watch all dBrand ads that any of you do. Such innovative advertising is what has made them a part of my memory, so even if I don't have anything to buy now, when I do, I will for sure remember them lol."
2023-03-31,I get that Short Circuit is supposed to be short and this was shot live at CES but the editing at the end was really jarring in this one.
2023-03-31,You can pick your phone up while wearing it and type a message. That right there just crushed the Quest Pro
2023-03-31,The funny thing is that their consumer VR tends to be the Pro 2 among enthusiast used with Index controllers. Consumers tend to use Quest 2. And Quest 2 users them selves are just buying the inside out controllers as an upgrade.
2023-03-31,5:00 I'm sorry these controllers look a lot more like the quest 2 controllers that are tracked by the headset than the quest pro ones and I don't see the cameras on them that would be necessary for camera based inside out tracking... Pretty sure they just do the usual tracked by the HMD's cameras using IR LEDs in the ring scheme.
2023-03-31,For this price i'd expect something higher than 110 FOV
2023-03-31,"A correction needs to me made, this isnt meant to rival the Quest 2, its meant to rival the Quest Pro, it (almost) has all the Quest Pro features, plus extra stuff. If it was meant to rival the Quest 2, it wouldnt be so expensive"
2023-03-31,dbrand trying to get Riley to do Billy on the Street but with Tech Tips is pure gold
2023-03-31,"That awkward cut from Riley back to ""anyway, change the topic"" was gold."
2023-03-31,I'd love to hear about the company privacy settings for these things.
2023-03-31,"The good thing about Quest 2 is that it cost only $400 with more powerful processor than Nintendo Switch, decent enough speakers, microphone, and storage (the lowest one). Also it is extremely reliable in stock setting"
2023-03-31,"I'm super interested in this headset, I like that you don't have to wear glasses with it, that part of the Oculus quest 2 always made me nervous about scratching the lenses (even with the spacers and frame attachment), I hope htc takes into consideration some of the critiques in this video to get it ready for prime time!"
2023-03-31,"I like the reverbs / valve index audio more^^

The dial so you don't need glasses is very cool though :D"
2023-03-31,"I liked the double jab at meta at the beginning. 

But this headset won’t make any significant impact on the market."
2023-03-31,"I just got my Pico 4, within 20 minutes of using it, my quest 2 was reset, boxed up and sold. amazing headset. however, learning that this one can adjust instead of having to wear glasses or get repscription lenses, Im interested."
2023-03-31,"It is a pet peeve of mine when people say a headset like this is a competitor to the quest 2 but then the price is well over 1000$. Like this is clearly an enthusiast headset, not a casual consumer headset, it's a 100% different class of product."
2023-03-31,This headset is perfect for arcade style setups / virtual laser tag with several players & similar. You can exchange the battery without shutting it down. It has a proper depth sensor and passthrough. It is extremely light if used without battery. I can see this getting very successful for businesses that sell VR experiences. Not sure if this will be a success for home consumers though at that price point.
2023-03-31,"Watching videos like these does anyone else feel like they're seeing the rapid evolution of a technology that you just kind of don't care about that much?  Obviously if you're into VR that doesn't apply to you, but as a gamer and a PC user watching these videos kind of feels like being a car guy and watching a video on new chair upholstery technology."
2023-03-31,LMAO the nervous glances at the HTC guys when calling out the 4K line
2023-03-31,"Quick correction - the XR Elite ($1100) is competing with the Quest Pro ($1500), not the Quest 2 ($400)."
2023-03-31,Built in prescription adjustment! I love that that's a things. Might just need to start saving
2023-03-31,"Given that the perceived resolution is dependent on the distance to the eye, the optics, and the screen resolution, wouldn't it be better to report/emphasize the angular resolution or pixels-per-degree (PPD)? The same screen resolution on two different head sets could lead to totally different experiences depending on these other factors. Beyond that, I think pixel response time is also extremely import for VR (as is refresh rate, but that at least is commonly reported in marketing materials)."
2023-03-31,The valve index does not have a higher resolution. A correction would be appreciated.
2023-03-31,"I love the perscription thing, as a glassess wearer with around -5 on both eyes and I can't wear lenses, so it's a really good soltion."
2023-03-31,"I bet they'll sell like, 5 of these. And those people will only be able to play the few tech demos. If I wanted a standalone headset, the Quest already exists."
2023-03-31,"I do hope they offer a PC-only version, as I don't really have a use for built-in VR. I'm having controller issues with my WMR, and MS abandoned us. I'm heavily considering just going Index, but a PC only version of this could make sense."
2023-03-31,at this price should have base station tracking
2023-03-31,"I'd like to see a return to tethered VR headsets with the newer lens tech, making something as small or smaller than this while being cheaper, lighter, and with a long, light, flexible cable."
2023-03-31,"Onestly the only stand alone headset that I found interesting on this CES, is the pimax crystal. 
Hope it will be a good headset."
2023-03-31,"I bet someone else already pointed out the Index is not higher resolution (1440x1600 vs 1920x1920).
It does have a native displayport signal though, so no compression artifacts."
2023-03-31,Valve Index has a higher resolution? That thing is totally outdated at 1440 x 1600.
2024-09-01,"Wow, the optics with the focus is awesome, im a glasses wearer so yeah love that"
2023-03-31,"You can get the Index with controllers and base stations for this price
The index alone costs less than that"
2023-03-31,"The horizontal resultion is 3840. 3.84K is close enough to 4K.

Calling it a ""lie"" is extremely unfair. It is close enough to standard 4K to get the extremely powerful marketing, when it's nearly the same."
2023-03-31,Why did he keep comparing it to the quest 2 when he should have been comparing  it to the quest pro? It really came off as a VR noob talking about VR.
2023-03-31,"""Don't lie HTC. I don't like it"""
2023-03-31,"In defense of the quest 2 I will say that it does not require a “hacky” fix to play steam VR.

You launch the oculus home program, connect the headset to the computer and launch the steam VR game you want to play."
2023-03-31,Please bring back the original Rift controller design with the ring on the bottom! I loved being able to drop the controllers onto my thumbs. The rings on the bottom also felt less cumbersome.
2023-03-31,"So you are talking about a 1 month turnaround for this product. I personally don't see how they would fix the head clips nor the gasket attachment within that amount of time since I can only assume they are finalizing and preparing for mass production. Otherwise, this product looks great, very promising."
2023-03-31,"The XR2 is not a new chip. It is already 3 years old.
Those controllers use outside in tracking unlike the quest pro's which use inside out tracking.
Quest headsets come out of the box with airlink which let's you use PCVR if you want to."
2023-03-31,"At $1200, this is a Quest Pro competitor. It costs 3 times as much as a Quest 2...."
2023-03-31,Can't believe it's so hard to for other companies to make good controllers. Look at the index ones... One simple strap is the difference between holding a stick and having an extension to your hands
2023-03-31,"I only want a headset for PC VR with inside-out tracking, fantastic ""displays"" and eye tracking; don't need the rest of the standalone bloat. Bonus points if it is able to do it wirelessly."
2023-03-31,Note that the diopter adjustment doesn't work if you have astigmatism
2023-03-31,"I know it’s expensive. But it’s feature set — the diopter adjustment alone, plus the pancake lenses, is amazing for me. The Quest 2 I have is good sure, but the lens inserts I have so I can see suck lol, the FOV sucks, the weight sucks for PCVR usage. This fixes basically all of that"
2023-03-31,closer to a quest pro competitor given that price and form factor
2023-03-31,"Omg, this looks perfect!

1) stand alone for portable experience - check!

2) can run my PC VR games when I am at home - check!

3) does not require META account and wont force Suckerberg into my life! - check!

Time to sell my old rift it looks like"
2023-03-31,"to use steam vr on a quest 2 you just have to use air link or a passthrough cable which are both native features on a quest 2. 3:00 what ""hacky workaround"" is he referring to?"
2023-03-31,"This should be a Quest 2-competitor based on its features, but the pricing puts it completely out of the competition. If it was 500-600 dollars, it'd make sense. OR if it featured EyeTracking, then the asked price would be okay-ish."
2023-03-31,Linus was right in saying the VR headset space right now feels like how 3D TV industry was a decade ago. Companies don't know whether a product will end up staying but at the same time don't want to miss out on it either.
2023-03-31,"I'm only interested in whether this finally has enough resolution and good enough passthrough that I can have an immersive multi-monitor mixed reality experience, where text is crisp and sharp in my editors."
2023-03-31,"You did them dirty and I like it. They deserve every critic about their headset, 1100 dollars is a crime."
2023-03-31,More of Riley's unsolicited Tech Tips! We will make him immune to rejection and the most confident person on the planet by the end of it xD
2023-03-31,"The price may be high but I never want to touch anything that has ""Meta"" attached to it so for me it's worth it to not have Zuckerberg spying on me (the guy really creeps me out) even if it's way more expensive. Granted I still can't afford it either way right now and I personally would rather have a PC connected VR headset then a lower powered standalone one but if the pass-through acts like a PC VR headset and not just passing a video stream to the headset like the Quest does then it might be a nice compromise. Inside-out tracking on the Vive Cosmos I have is...well it's not good so I hope they managed to improve it and a high quality pass-through camera sounds like a great addition. I guess I'll see what reviews say when it finally launches next month and try to save up enough for it if I like what I see and hear about it. Also while you did comment about the speakers it would be nice to know if everyone around you hears them or if they are focused in a way that mostly only you can because if they do just broadcast out in to the room then I hope there is a headphone jack on it so I can attach my own headset instead as I do not want others hearing what I'm playing if I don't want to. An optional USB-C port for attaching accessories to it would also be nice if it doesn't already have one which it looked like the only one I was able to see was the one the battery plugged in to."
2023-03-31,I'd rather keep my light houses for tracking and full body trackers. For the cost of a little upgrade to this headset I bought a full index set.
2023-03-31,happy to see HTC start the ditch the wand design more and more.
2023-03-31,I just can’t wait for when vr is actually approachable. Right now it’s way too expensive for what it is.
2023-03-31,More LTT videos with Adam please
2023-03-31,"Sorry, I'm blind, -11 here.  Quest 2 works fine with room for glasses with aftermarket padding w/o the glasses spacer.  

This unit looks all but identical even with the controllers.  Trying to copy a 2yr old design.  Nothing to write home about for double the price."
2023-03-31,"$1100 with a built-in battery pack, diopter, inside-out tracking AND no base stations? Yeah, that's actually really cheap. I played with both the original HoloLens and the HoloLens 2 at work. To say they were expensive is an understatement. I look forward to what 2025 will bring."
2023-03-31,Editor: We will not.
2023-03-31,"I do like the fact that instead of focusing on the positives the LMG employees aren't afraid to shit on companies at their own booths when they deserve it. I have to admit some of the features are pretty cool, like the diopter adjustment. However I exist in a group of users who's prescriptions will still warrant the use of separate lenses so I would assume this headset wouldn't be suitable for myself. 

There is no excuse for the front gasket magnets being weak, or the headset/battery disconnects being flimsy on a $1000 headset. A couple of decently strong rare earth magnets are what, a couple of dollars on Amazon? It's a shame to see what was once the pinnacle of VR headset manufacturing be reduced to releasing the equivalent of horse manure.

For anyone waiting to get into the VR space I would suggest waiting for what I'll refer to as the ""third iteration"" of VR headsets. 

Valve made a lot of good innovations with the increased refresh rate displays and the amount of thought they put into their controllers. 
Meta, as much as I hate the overarching company, has put a lot of thought into upping the specs of their displays and have excellent lenses. 
A couple of headsets have added eye tracking in this generation which allows for another level of control and allows for the quality of the displays to be rendered differently in your peripheral vision compared to where your eyes are focusing. 
And every manufacturer is putting thought into quality of life improvements such as the weight and comfort of their headsets and controllers. 

We just need one manufacturer to rise above and put all of the pieces together"
2023-03-31,"The fact that it goes to -6.00 prescription is massive for me, meta quest doesn't go that far. I don't wanna put in contacts to play games they're uncomfortable"
2023-03-31,Price needs to come down by a factor of like 3 before this is really a viable product. Anything more than 499 is a complete joke in the face of the VR industry. HTC is gonna get a pretty big reality check when their competitors beats the hell out of this price with their new entries into the market
2023-03-31,"not integrating the battery connector into the frame connector seems like a huge design oversight, would have looked soooo much cleaner without the non removable USB cable"
2023-03-31,"Why is it that everyone says quest 2 competitor when it is obviously a competitor for the Quest pro, irritates the hell out of me"
2023-03-31,I am very likely to buy this headset PURELY because it has the prescription Glasses adjustment! That is an absolute game changer for me.
2023-03-31,">long battery life
>2 hours

That thing's gonna definitely need battery packs"
2023-03-31,"The day a stand-alone, SteamVR compatible headset comes at around 400-600 bucks, I am selling my Index. Dancing around my room like a chicken to plug in my base stations and headset into power to enjoy a few hours of Beat Saber before undoing it all is a nightmare. I am working on automating that via HomeAssistant though. That said, I would love a stand-alone headset I could take with me on the go. One of my personal biggest applications, as a visually impaired person, is Virtual Desktop. I can sit as close to the screen as I want without throwing out my back. Having this on the go with my laptop would be HUGE XD Sitting in a train, plugging my laptop into the power and headset into the laptop and earbuds into my ears would allow me to spend a multi-hour ride infront of an actually big screen or set up a corner in a hotel to do actual work with proper posture and stuff - or even just run games on that virtual screen. It would help so much. But 1099 bucks is too much. But, the tech is getting there and I can wait a few more years. :3"
2023-03-31,"Love the subtle shots between D-brand and LMG. 

Like the “Overpriced stickers” and the “shortLinus” web link to d-brand"
2023-03-31,Seems like VR audio is still an afterthought in 2023... Which is too bad because having good noise cancelling and 3d audio would probably help boost presence.
2023-03-31,6:57 is that sky williams in the background?
2023-03-31,>1k for an LCD lowres low hz midtier smartphone CPU/GPU powered VR headset. Who exactly needs this? Looks like Varjo is still the only option for impressive PC VR setups with the rest of the market not really moving quality-wise for some years.
2023-03-31,I've always been confused about what kind of games people are playing on standalone VR headsets. The processing power difference is massive vs a tethered headset with a dedicated PC.
2023-03-31,Wait. How is loading oculus link and clicking on the steam game you want to play 'hacky'? It works. With the same amount of clicks you'd need to play with regular game in steam VR. And an amazing 2 hours of battery life? My quest 2 does at least 3 even after 2 years of heavy use. While I don't agree with Meta's practices they built a kickass piece of kit that I don't regret buying in the slightest.
2023-03-31,"The VR space is really hotting up, super exciting!"
2023-03-31,"""So you're a master?""

""I think so, yeah..."""
2023-03-31,Kinda just glossed over the difference between xr2 gen 1 and gen 2. It's more significant than you led people to believe. The gen2 is clocked quite a bit higher due to those changes on the soc.
2023-03-31,Need to see what the screendoor effect is like.
2023-03-31,"You are mistaken about the display resolution. The Valve Index runs at 1440x1600 per eye vs 1920x1920 on this device.

The HTC Vive Pro 2 has a higher resolution of 2448x2448."
2023-03-31,They should have made a version for PCVR gamers that stripped out all of the XR2 and battery stuff.  This would be a killer PCVR headset for around $500 to $600.
2023-03-31,Tragic that it only goes to -6 diopter. I know that covers like 99% of people but it sucks I'll probably never get to use vr.
2023-03-31,"It really needs a strap on the top of it. That way the weight of the headset is on the top of your head. Otherwise, it’s not going to be comfortable for longer playing sessions, just because the back is as heavy as the front."
2023-03-31,"Bro what ?  Save over $700 and just get a Quest 2, it literally does all the same things, just B&W passthrough and lower resolution.  In fact the Quest 2 now supports 120Hz via software update, so you're getting even better motion smoothness and frame rate.  I was seriously expecting a competitive price to Quest 2 after hearing all the features and specs, I'm baffled it's nearly triple the cost."
2023-03-31,"this is not a quest 2 competitor, its more of a quest pro competitor, considering the xr elites price"
2023-03-31,I wanted more about the pc solution because yes it's nice to having stand alone option but I also want the option to play simulators with high graphics.
2023-03-31,We need an entire video of you offering tech tips to random strangers lmao
2023-03-31,"I'm really struggling to pick a headset to replace the Rift. I like these controllers, external cameras, and dials for prescriptions, but it looks like when hooked to a PC, it wears like sunglasses. That concerns me that it could fling off. Hopefully they make an elastic band for tethered use"
2023-03-31,HTC XR Elite competes with more like quest pro and valve index instead of quest 2. This headset costs 1100$ while quest 2 is around 400$.
2023-03-31,Who doesn't want a free tech tip from Riley.
2023-03-31,"I pre-ordered it because everyone seems to be putting batteries in the back, making the headstrap fixed making it impossible to lay down in.  This coverts to a glasses mode so I can still lay back in bed and watch a movie.  Face/eye tracking is optional, not sure if I'll use but I can buy it later if I feel the need.  I'll pay a little extra for the insurance that fb or bytedance won't track me so although the price is steep I know it isn't substadised to steal my data.  Plus, and this is subjective, I think they look better than the sad panda look of the quest pro."
2023-03-31,At this point I'm just fast forwarding to the Dbrand ad
2023-03-31,"Its 2023, new VR headsets are coming and coming, and me here still more leans to Valve INDEX."
2023-03-31,I was really amazed at how great this looked until I found about the price... A quest 2 competitor for more than double the price? Wow
2023-03-31,Here I am still using my Vive and enjoying it.
2023-03-31,"I really wish some company just developed a pure PCVR headset with inside-out tracking (cuz I don't have the room for those dumb tracking stations in the room where I have my PC), a decent display and good weight-balancing. All headsets that look like they might be comfortable for me are all-in-one headsets, wich have a way too high price because they carry their own game-ready hardware inside. When I really just want to comforably use Steam VR."
2023-03-31,@5:05 looks like you going to a rave.  Got some glowsticking skills.
2023-03-31,This is my favorite headset so far. I just wish the resolution was higher.
2023-03-31,"What about the Vive Focus 3, we use them at work. More of quest alternative but only for enterprise state right now. Definitely my favourite headsets so far."
2023-03-31,I'd too see more of Riley's awkward social interactions in the wild
2023-03-31,Nice adjustable diopters. Unfortunately I'd still need to wear lenses because of astigmatism but they tried.
2023-03-31,"finally, ive been waiting for you guys to cover this one"
2023-03-31,"It's nice for people who are ok with compromises for all in one sets.... Im impatient and want the best refresh, and resolution screens and clarity. So at least 120hz, 240hz may not be that far behind.... 2k per eye, so we'd need 4k processing, but 4k per eye, so we'd need 8k GPU power... that might be the ultimate?"
2023-03-31,cool review but the valve index does not have a higher resolution
2023-03-31,Oh man we got that good live show chaos vibe going on today.
2023-03-31,"I WANT an affordable Headset that hooks up to a PC, $500 or under...let's go, my 73 year old mother really wants to try VR before she leaves this world and time is running out...I'm serious"
2023-03-31,"VR tech is getting pretty good. When will games get there? Until VR games drop the gimmicks, I don't see a reason to buy the hardware. My Oculus has been in storage for like 4 years because, aside from Alyx, there are no games I'd care to play."
2023-03-31,There is no need for a hacky way to play PCVR games with Quest 2 you just use Oculus Link and that's it.
2023-03-31,crazy crowd noise. easy hack is to use a smartphone for voice recording
2023-03-31,This would be extremely sick if it could plug straight in to a Nintendo Switch for travelling just to use as a display.
2023-03-31,There is some audio bug around 5:20
2023-03-31,we need a couple more years for VR to be good enough and affordable
2023-03-31,"Damn the inbuilt glasses is a game changer for me, it's the one thing that put me off all VR when the first Oculus Rift came out."
2023-03-31,"Sorry, but 'incredible' is not even close to the right word when describing a maximum of two hours of battery. Try 'somewhat adequate'. Anyway, for that price, I'm glad I ordered the PSVR2 which offers so much more for your money. I don't mind one light wire."
2023-03-31,"I have the original HTC Vive, and have loved it since I bought it. However, shortly after I got it, I had a base station fail and had to RMA it. It took OVER A YEAR for HTC to repair and return it. I believe their support has improved since then, but still. Even if it has, it should never have taken that long in the first place. I do need a higher res VR headset. But, I don't know if I'd want to buy another HTC product. However, rumor has it, that Valve is going to release an updated Index this year as well. So, I think I'll wait for that."
2024-03-30,I think I'm gonna hold out for the bigscreen beyond. This looks like a great headset but it doesn't offer what I want quite yet with stand alone headsets.
2023-03-31,adam doing the glowstick dance with controllers resulted in a hearty laugh
2023-03-31,3840 x 1920 is 4k but just with a more cropped aspect ratio. lots of 4k movies have black bars also
2023-03-31,But can I use it as a defacto wireless display to play heavy VR games with my PC?
2023-03-31,"After years of trying to undercut each other in a race to be the cheapest, every manufacturer is salivating at the thought that Apple will release a $2000-3000 dollar device and enable everyone else to start pushing prices up to at least $1500"
2023-03-31,"Honestly, the best thing about this showcase was le chef d'orchestre"
2023-03-31,if i had oculus games would there be a simple way to play them on it
2023-03-31,Like if this was $600 or $700 I could see the justification for the price but $1100 is ABSURD
2023-03-31,"Why did you keep comparing it to a Quest 2? Now the comments are full of confused people saying how ridiculous that is at $1100. It's a Quest Pro competitor. The controllers are inside-out tracked, the form factor is small with high-quality pancake optics, it has high-end passthrough and an XR depth sensor, none of which the Quest 2 has because it's in an entirely different tier. The only Quest 2 competitor is the Pico."
2023-03-31,I've been waiting way too long for a non-Quest standalone headset to play Beatsaber on. This is a bit pricey but it means I might finally have an option ^^
2023-03-31,"That stressed plug mechanism is very concerning. For a headset anywhere near this expensive, there should not be any such build quality issues threatening the lifespan of the headset, especially such an obvious structural one like that. There's no way they'll be able to address that before launch."
2023-03-31,We need Meta Quest Pro vs Vive XR Elite vs Pico 4.
2023-03-31,You're renting Quest 2 from Facebook/Meta. This one won't immediately get locked down if you do something Facebook/Meta doesn't like. That's where the $1000+ price comes in; because Meta is literally giving away the Quest 2 for cheap to get it as far out as possible
2023-03-31,"""use a hacky workaround to play your SteamVR games""

Uh, SteamVR has worked just fine on Oculus without anything ""hacky"" required for years now, AFAIK. Something new come up to cause this that I'm not aware of?"
2023-03-31,"Ever since quest 2 has come out, it has dominated the steam hardware survey. No other VR headset has come close, and they won't as long as they still charge obscene prices. The price that HTC is asking for is not great."
2023-03-31,10 points for not having a hair ruining top strap
2023-03-31,Holy hell it's way more expensive than its competitor.  There's just no way this thing will sell.
2023-03-31,Glad they are adding some classical music-related games on it. Hopefully they have some of my other favorites besides Mozart. Like Debussy. I  Debussy. Debussy is the best! Then finish off on the Bach's classics.
2023-03-31,The built in diopters sound legit!
2023-03-31,Wireless PC link is essential if it wants to compete.
2023-03-31,This bloke is very cool! Great addition to ltt!
2023-03-31,Is there a Pimax video coming?
2023-03-31,HTC's main disadvantage in the VR market is their pricing. at $1100 this is just too far out of reach for normal people who want to get into VR and dont have the room for base  stations or want to deal with Facebook.
2023-03-31,"I understand why HTC won’t make budget headsets since competing with a company actively engaged in cut to kill is pointless at best suicide at worst, but i still hope that when meta runs out of money for its little crusade HTC comes back into the pleb sector."
2023-03-31,"Not sure the Index has higher resolution. I have the original Vive, the Index and a Quest 2. The first two are in boxes."
2023-03-31,"Sucks to admit, but no Beat Saber in standalone = hard pass. 

Tough position though since Meta bought the studio out, so why would they ever put it on a new competing platform?"
2023-03-31,I'm just happy to see more VR stuff compete with the Oculus lineup.  I was afraid VR would die with the Metaverse.
2024-03-30,I’m not really worried about design as Ill customize it. The real question is does steam come loaded on the headset and do I require a PC to play?
2023-03-31,"If this was under like $700 i think itd be a major step in vr. But at $1100 it feels a lot more targeted at enterprise or people who are really serious about vr and don't already have a good headset as if you've already had a quest 2 or an index for awhile, it doesnt seem like itd be worth the upgrade for the average user."
2023-03-31,"Jeez that price though, but I get it, seems like HTC isn't biting much of the production cost, which is fair, not everyone can afford to lose 700 billion in company value trying to bring this stuff to everyone, you really do have to give Meta some credit for that, looks like a pretty good headset though, not the biggest fan of it not having some kind of center/over the head strap, it really does help to balance things out more, plus unless halo/glasses strap kind of setups are pretty tight around your face, they have a tendency to slip downwards, top straps just help to keep things in the right place, ya know? but I'm sure aftermarket stuff will come out for it once it's out, there's tons for the Quest 2 now."
2023-03-31,"3840 is also not 4K since 4K = 4,000. I don't like that companies call it 4k. Rather you'd call it 2k for the 2160 aspect of it.
5:14 why doesn't it say ""GRIP ZONE"" on it, right Springfield? OH is that where we're supposed to wrap our hand around to use your xd mod 2? THANKS SPRINGFIELD. Super helpful."
2023-03-31,I love that I won't need my glasses. I wish they had done something to help keep the lenses from fogging though. Thos are the two main reasons I don't use either of my headsets much
2023-03-31,whats up with the glass on the front when behind the glass is completely covered besides the tiny camera. Could have only put glass over the cameras and saved a few grams of weight which is definitely relevant in a vr headset
2023-03-31,4:52 NPCs aren’t great for sponsor spots.
2023-03-31,You should pipe the audio through nvidia broadcast and see if it can clean up the background conversations
2023-03-31,"Impressive battery life... 2hrs? no, 6 is Impressive."
2023-03-31,"The Index does NOT have a higher resolution that this, it’s actually pretty low by 2023 standards. Index is only 1440 by 1600 per eye. 

Also I’d say this is clearly competitive by more with the $1500 Quest Pro. It does t have everything that does, but it does have some things it doesn’t, including the depth sensor, diopter adjust and modular design."
2023-03-31,"My only question is, how well does the diopter work for astigmatism? Cause for that the rotational angle of the lens matters. My guess is that it probably doesn't."
2023-03-31,That head set with out the stand alone hardware to drop price for use with a station!!
2023-03-31,that dude did NOT want tech tips
2023-03-31,I've been a Quest 2 owner for a long time and I've owned it throughout three different homes so base stations is something that I actively avoid. The specs look great as does the size of the device. I'd definitely pick it up....for $599...MAYBE $699. But $1099??? Are you out of your mind?!
2023-03-31,in germany this is more expensive then the valve index (1079€). preoder is 1399€... beside the new xr2 the specs are more like between the quest 2 and pico 4. and to be fair you are going to use it mostly for pcvr :D
2023-03-31,I really like the ability to use the VR headset as lenses like RX glasses. I just also need it at like. -13
2023-03-31,"Im saying this again and again, I whish you guys had a vr channel too.
(I know there are other VR youtubers, but having more perspectives on it is great)"
2023-03-31,"tbh ""not reliant on external pc"" will always be the opposite of a selling point to me.."
2023-03-31,"Been waiting for an HMD with built-in diopters. It finally arrives, but the lenses are not powerful enough for me."
2023-03-31,So is the valve index² ever going to come out?
2023-03-31,"Not a quest competitor, too pricey"
2023-03-31,"I don't thing I'll get this one, a bit pricey, but the prescription lenses adjustment thing is a game changer!"
2023-03-31,I think vr headsets should have honeycomb cutouts for weight reduction like gaming mice imo
2023-03-31,How good is the colors?  I'm looking to see if I could replace a small art monitor with a headset.
2023-03-31,It's not a quest 2 direct competitor like you keep suggesting. It's way more in line with the quest pro in terms of price and features. Not sure why you never mentioned the quest pro at all and kept comparing it to the quest 2.
2023-03-31,Oh nice a Quest 2 competitor at ...1099$ after the Q2 has been out for two years. HTC reminds us again why they left the consumer market time and time again
2023-03-31,"It really needs to be priced differently, they should make a similar headset but cheaper. Maybe take the vive flow and make it into a proper quest competitor. Flow 2 maybe?"
2023-03-31,"Man I was interested in this until that price drop, who is this marketed towards? At that price point you have to already be a pretty big VR enthusiast, and at that price point you're vastly better off getting the Index. This definitely inst competition for the Quest 2, but I guess I can see it being competitive towards the Quest Pro."
2023-03-31,"I mean, you can wear glasses in VR, you should actually. The Quest 2 comes with a spacer for this reason. Or you know, contacts."
2023-03-31,I don't know... I still can't get used to Adam hosting and being in front of the camera. He looks like an Amish Linus.
2023-03-31,This headset really isn’t groundbreaking. And compared to some of the new headsets it CES this year. It’s not the best for the estimated buck.
2023-03-31,"I love how real he is here. He's passionate, but objective."
2023-03-31,It's not gonna compete with Quest 2 when Vive XR Elite starts at 1099 and Quest 2 Starts at 399
2024-06-03,Not Riley harassing some random person
2023-03-31,"Ooh so close, I am still getting an Index, I love that inside out tracking but the rest of the stats..."
2023-03-31,"I wanna see the Pico headset on the channel, you guys should be able to get it from China contacts. It's supposedly ByteDance's answer to the VR market and a lot of my mainland Chinese colleagues seem to like it"
2023-03-31,"I'll be waiting to see if this has a good mic and support for the games I use in standalone mode.  VRChat, RecRoom, Contractors, Real VR Fishing, and Population: One."
2023-03-31,"It's not entirely accurate to say this is a SteamVR headset. It can stream PC VR games over wifi or USB, but it has no native PC connection (DisplayPort or HDMI). Its not a native SteamVR headset. There will be more lag and compression artifacts when playing PC VR games."
2023-03-31,"Will these also function as just a regular headmounted display, like Rokid or Nreal AR glasses?"
2023-03-31,"It's very interesting to see such a light headset but the price !? What the hell are they smoking out there ? There is no way anyone in their right mind would choose this over a Quest 2/Pico 4. It's basically a lighter version of the Quest 2 for 3 times the price ! It's not even an upgrade, you have about the same resolution and FOV, same processor capability, about the same battery life and you lose the ecosystem and exclusives from Facebook. I get that the Quest 2 is sold at cost and not every company can do that, but this product is DOA because its main competitor has been in the space for years and is way, way cheaper.

I have a Q2 myself and it's an amazing piece of tech, it's confortable with the right straps, the resolution is decent enough for a variety of games, the 120Hz option is amazing when you can use it, tracking is absolutely on point... What are the arguments of HTC to make me pay 3 times what I paid for the Q2 to get the same headset but lighter?"
2023-03-31,"""i controlled an orchestra"""
2023-03-31,Remember when HTC made top end android phones and then just vanished? Like the HTC One was an awesome phone....
2023-03-31,"went through the whole video thinking ""yeah, maybe that will be my next headset"" and then i saw the price at the end"
2023-03-31,XR2 is hardly new. Claiming XR2+ is basically the same is a little disengenious. Coming to market in 2023 with XR2 is a no go when Quest 3 will come out this year for 500ish and XR3.
2023-03-31,"Screen door effect? Readability? Ability to use on PC without the need for Steam or other VR apps or hacks, aka web browsing VR videos? You know, the things that matter... what about those very known issues? I'd be willing to pay for their steep price if these things are all resolved in the new headset. Otherwise, I'll continue waiting patiently."
2023-03-31,"Sounds great but the price is a little too steep, I'd really like to have some kind of hybrid between this one and the Index without base stations for about a grand."
2023-03-31,HTC really needs a win so I'm glad this could be something at least!
2023-03-31,"they actually got a freaking domain just for Linus, how lovely"
2023-03-31,Quest 2 competitor? NAH! Get a quest 2 with a pair of contact lenses and you basically have the same thing minus a couple hundred bucks
2023-03-31,"""Finger on the trigger like we like to say in US hehehe"" ffs i rolled out of my chair lol"
2023-03-31,I am not cheap and I am not willing to give Meta one cent of my money.  This will do nicely.
2023-03-31,"as someone once said (i dont remember who): the future is here, just not for every one"
2023-03-31,5:04 those moves men!
2023-03-31,If you can afford this headset you can probably afford contacts
2023-03-31,"no one talking about the awkward convo from Riley? dude, just say yes and let Riley get his 10 seconds talking time"
2023-03-31,"Any reason you keep mentioning other headsets but not the Pico 4 which is about 3 times cheaper, has slightly higher resolution and panake lenses?  A few of us here have been using one with a decent graphics card, Virtual desktop and Steam VR games which look amazing."
2023-03-31,"At the end of the video I'm not seeing how this is the one to beat... Don't you clickbsit us now, SC!"
2023-03-31,"That finger on the trigger joke, my god"
2023-03-31,"It's more so competing with the Quest Pro, not the Quest 2. The Quest 2 is like a 3rd of the price and does not have the passthrough features. The Quest Pro has the newer lenses/thinner form and passthrough features and is priced at $1500"
2023-03-31,"Get it to $400 and I'll buy one. I'll never buy a Facebook product and I don't want to connect to a computer, but I'm excited to try some day, if I don't get completely burnt out on gaming and burn all my systems first."
2023-03-31,"They're betting there is a large enough market willing to drop cash to avoid Meta, and I think they're right as long as the thing gets games on it."
2023-03-31,"1920 height actually is a valid 4k resolution...
but 2x 2k width per eye does not make anything 3840 wide, its not 4k, just not for the reason you quoted."
2023-03-31,"Was going really well until the price was dropped. Come on HTC, to bring VR to the masses we need affordable headsets. Also as a PC VR user only it would be really sweet to get a dedicated PC VR headset that either connects straight to the GPU or uses 5GHz wifi but without all the standalone tech, I miss the days of the Rift. I would happily pay the cost of a Quest 2 for a standalone unit."
2023-03-31,I was so excited for an actual reasonable consumer headset and then I got to hear the price at the very end...
2023-03-31,"The nice thing with new tech like VR is that it get cheaper with time, oh wait.."
2023-03-31,"""4K equals to 3840x1920"".... This guy edits for sure."
2023-03-31,This is a vr headset I would actually buy
2023-03-31,"The Pico 4 is still the best price/performance for wireless PCVR and the Quest 2 is still the best price/performance for standalone VR. Also brand new XR2 chip? The Quest 2 is more than 2 years old at this point. Something like the Pico 4 using it is fine, since it's actually pretty cheap and it's clocked much higher compared to the Quest 2. But $1100-$1500 headsets like this and the new Quest Pro using it? That's just downright unacceptable. It's pretty much a Pico 4 with a removable battery and better finger tracking. But a worse resolution and worse standalone game catalogue. Not worth nearly 3x its price (though honestly Pico 4's best usage is for wireless PC VR)."
2023-03-31,"I remember when I bought Vive because it was the best for wearing with glasses. Now they release that, too bad I did LASIK..."
2023-03-31,What work around are you talking about? oculus works perfect with steam. And oculus wireless play is fire.  Just think that should be cleared up.
2023-03-31,2 hours battery life is actually rather lame. The oculus go got 2 plus hours 5 years ago.
2023-03-31,"You need a correction. Facebook does not make the headset, its Meta. The company is Meta, facebook is not a legal entity anymore. It is the Meta Quest 2"
2023-03-31,HTC vive was the most spammed and had the largest advertising campaign. the reality was most people owned oculus CV1
2023-03-31,I want a VR system where all I have to do is hold two controllers and close my eyes.
2023-03-31,Thank you for giving an actual review
2024-03-30,Can’t we just take off the battery and run the Xr elite through a wire? It looks like a headset that it could be possible with. I might be wrong but if not why don’t we just do that and never use the battery?
2023-03-31,"What is he talking about? My quest 2 works with steam vr right out of the box so to speak. I didn't need a ""work around"". And the wireless streaming works great. Quest 2 is still the best headset for the price, even after the bullshit price increase."
2023-03-31,"big improvement in the VR scene, still probably going to wait just for it to get a little less weight and innovated more before I get one though. I also really dislike the ecosystem scheme"
2023-03-31,"Given the price, this is a non-starter. The Quest Pro is only a little more money for a better headset. HTC needs to cut the price for this in half and then we're talking."
2023-03-31,"So… did Luke and Linus both donate a strand of hair to the cloning machine or like, do the fusion dance???"
2023-03-31,"I'm getting the feeling that as HTC continues, they are pricing their products way out of their target audience due to misleading advertising and some of design and use choices"
2023-03-31,"Thanks for mentioning the 2K resolution, on behalf of the many normies I know it IS appreciated !!! (PS, its not so much not being 2160p that bugs me, as it is it not being anywhere close to the 3840p part, as well as them trying to confuse the issue by acting as if having 2X 2K screens is the same as 4K. It's also on screens sitting 4"" from your eyeballs which makes the difference in pixel density of these resolutions much more apparent than on your tv for example. So thanks again for making it clear for all the normies I know <3  ) Though I suppose while one could try make the argument if taken together they are 4K, since each eye is receiving a 1920p image, but the pixel pattern is ""meshed"" as each eye sees essentially the same image field, rather than being  ""end to end"" effectively making a 4K image as if each eye was seeing one half of the display, unless I'm missing something, in which pls correct me as I'd like to know. I guess it comes down to resolution being a matter of pixel density, which has been the traditional definition, or a measure of total pixel width of the 2 displays added together, which I think is misleading."
2023-03-31,"Price point keeps on being an issue for every VR product, they arent going to take the market by storm like the quest did untill that is addressed."
2023-03-31,This feels like another ad
2024-03-30,Sent one back after about 10 hours of use. This thing is a $5-$600 VR rig at best.
2023-03-31,Best sponsor spot ever
2023-03-31,"quest 2 comparison is unfair. Quest 2 without facebook lock is 800 or 900 dollars, cannot remember anymore. It is the business edition. HTC does not sell your personal data to all companies."
2023-03-31,"I absolutely hate these all in 1 headsets. Creates locked down nonsene, abandonware and E-waste.
People buy these and end up just using them connected to their PC anyway so now you have $£€200+ of hardware increasing the weight, size and cost of the things doing nothing to improve the experience.

Where are the £$€200 Desktop only VR headsets?"
2023-03-31,"I was like: Yeah! That's nice, seems very cool.
Then I heard 1100 $... Nope, I'm out, for that money I'd rather not use VR and buy decent PC upgrade!"
2023-03-31,As soon as you said $1100 I switched to epic fail videos. Good Lord
2023-03-31,Can you adjust these lenses if you are longsighted??
2023-03-31,i love how every time he talks about a criticism he looks off camera
2023-03-31,"Not the best preview, a lot of weird choices for descriptions and unfortunately inaccurate information. ""Passthrough to PC?"" Did you mean to say it could be used as a native SteamVR headset? (I already know it does but an inexperienced consumer wouldn't understand that statement.) The Valve Index has a lower resolution but a higher refresh rate at 144HZ.  Call it a Quest Pro competitor. The RGB camera AND the depth sensor in front aren't just to make camera passthrough nice to text on your phone it's there for AR (Augmented reality) apps. The battery can be removed when you just want to use it connected to a PC which would make it super light native VR headset (I assume it's native SteamVR) which is also better for performance because it won't require another app (the Meta desktop app) running on top of SteamVR."
2023-03-31,"i donnu i run a pimax and by now id say its better then a index in almost anyway in my use case.
waiting for the 12qled myself to see how good it is and if it as good as they say ill get it for sure"
2023-03-31,"Hahaha Riley, this was the best street tech tip yet"
2023-03-31,Why are you comparing this to the quest 2?
2023-03-31,"With no cameras on the back of the headset, inside out tracking is still unfortunately a no-go for me. Drawing arrows and sheathing swords are common enough actions that I've seen struggling on other videos."
2023-03-31,"« Lens adapt to your prescription » 
It goes only to -6 
Aside from the questionable marketing of HTC, the price is ridiculous. No eye tracking? No face tracking? Only 90hz? 
It’s like all headsets today are the same as the one 3 years ago. This is sad."
2024-06-03,“We’ll put B roll there” (they did not)
2023-03-31,"This is getting out of hand, now there's two of them!"
2023-03-31,"It's expensive, but still less expensive than selling my soul to The Zuck."
2023-03-31,I'll just wait for Valve's standalone headset.
2023-03-31,"""There is gonna be passthrough to your PC""

I love it when reviewers advertise features that the manufacturer themselves do not advertise. (Do you see a display port connector anywhere on this device???) This headset uses the same high-latency compression-based methods of linking to your PC that the Quest uses. And it is no less ""hacky."" (Though Oculus's own software implementation can be charitably called dogshit. It is worth acknowledging that this HTC headset will also have Virtual Desktop just as the Quest does... so this headset will be using the same software most Quest users use anyway.)

It is fairly easy to tell LMG has a huge blindspot wrt and underestimation of the Quest when talking about VR.

The video presents the Quest 2 as the competitor to this headset when it is more blatantly a competitor to the Q2 Pro. (In what universe does a $1100 device compete with a $400 one)"
2023-03-31,"Love the diopter, love the battery at the back! HTC really doing good work, hopefully they get some market share before apple shows up!"
2023-03-31,"I legit want one without the standalone part, I want good inside out wiithout anything to do with facebook. I mean, I can't afford a headset at all, but if I could I wouldn't get one with base stations (and current inside out ones are old and not that good afaik)."
2023-03-31,This is a Quest Pro competitor. Quest 2 is pretty old by now and not even close in price.
2023-03-31,"This has a lot of nice features, but I was thinking the price would be around $800.  $1,099 just seems a little high, though if the early reviews of it are good, maybe I'll hold off on getting a Quest 2"
2023-03-31,"Would asume the competator would be the quest pro, not the quest 2?"
2023-03-31,"that price is a HUGE yikes. If I'm getting another headset, I'd much rather just get a MQ2 or another index (mine is falling apart)"
2023-03-31,"Once it goes over 800, it’s competing with the quest pro"
2023-03-31,0:18 Why not just redo it if you mess up the line?
2023-03-31,"Yeah, I've been looking at upgrading my Q2 for literally years, I think I'll be having one of these."
2023-03-31,"Ugh. Lost me at the price. Cut it in half and I’ll consider it. VR is fun, but I probably wouldn’t have gotten into it if I didn’t get my Quest 2 for free"
2024-03-30,Pretty sure the Valve Index has a lower resolution. It's more than 3years old!
2023-03-31,Index resolution...if only I could see it past the endless glare!
2023-03-31,"im new to VR headsets, so do we need to use our glasses or remove it to wear these things?"
2023-03-31,"So what apps exactly is this going to run? Who's going to write them? Where are they going to be sold? This will die out as an ""SDK"" and never be heard of again, like so many Vive things."
2023-03-31,treating 2 hrs like a lot of time in a vr headset feels so weird to me
2023-03-31,What an absolutely horrible marketing decision with the classical get up guy...... Dang
2023-03-31,"hmm, nope. Its target isn't the Q2, it will be Q pro. Q2 isn't an XR headset. It will be awesome if you could make an episode to compare the Vive XR Elite and Quest Pro and other XR HMDs."
2023-03-31,now we just need HTC to get back into making phones as well
2023-03-31,Is this not competing with the Meta Quest Pro that is $1499? Why compare it to the cheaper older unit alone?
2023-03-31,"LMG covering VR devices tends to tickle me the wrong way, they don't seem to have a thorough understanding of how the VR ecosystem works"
2023-03-31,I was almost sold tell the price reveal.
2023-03-31,"""The one to beat"". ""$1100"". Nope."
2023-03-31,"Isn't Vive XR Elite competing more with PSVR 2? considering the price they're pretty close.
PS5 + PSVR 2 is $1050 and Vive XR is $1100"
2023-03-31,I want more from the random guy on the street tbh
2023-03-31,"when you have -8 on both eyes and it only goes to -6...  feelsbadman :(

(btw my not-qualified guess is that it is the + range and not -. Minus is shortsighted, so everything within 10cm is fine, everything beyond not. The opposite applies to far-sighted (+) people"
2024-03-30,I want to know the cost of the headset. Can you play standalone games? Would be pretty neat.
2023-03-31,I feel like this review didn’t really sell this as the headset to beat.
2023-03-31,would like one without the battery for cheaper.  I only use it with my pc.
2023-03-31,Finally HTC has good controllers!
2023-03-31,"Not a Quest2 competitor at over double the price. Not a fan of the ""Quest Competitor"" ""Quest Killer"" clickbait. Quest2 competition would be great but this aint it"
2023-03-31,If I had the space for a full setup I'd DIY a VR backpack system and jump into some FPS old school magic and sowrd play style games in a heartbeat
2023-03-31,"Are they claiming to be competing with Quest 2? That thing is about half the price even after the greedy price hike, and Meta is supposed to release the Quest 3 this year."
2023-03-31,"this videos script needed a lot more proof reading...
you're constantly switching around quest 2 and quest pro.
you're getting facts wrong about eco the systems and software support.
you're comparing VR and XR devices like they have the same audience and goals.
Do better!"
2023-03-31,I was really interested in buying this until i saw the price tag
2023-03-31,I Love the videos sponsored by d-brand the sponsored segments always are chaotic
2023-03-31,the weight is a game-changer
2023-03-31,"Assuming I had the cash, that seems super duper neato. I onlt got into VR once I could get something other than an Oculus (f Facebook) on the used market, managed to snag a Dell Visor off ebay. While probably not perfect, I've been very happy with that overall, but I only spent like.. £100-120 all in with that."
2023-03-31,Anything that is not Oculus gets a + from me
2023-03-31,"I was so into this until the price; as a quest 1 user who's sick of facebooks' crap I was ok with something with last gen specs in return for a better ecosystem, but 1.2k for a last gen headset releasing 2 years too late?
I'll wait for deckard."
2023-03-31,"Hope we can switch the diopter, my left eye is at -7 and the graduation here only goes from 1 to 6 :/"
2023-03-31,"Good review, but those are NOTHING like the Quest Pro controllers like he said. Quest pro controllers have their own processors and cameras to do their own inside out tracking. Those are like the Quest 2's controllers."
2023-03-31,"Another gadget you buy, use for 2 hours and then watch gather dust on your shelf."
2024-03-30,Let me know when we get 120hz + oled lenses and ill go back to vr stuff.
2023-03-31,"I was like ""nice, might actually give this a go after having played around with a friend's Meta Quest 2 for a year"". And then the price dropped ahahha wtf are they thinking?"
2023-03-31,I had a heart attack at that price.
2023-03-31,What hacky-workaround for the Quest 2? Air Link is like a menu press away and you can just jump straight into Steam VR :/
2023-03-31,I'm pretty impressed with the price when going up against the meta quest pro.. Its not the typical over pricing we normally see from HTC. I really hope to see HTC do well again in the VR space.. I miss them and the products they used to make.
2023-03-31,Are all these vr technical terms new words or were they always around
2023-03-31,perfect headset to compete if it wasnt almost triple the price of the quest 2
2023-03-31,The price had to be competitive
2023-03-31,"12000 USD? Consumer product? Ah yes, “consumer product”"
2023-03-31,"I have one Quest 2, I tested a PICO G2, and now I see this HTC Vive, but I'm not impressed : because it's been three years and standalone VR headsets haven't evolved much. 4K resolution is not a big deal (2000 pixels per eye). I guess in a few years we will see real 6K resolution headsets (I'm talking about standalone ones, not the wired ones). I despise the screendoor effect, and while the HTC Vive appears to have slightly higher resolution than the Oculus Quest 2, I will wait a few years before purchasing a new headset. I will wait for the real 6K."
2023-03-31,"Which hacky workaround to play SteamVR games?! That's nonsense. All Oculus headsets can play any VR game in Steam.

Oculus headsets always use and have used SteamVR with a press of SteamVR play button in Steam - if you so wish. Any OpenXR game, however, is better without SteamVR (because it's buggy and really meh compared to Dash) 

It's the OTHER way around. If you want to play Oculus exclusives with another headset (Vive/Index/etc), then you would need to use ReVive and launch through SteamVR.

Does ANYONE in LTT even use VR? WTF"
2023-03-31,Seems like a winner if it was half the price.
2023-03-31,"So, does it run steam VR natively on the headset (without a pc), or would I have to re-buy everything on the vive ecosystem? If the latter, I'm for sure not interested."
2023-03-31,"Err… I mean you can get custom lenses for the Quest for less than that…. So yeah… It looks amazing, but that price tag is a bit much."
2023-03-31,going to call this out every single launch it seems... I don't know how long it takes for these companies to FINALLY make a decent vr headset... last decent ones were gen1 headsets... and that I mean one that can finally get back to the basic functionality of being able to display the color black... make a f**g headset with an oled panel already
2023-03-31,"lost interest as soon as I heard the price

I got a quest 2 with a bunch of pricey extras second hand for about $300 equivalent, and it plays just fine with Steam VR unlike what this video would lead you to believe"
2023-03-31,Dam I was so close to ordering this. But no 256gb ?!!! Are they releasing save power bank for long sessions?  And no iPhone app support.. Holding my money until hTc clears it.
2023-03-31,"I would like to know, when it comes out if I can use the controllers with my HP Reverb G2 through Steam? Not as good as the Index controllers, but will be much better than the controllers the G2 comes with."
2023-03-31,Is it Wifi 6E or 6?   ie.. 160hz support?   Does it work with Virtualdesktop or their own solution?   Is it good blacks like Quest 1?
2023-03-31,"""Finger on the trigger,  as we say here in the US."" OOF."
2023-03-31,Sonds like a sponsored commercial
2023-03-31,This is cute but Somnium VR1 is the boogeyman of all PCVR this year.
2023-03-31,"3840 X 1080 has a different name - it's called FHD ultrawide. Sorry but that just killed the vive for me lol glhf HTC. Who they think they are selling to?

...and it costs bloody $1200
I guess that cost difference to quest 2 is how much we are worth to Meta"
2023-03-31,"Honestly 2160p is just as not 4k as this. Actually 4k would be, well 4096x2160 which is not what ""4k"" monitored have. So it is just as much 4k as those. Just a different aspect ratio."
2023-03-31,"DoA for me. The cost is way too high.

If they want to compete with the Oculus quest 2. They have to meet its price range. Otherwise, they aren't even competing products."
2023-03-31,that demo looked kinda funny
2023-03-31,This video failed to mention of lot of details about the headset that are fairly important to the overall experience. Hopefully you guys get one in the studio and do a proper in-depth review.
2023-03-31,The Vive is STILL collecting dust on my Ikea Kallax.
2024-09-01,"The quality of this video isn’t good. Some things that were said are just wrong, it was never a Quest 2 (300$-ish) competitor, it was a Quest Pro (1500$ at release) competitor. The controllers are NOT similar to Quest Pro controllers, they are very similar to Quest 2 controllers. Some lines were messed up and just weren’t fixed (how do you forget the product name?). I know it’s an old video but I’m surprised this passed the QA check"
2023-03-31,They should have just wait a year for next xr gen 3 soc. AV1 support and WiFi 7 is too big streaming improvement to buy this in 2023.
2023-03-31,Comparing it to the quest 2 when the quest pro is out is ridiculous
2023-03-31,Only question. Can it be used with Index Controllers
2023-03-31,Is it bettter than the index?
2023-03-31,"Those controllers are nothing like the Quest Pro controllers. Those are from the Vive Focus 3, and are more like the Quest 2 controllers. For the $1,100 price, the controllers are a low point for such a pricey headset."
2023-03-31,"It's marginally better than the Quest 2 for a much higher price. I want to upgrade my Quest 2, but this isn't it."
2023-03-31,I liked it until you mentioned the price lmao that's way too expensive
2023-03-31,"Sorry, but I can't shell out $1100 for this thing. Has to be the most premium vr set ever, but it's just smaller."
2023-03-31,"I really, really wish someone would make a good wireless VR headset without all the standalone crap I will never need, and price it in range of the Quest 2.

There is no way in heck I will ever buy something from Facebook, but right now I feel like all the good options are either Facebook, or > $1000. That was already a hard sell when the Valve Index originally came out, but I really cannot justify spending that much money on a three year old headset."
2023-03-31,I just want htc the release a new wireless adapter for the pro 2. Come on htc!
2023-03-31,Especially after the quest price issues
2023-03-31,"""finger the guitar"" sign* opens comments"
2023-03-31,"Good review. I really want to try VR ..but it looks like I'm going have to wait and hope for it to become more affordable .. someday. A man can dream, right?"
2023-03-31,"I wonder how relevant this headset having a standalone feature is?  Especially outside of the Meta ecosystem. As far as I'm aware the most popular VR headset right now is the Quest 2 by far. Some of the Quest 2 users like me are exclusively PCVR, and have little to no interest in a standalone feature, and then the rest probably won't want to switch to an ecosystem with a smaller library, all while having to repurchase titles. It just seems like the feature is a ton of unecessary added cost, so hopefully they have another model they're releasing without it."
2023-03-31,I might be interested if it had 120hz.
2023-03-31,"Quest 2 competitor? Yeah nah, Quest Pro competitor, yup definitely I'd say. I just cannot agree with any comparison to the Quest 2 as it's almost three times as expensive. It's a competitor the the Quest Pro considering the standalone nature and features and I guess even the Valve Index and other similarily priced Steam VR headsets, since there's PCVR compatibility. But with that outta the way, good coverage of the devices features :) (TL;DR Eeeeeeh, some questionable comparisons but good video over all :D)"
2023-03-31,If it was half the price it would be an insane quest competitor. But at this price is just isn't even related.
2023-03-31,"Oh man. With a few tweaks, this could be the one."
2023-03-31,The only way that tech tips dude would have been better is if you had to blur his face because he would't sign a release.
2023-03-31,Does it have display via type c or displayport for pcvr? Couldnt find any info on that
2023-03-31,what should I get if I want no base stations and the highest res possible?
2023-03-31,Need VR headset to compete with the Quest 2
