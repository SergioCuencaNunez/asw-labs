2023-03-28,I really love watching about stuff I cannot afford.
2023-03-28,"One thing I've noticed is the directionality of the transparency mode seems much improved. I go on a lot of walks with my camera and take pictures of birds, and often have my Airpods in listening to music, but use transparency mode to listen for birds. On the previous generation, it was often difficult to pinpoint exactly where a bird was. It was more a general direction, like to the left or right of me, but pinpointing a specific direction or height was difficult. First walk with the new ones and I was hearing the birds so clearly and coming from such a specific direction that I couldn't initially tell if it was coming from the song I was listening to or not. I heard a bird from directly above me and looked up just in time to see a bird flying directly overhead, exactly where I heard the sound come from. I could easily hear the footsteps of people coming up from behind me on the walking path too. Really excited to go for my first run with them tonight and hopefully get some experience with the adaptive part of the transparency mode."
2023-03-28,Whoever edited the explanation on how adaptive transparency works did a beautiful job!
2024-07-30,Just came here to justify my purchase.
2023-03-28,I'm a fire alarm technician and we usually do alarm verifications and work near really loud equipment on a day to day basis. I tried the adaptive transparency mode today because we were working near a loud water pump and holy that thing really works well! I can see myself using this feature a lot for my work specially as I work around other team mates and want to be able to hear them but still cut out the loud horn or bell noise whenever we have to ring them which are sometimes over 85 decibels and can be painful to hear when its too loud. Killer feature!
2023-03-28,You just explained the adaptive transparency mode 10x better than Apple did on stage! Great video!
2023-03-28,"These AirPods Pro have been a game changer for me, I am on a high school drumline and had the 1st generation Pro's that I used for noise canceling. This caused me to always have to have noise cancelation on and constantly have to take them in and out to hear my instructors comments. With the new AirPods I am able to keep transparency mode on. This means, when we're drumming and the loud noises are happening, the sound is reduced, however, the moment the drumming stops and our instructor starts talking, immediately I can hear him and everyone around me clearly. A game changer for drummers."
2025-02-25,Marques is the best video on the AirPods Pro 2 so far this convinced me to buy them! Anyone know a good quality leather case that will last a long time?

2023-03-28,Modern tech will never fail to amaze me. How they do all that in such a little device blows my little normal mind.
2023-03-28,the technology behind the ability for them to reduce noise is underrated asf. The signal processing there is on point.
2024-03-27,"One thing worth adding is that the AirPods Pro 2 integrate well with Android phones. As a Galaxy S23 user who previously was using Galaxy Buds2, AirPods work the same as in an iPhone for the features I use. Probably the only nice to have feature when connected to Android would be pausing the audio when removing one of the AirPods to speak to people but even that can be obsolete since you can just pause and enable transparency mode (which is out of this world). Would like to see Galaxy Buds improve to get on the AirPods level though."
2023-03-28,"I have to admit, I do dig this guy. Not for the Air Pod thing but the quality of his videos. He is really good at what he does. Nicely done."
2023-03-28,"Oh yes, that Watch the Throne test"
2023-03-28,"Just got mine and wore them at my local gym. at first I was thinking the ANC was about the same as my last pair of pro's, but then I took one out to chat with a friend and noticed how LOUD the gym was that day. Seriously impressed by these and I actually love that they were able to do it without changing the design which would have made them stand out more as a ""status symbol."" Thanks for the great review!"
2024-12-27,"Getting mine in the next 24 hours. Already bought them, your reviews are just that good… I’m still convinced they’re a good investment."
2023-03-28,"I tested the transparency in a loud environment and I was amazed. My girlfriend and friends like to go to loud bars and concerts, but because of my Autism I can’t handle the loud sounds like that but I always want to join. I occasionally went out with them using the last gen AirPods Pro and used noise canceling to help. But using the transparency mode on these second gens I can actually listen to the music and not get overstimulated due to the loud sounds. Worth the purchase"
2023-03-28,"I'm a musician in a rock cover band and wore these things this weekend at our gig and the transparency mode was absolutely amazing.  I'd never even tried using my first gen pro's but these, man the way they compress the loud sounds down to a normal decibel level into your ears is great.  I've resisted using in ear monitors for years because I hate not being able to ""hear the room"" and these new pro's fix that and my ears weren't ringing the next morning.  Bravo."
2023-03-28,"Just wanted to point out that personalized spatial audio is an iOS 16 feature, NOT an H2 exclusive. You can also set it up with gen 1 pros."
2023-03-28,Is it just me or does anyone else think he should be the one on stage for every Apple release? He is so clear and straight to the point hitting all of the key features that are so vaguely described by Apple themselves. Thanks for the time you take to do the research and always doing top notch tech reviews! Apple hire this guy and make him CEO!
2023-03-28,"Having gone to many rock concerts and having been in GA front and center, your description of experiencing a concert and feeling the bass in your chest without having to worry about the hearing damage (or having to use standard earplugs) sounds AMAZING"
2023-03-28,"As someone who uses these for work to cut out noise , the different between gen 1 to gen 2 is 100% noticeable , combined that with battery and better transparency it’s well worth the upgrade to me ."
2023-03-28,I like how Marques always conveys the target audience that a particular product is best suited for.. that’s an awesome detail in his videos!
2023-03-28,"I love these! Idk why I continue to watch reviews on things once I already have them, but if you’re someone with anxiety and it gets to a point where the world just feels like a lot…having everything get quite to almost nothing is so satisfying."
2023-03-28,"Marques is the GOAT of tech youtube, killer frisbee player, incredibly creative, and obviously very intelligent. That said, the way he repeatedly pronounced “ambulance” really threw me for a loop."
2023-03-28,"Just got my pair yesterday and the noise cancellation just blew my brains out. Never thought that noise cancellation was actually a technology thing as i thought that the silicone tips do the job but this proved me wrong. And watching this AGAIN would probably make me appreciate the transparency mode. 
I do love my pair and one of my best purchases so damn far."
2023-03-28,"Just picked up my pair today after considering it for a couple months…Super glad I did! The transparency mode alone is done really, really well. From someone that wears them 5-6 hours a day, 10/10"
2023-03-28,"I have to say, the presentation, the cadence, the clarity is what stood out the most on how to present and talk about a product. He kept you engaged without resorting to clickbait tactics. Well done sir."
2023-03-28,i love how relaxed he is with allthis info. thanks for not being like other youtube channels and shoving weird stuff at us and not explaning
2023-03-28,"This is honestly really cool to see. The gen 1 pros are already pretty good, and to see the 2s be even better is incredible"
2023-03-28,"Just got mine yesterday, and I have to say that there are a lot of improvement form the previous gen. The noise cancelling and transparency is fire. Also, if you love bass, definitely going to love it."
2024-03-27,"Bought these because of this review (I never had any AirPods before) and everything he says is spot-on.  I use them to cut my grass on a really loud riding mower that used to require earplugs, but with these on noise cancellation, the mower sounds like a tiny little electric mower.  It's almost unbelieveable how well they cancel noise, to the point where you feel like the mower couldn't possibly be running.  They also sound amazing with music or podcasts.  Really cool tech and I'm glad I got them."
2023-03-28,"As someone who works outside for 12 hours a day 6 days a week, transparency mode is very important to me and it’s all I use. This is great information!"
2023-03-28,"I took mine on a couple flights to Spain and Germany this week and was absolutely blown away by how good the ANC was! From just small little buds the sound of the plane vanished. Also pretty great for the underground spare a certain section of the jubilee line that hits 110dB normally. 
I bought these as I have big issues losing things (such as the case) but was very pleasantly surprised by just how much better they are than my original pros."
2023-03-28,"As someone who grew up in the 90s with cassette tapes on the radio and CDs, new tech these days never fail to amaze me. We’ve come so far in just such a short time!"
2024-03-27,"The noise cancellation is well worth the price, I’m hearing impaired so it’s more about cutting the noise versus turning up the volume, as a result, I can now hear things more clearly at lower volumes. I’ve heard new parts in songs that I’ve always listened to. I adopted taking these with me EVERYWHERE, at all times, especially movie theaters where they BLAST the sound; and toggle between transparency mode to flat out noise cancellation"
2023-03-28,"I watch this guy on various tech topics I'm not even interested in and find he ALWAYS makes it interesting and useful to the masses and nerds alike. The background research he does and the way he explains things is second to none, and I watch a lot of tech channels. He's the best of them."
2023-03-28,That transparency mode ear protection by lowering high decibels is game changer
2023-03-28,"Just copped my pair recently. When I first put them in , the noise cancellation is pre activated. I instantly felt an amazing feeling of ‘ calm ‘ and definitely loved the transition from noise to super quiet. 

For me , I enjoy quietness . These airpods are like gold heaven to me.

As I walked down the street and kicked the noise canceling in it was amazing. Cars were in motion but you couldn’t hear them."
2024-06-30,I have used Airpods for sound protection around loud engines and metal sawing. Very useful for communication while still protecting your hearing.
2023-03-28,"Thought I lost my first gen so bought the second gen. I noticed significantly better sound quality and anc. But the volume touch control is my favorite, it is really convenient and responsive. If you have the first gen I don't think upgrading is necessary."
2023-03-28,"I completely agree about the best new feature. Something amazing about my new AP2s is the adaptive transparency. To test this, I went into my wood shop with transparency on and used my miter saw. I actually thought it wasn’t working until I removed them and tried again. It was amazing and undetectable. 

I have special ear protection for my shop that has a similar feature, but there is a click when it suppresses the damaging sound. These AP2s are leaps and bounds above. I am VERY impressed."
2023-03-28,"I wore my AirPods Pro Gen 1 for hours on end for editing, music, videos etc and these new AirPods Pro 2 are insane with noise cancellation. Love the extra two hours of NC time as well"
2023-03-28,my friend bought these and let me try them out at work. I work at a movie theater and the concession stand gets extremely loud with the constant crowds of people and machines beeping/running but omg the noise cancellation cut out EVERYTHING i was in awe
2023-03-28,I used mine on a 6 hour (multiple) train journey yesterday. They lasted the whole trip door to door without taking them out of my ears. The transparency mode is seriously impressive it honestly sounds like you're not even wearing them. I replaced my Bose QC35's with these and don't think I'll be going back anytime soon.
2023-03-28,"Had the original airpods, they happened to just die yesterday. Went and picked the new ones up around 1 pm and have used em for about 8 hours since then. Absolutely love them! Can't speak to how much better they are than the pro's, but certainly an insane upgrade to the original airpods."
2023-03-28,Marques is my go to for tech reviews on youtube. Love the quality content and professionalism. Great review!
2024-05-01,"After 1 year of use I can confirm the following:- 
1- it’s getting better and better with the constant updates. 
2- almost flowless when it comes to connection to and b/w Mac & iPhone and Apple ecosystem. 
3- the battery still as good as new. 
4- it sounds pretty good and way better than any other AirPods I’ve tried. 
5- the only issue I had with it:- the in-ear wheezing sound after using it for a while. I don’t know if it’ll affect my ears health but it’s concerning for sure. 

I would give it 8/10 and it’s definitely worth it."
2023-03-28,I just ordered these today due to your review. You are the first channel I search when reviewing electronics and I value your honest opinion. Thank you!
2023-03-28,"I preordered mine and have been using them for a few days now. As someone who had the OG airpods and then the OG AirPods Pros since launch week, these are by far the best iteration of the technology we’ve seen since wireless earbuds. 

The sound is actually amazing considering everything being offered in the package. It’s clean, flat, punchy and just a beautiful listening experience. noise cancelling is like nothing else, and transparency mode was already unrivaled and now it’s so good it sounds like you’re wearing open back headphones. Battery life has been fantastic, improvements to the case are fantastic, touch volume is responsive and intuitive. Apple has once again outdone themselves with these earbuds. People will say they’re overpriced and not worth, but as someone who got thousands of listening hours out of my last pair, you couldn’t pay me to use a different brand. These things are supreme"
2023-03-28,I just lost my AirPods Pro (1st Gen) like a couple days ago. So I decided to pick up the 2nd Gen recently and….. man an immediate upgrade from the 1st Gen. The Noise Cancellation is insane and Transparency mode is incredible and really almost feels like the AirPods aren’t even there
2024-03-27,"My wife got me these for Christmas. I came to this video to get a better understanding on how they work. Coming from a pair of beats that are 10 years old, these pods blow my mind. They’re so good."
2023-03-28,Actually really appreciate this review. Just misplaced my AirPods Pro case last night and that made me want to get the new generation already. So to hear about the improved sound quality and NC is just pure icing on the cake.
2023-03-28,"I wear the pros all day and use them as hearing aids.  I love the noise cancellation on them to, and glad to hear these new ones are even better.  It’s so calming to turn off everything annoying.    Your reviews are always spot on."
2023-03-28,"I got a pair today after using (and eventually losing) 1st Gen AirPods Pro for a couple years. Turning on the noise cancellation just outside the store floored me just as much as the originals had.

They also sound really damn good, lol"
2024-12-27,"I work in the hotel industry working the night shift. My work allows me to wear my AirPods as long as transparency is on so i can hear stuff over the music. It’s awesome for hourly walks, i don’t have to take my AirPod out i can just pause my music and still hear. Never realised how much i rely on it"
2023-03-28,"I bought a set because of the attenuation in transparency mode. I play in a symphony orchestra for a living and am now middle-aged. I can wear these during rehearsals and hear what I need to hear without damage to my hearing. I hear enough to balance. Intonation and timing are not an issue for me. I am not sure these are for everyone in my situation, but they may have added four or five more years to my potential career. Good video. Thanks for doing such a good job in your reviews."
2023-03-28,"Apple outsmarted all of their competition when they decided to approach earbuds as a convenience product that would be developed into good audio equipment over time. They officially caught up with the competition in sound, and are still kings of features."
2023-03-28,"For the ear scan for personalised spatial audio i would recommend doing it a couple times until it sounds better, there is a huge difference between normal and spatial especially for orchestral classical sounds, another game changer."
2024-12-27,"The hearing aid feature and hearing test feature is insane, I love it,  to mention you can shake your head “no” to decline a phone call, and “yes” to answer it"
2023-03-28,"The better bass profile is going to be the main reason I upgrade to these from the last generation. I listen to pretty much only bass oriented music, as a bass producer, so I'm really happy to hear they did this. Great review."
2023-03-28,"I did just what you mentioned @MKBHD, I wore the Gen 1 AirPods Pro to a Duran Duran concert recently and actually just used the ANC. It cut the decibels by a bit more than half and I still thoroughly enjoyed the concert.
Agree with you that with the V2s it would be even more enjoyable 
Great review as always"
2023-03-28,I love how your videos are such honest reviews with a great balance between the pro’s & cons and how this product is just so spot on that your video has this overall sense of “Yup. These are on the ones”.
2024-03-27,8:05 Having done this a few concerts over the last year I can confirm that the Airpods are awesome at concerts. They don't muffle the audio and change the sound signature nearly as much as actual earplugs like the Loop earbuds which are also really good but not the same as active transparency.
2023-03-28,Can confirm everything you said. For me they are and kind of have been the gold standard for wireless earbuds. Sometimes I even wear them without anything playing just to reduce the noise level around me.
2023-03-28,"The transparency mode on the original Pro's never blew me away. I always feel like it makes traffic and other ambient noise way too loud but doesn't amplify things that I actually care about like people talking to me. For example, if I'm walking down the street in a busy city and I stop to talk to someone, I still have to take one APP out to have a regular conversation because the city noises are too loud."
2023-03-28,As somebody who started exercising these are a life saver.  I’ve used wired headphones ever since I was 13 and pulled countless cd players tape players and phones off the table or equipment I am working out on.  These things are a God send.
2024-03-27,I used the AirPod Pro 1 and now use the AirPods Pro 2 and I fully agree that the noise cancellation and sound quality is massively superior !
2023-03-28,That transparency mode is next level considering they have the technology to scale down high decibel sounds in real time. I wonder if that technology could be reversed for those with hearing impairments.
2023-03-28,This is the ONLY YouTuber who explained me the adaptive transparency mode in the most easiest way!!
2023-03-28,Just a heads up: the personalized spatial audio works on the original airpods pro as well and it's worked great for me.
2024-03-27,I just got these today. The noise cancellation is so good I thought I went deaf. I felt like I was in a womb. This is great.
2023-03-28,I’m so excited to get mine tomorrow. I work in loud environments and I’m glad to hear these are going to do what I thought they were going to do
2023-03-28,I'm so glad you decided to do this review. I had no idea that they had this many upgrades!
2023-03-28,"I bought a pair and I love them. I only don’t care for the softness of the plastic of the case. It scratches real easy,so what ever you have in your pockets scars the surface."
2024-03-27,"Wearing them at a concert is the best idea ever. I was always annoyed with my earplugs. It protects my hearing, but I miss out so much.. the crowd around me, the proper sound of the music that's playing. And I'd still do it because my hearing is more important than that, but if AirPods 2 would work with that - that would be a huge game changer, I fully agree with you"
2023-03-28,"Listening to this on my new AirPods Pro 2nd gen’s that came in today and I can confirm: the transparency mode is next level. Not only is the adaptive transparency mode thing great, but what I also noticed is vastly improved is the whatever adaptive EQ’ing they are doing. Now, I literally cannot tell if I have the AirPods in on transparency mode or if they are just not in unless I am myself speaking. When I am speaking, I hear more highs in my voice than I would without the AirPods in. Really incredible, though. And yes, the noise cancelling is much better too. Very happy with my purchase.

My comparisons are to my wife’s AirPods Pro 1st gens that I used for the last month leading up to getting these."
2023-03-28,"For a reference, the concert idea would work I believe.  As a piccolo player, I once used my airpod pro 1's to block out the sound, and they worked magnificently!"
2023-03-28,"I just bought a pair of these, and they do sound better than my previous Air pods Pro, however, the volume controls on the stalks don't work as smoothly as I thought. I wish they had put the volume controls on the OUTSIDE of the stalks. Other than that, I feel they are a major upgrade."
2024-05-01,I never heard anyone giving such a comprehensive laying out of specs on any electronic gadget!!  Thank you for laying out such a clear picture for all
2023-03-28,"I just picked up some yesterday after my 1st gens stopped working, and omg they’re so much better than the 1st Gen. The sound quality and the improvements to noise cancellation and transparency is crazy. The option to change the volume on the stem is a nice touch"
2023-03-28,Marques deserves  an  award.He really takes his time and makes sure he delivers top notch content:)
2023-03-28,I use the current airpod pro in my workshop as they work pretty well at cancelling the machines loud noise while also allowing me to hear them for safety. So this sounds like a great upgrade.
2024-03-27,"Just bought mine recently. The ANC is definitely miles better. What will eventually concern me is the problem I had with the 1st Gen APsP where the sound drivers would just completely degrade to the point that they introduce a ton of peripheral sound as static and vibrate the earbuds while they're in my ear. My last ones sounded so incredibly hollow as a result of this on top of the static.

And these were the third pair I had to go through warranty for the same problem before effectively being convinced to just buy the new gen."
2023-03-28,That adaptive transparency feature sounds a lot like the electronic headphone noise cancellation that is in the headphones that are used for sport shooting. They let you amplify the sounds around you while simultaneously damping sudden sounds like gunshots and bangs.
2023-03-28,"The noise canceling and transparency modes are great for races.  I wore mine to the Rolex 24, where you want to hear the cars racing, but it's too loud to stay at the track without some ear protection, and they worked great!"
2023-03-28,"This is a game changer! I love my Airpods Pro 1st gen, they are holding pretty strong after more than 2 years, and these improvements on 2nd gen seems to be better than what I expected"
2024-05-31,"Marques I did wear my AirPods Pro 2 to a whole-day music festival wherein I was front row right in front of the huge speakers and it worked!!!! I would hear the music so well but at a more comfortable volume for my ears (like I couldn’t believe how the people around me could not go deaf with the loud sound! ) I also noticed that my Apple Watch would only notify me of the loud noise only whenever I would take off my AirPods. In short,  it knows that I took it off so it warned me about the loud sound level. Haters gonna hate but I love the Apple ecosystem!"
2023-03-28,"Coming from my 3 year old AirPods gen 2, these were such a big improvement.  Still getting used to the ear tips.   But I’m having a lot of fun experience with the noise cancellation, on my way into the city."
2023-03-28,It's really cool that the engraving also displays on your iPhone
2023-03-28,Got mine a couple days ago and Marquees is absolutely right. I notice the difference as an owner of the 1st generation Pro. The volume control for me is the best because I no longer have to reach my iPhone in the pocket while walking my dog. 2nd best feature is the improved noise cancellation and Adaptive Transparency mode!
2023-03-28,"You’ve become my “one stop shop” for reviews when I’m looking to purchase a new Apple product.
I recently purchased an iPad Pro based on your review and Apples pricing ladder! 
I’m now going to buy AirPod pro 2's."
2023-03-28,"As someone who uses small engines frequently at work, the Airpods Pro have been an absolute gamechanger. I may look into upgrade to these."
2023-03-28,"This is why MKBHD is one of the top reviewers, he makes a review like a story. An amazing script here, very tallented."
2023-03-28,"The two main things for me is the massively improved noise cancellation; I can wear these in a loud gym and get almost no noise bleed at all, and the far more organic sounding transparency mode."
2024-03-27,Your reviews are always crisp and succinct.  Thank you.
2023-03-28,Bought them last Friday. I saw Flume live on Saturday …you’re absolutely right. Adaptive transparency is leagues beyond the competition!
2023-03-28,I tried the concert transparency mode thing. It works so well
2023-03-28,"Been using these for the last 4 days, and I can say, major improvement I’ve the 1st gen. Absolutely blown away by how awesome the ANC is and the spatial audio is just killing it.

It’s an experience worth investing into. The old one’s go to my brother coz I upgraded now"
2024-03-27,"I recently bought these because I broke my left one from 1st gen and the right one’s mic was essentially broken so I decided to splurge a little (a lot) and get these and tbh I’m loving them, the noise cancellation is perfect for when I have the fans going at night or when I’m on break at work and have the AC going in the car and the transparency mode is amazing when I’m talking to my wife or if I’m at work and someone on the job needs something or I’m on the scissor lift and need to hear if someone is calling for me 40 ft below me, here’s hoping they hold up to sweat and I can enjoy these for years to come"
2023-03-28,Adaptive Transparency mode is like Sunglasses for Noise.
2023-03-28,"Marques, your reviews are always informative and insightful. I was in the on the about these, but definitely picking them up as a xmas present to myself. Thanks for this great review."
2023-03-28,"Only review where you learn something new about the product, thanks Marques for your incredible work man!"
2024-03-27,Love your video!! Thank you  just got them as a gift & love the noise canceling effect
2023-03-28,"You create the most unbiased and detailed content around any device. Unlike people who just go ""i"" this ""i"" that so much so they put ""i"" in their name itself! Great work."
2023-03-28,I have used them at a concert (like in the example) and stood by the speakers. And I thought they weren’t turning it down that much. But then I took the AirPods out and it was crazy how amazing a job the AirPods were doing
2023-03-28,"I love this videos , straight to the point and coming of a stellar individual with amazing knowledge!"
2024-03-27,"finally upgrading to these from the first ever airpods  i am so excited

Edit: They did not disappoint"
2023-03-28,"Like others have mentioned, I’m watching this review while wearing my AirPods Pro 2 and I completely agree with everything said. I never tried the 1st gen, but have a variety of other things I use from original AirPods, Jabra’s, Sony WH1000-XM4, etc. Simply put, these will undoubtably be my most used from this point on. The combination of the sound, noise cancellation, and the extremely pleasant transparency mode add up to create a beautiful cocktail of a product  that will be coming with me every time I leave the house."
2023-03-28,"I was going to run down my old pair since they got replaced not long ago, but dang the new ones sound amazing to me and considering how much I use them it’s worth the upgrade"
2023-03-28,"I've only had mine for a little over 24 hours at this point and have to say that they are pretty solid. Have a few flights coming in less than a month and excited to see how to noise cancellation works in that environment. 

I'm also noticing a frequent ""I was not going to review these, but ....."" trend going on with AirPod Pro 2 videos this week ."
2025-02-25,Just bought these used yesterday at a store! Used them yesterday at work and went to the same store to sell my Beats Studio buds today! Now I’m here to find the tricks and secrets to them.
2023-03-28,"I’ve been using AirPods Pro (1) for concerts since day one. Works really well. I’m afraid the adaptive nature of AirPods Pro (2) will change the sound too much in an adaptive manner though, for concerts? I guess I just have to try it. I’d love if they introduced concert mode."
2023-03-28,"I have been to a concert with these yesterday
it is ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE"
2023-03-28,"Got the new Airpods Pro at launch and I was also pretty blown away by how much better they are in just about every way. The stem volume control was a bit disappointing though, I was hoping it would be more granular. But it's there and it works."
2024-03-27,"Thanks my man, I know this is a year old review, but it was so thorough that I’m buying them now.  Just lost my old ones"
2023-03-28,Great review. I agree that the new AirPods Pro 2 are a significant upgrade. However I would like to point out the AirPods Pro 1 sell for $180 at most major retailers vs $240-$250 for the new ones which makes the choice a little less clear.
2023-03-28,"i just bought a pair over the weekend and i am loving them so much. the improved battery life, amazing bass and crisp clear sound is incredible. the improved transparency and noise cancellation is crazy good too."
2023-03-28,"I actually use the transparency mode of my Airpods Pro 1st Gen and boosted the passthrough volume in my accessibility settings to allow me to hear my professor easier!! Its actually very useful and I use it very often. They are basically hearing aids that play music, how neat haha"
2024-03-27,This is what I needed to hear to get them. My sensory is noise. I wore out my last AirPod pro after four years because of how much I wore them. I don’t drive and walk everywhere. The adaptive transparency would help me. Sometimes I don’t even listen to music.
2023-03-28,"I’m 14 years old,I used like 40% of my 5 month savings to buy these AirPods Pro’s and I didn’t regret it,it’s also my first AirPods that I got"
2023-03-28,I bought them a week ago and i am more then satisfied. I had a pair on airpods gen. 2 before so an upgrade was necessary lol. I love the noise canceling and sound. The sound is really comforting. I fit only the extra small tips so i found this very good. Also switching from like i said the airpods 2 i loved that the case kind of flips up and stays there. The controls are AWESOME. Like i love it. No more tapping em. Can definitely recommend but if youre more on a budget theres equally good or even better for less money.
2023-03-28,"Great review, noise cancellation on these are crazy good. I honestly thought Apple was making things up with the “up to 2X more noise cancellation”, but after having these for a bit that may be accurate. Bass sounds a lot better especially in transparency mode. Overall sound is better. Surprised, but happy they didn’t raise the price of these."
2024-03-27,I’m getting my first set of AirPods today and stumbled across your review. I’m really glad I discovered you! You’re easy listen to and provide great information! Thanks so much!
2023-03-28,"the volume control has become much more of a light flick for me, it’s responsive enough that you don’t really need to slide that much"
2023-03-28,I gotta get these. First apple headphones ever for me.
2023-03-28,"Two things:
1) The concert/ear plug idea: As far as I know it hasn't yet been conclusively proven that the inverted soundwaves used in ANC actually help with hearing damage. So in that case, you'd maybe just hear the concert less loudly, but it would still result in the same amplitudes in your cochlea and damage your hearing just the same. I mean, it'd be awesome, but I don't think we're ready to get to that conclusion yet.
2) The animation explaining the soundwave and the ambulance is not really correct: Given the axes that are usually used in soundwave portrayal, you just shifted the frequency down, (x-axis) without changing/limiting the amplitude (y-axis)."
2024-03-27,Very useful pocket size gadget when in need of some quietness.
2023-03-28,I'm honestly keen to see how transparency will reduce the loudness of a concert without trimming high frequencies like earplugs do.
2023-03-28,"Yeah, they are damn good. I did a shootout this past Sunday with these, Galaxy Buds Pro 2, S22 Ultra and iPhone 12. They came out on top. What surprised me was how good they sounded on my S22 Ultra compared to the 1st gen. They sounded better on the S22 than they did on the iPhone 12"
2023-03-28,"I was superbly impressed. I honestly just bought them because I was starting to get a bit underwhelmed by the noise cancellation on my Gen 1s and wanted the improvement. However...WOW. Sound really does take a big leap, the noise cancellation is frighteningly good (I blasted a YouTube video on my 2021 16"" MacBook Pro and it chopped the noise down to like 15%), and the adaptive transparency mode is also really good. I found the gesture for volume control to be fidgety, but it didn't cross my mind to just grip the AirPods on both sides and slide down instead of whatever dinosaur-claw gesture I was doing.

Even if you have Gen 1 Pros, definitely get these. They're awesome."
2024-03-27,I watched your review before buying...thank you for the honest review; I'm now a fan of airpods
2023-03-28,"i havent had the 1st gen pros but upgrading from the 2nd gens to these the noise cancellation is like my own white space, its mindblowing how ill just be in a classroom and it cancels out all the white noise + outside noise so i can focus better without having to have music playing and the transparency mode is just i dont think i have enough words to describe it, needless to say i never take them out of my ear."
2023-03-28,"I def am gonna need these, my watch goes off about 5-6 times a day with noise notifications… Easy buy for me"
2023-03-28,I'm curious how's the sound quality compared to the XM4  Would love a comparison video between these earphones!
2024-03-27,Bought these on a whim because I kept having issues with 3rd gen Airpods. They're fantastic!
2023-03-28,"Got mine today and after playing around with the tips, the ANC seems a lot better than before. Sound quality is the biggest improvement for me."
2023-03-28,"His intros never feel bored.
It's a great time for his fans having continuous videos"
2023-03-28,"I use transparency mode when filming live sessions with artists/bands - I genuinely didn't realise the work these AirPods were doing until by chance, I took them out whilst the band was sound checking.

The sudden jump in volume through my ears was startling! I was blown away at how they regulated loud sound, I use them every time I film with loud music acts now, so much easier to focus on my job, whilst still hearing what the band is playing !"
2024-06-30,Just got the Air Pro 2 . Thank you for your review .
2023-03-28,"8:34 whoah that scenario is an extremely good use-case for any earbud product. Hopefully you can test it in that scenario and let us know if they didn't just clip/distort and ruin the whole experience.
As an personal approach to protecting my hearing in abusively loud stages and clubs as a DJ, I invested close to $2000 on a musician-rated professional form of the same technology that Apple is now pioneering. The biggest difference being that my solution is wired and requires a belt pack with batteries. For anybody curious: Sensaphonics Active Ambient 3D is what I use. The sound is amazing (as it should be) and the microphones on the ear-buds can deal with the ridiculous volume levels musicians endure for hours on tours and stages across the world. Apple is definitely the only thing I've tried that has brought similar features to the consumer world, and it's extremely cool to see that they just raised the bar on an already awesome technology!"
2023-03-28,6:45 is the weirdest pronunciation of ambulance i have ever heard
2023-03-28,Who else is watching this with these Airpods
2023-03-28,Fantasic review. Thank you. I just bought some last weekend. They're my first pair. The noise cancellation feature sold me as soon as I heard it. Worth the price!
2023-03-28,"9:04 Geniunely thought it said ""not your airpods bro"""
2023-03-28,"Your explanation on the new transparency mode is better than what Apple told us on stage 

I got these new AirPods and I'm really impressed by the new noise cancellation, that does an amazing job, better than AirPods Max. And I prefer it over the Bose one that somehow feels ""oppressing"" for me"
2023-03-28,I am super impressed with the ANC on the Pro 2 when on a flight. It was amazing. And battery life is great.
2023-03-28,"I used the 1st pro version noise cancellation feature, inside a container vessel main engine area and near the diesel generators for 2h straight. imagine the crazy sound level. Airpods pro got me through this without even blinking and i could hear my colleagues talking to me with no real problem. I can't wait to see how this new transparency mode can work on other use cases."
2023-03-28,"I use beats fit pro, and the spatial audio personalisation is available for me as well. And I use iPhone 11. I think it has come with the iOS and not just the AirPods Pro 2. But it feels very different like you have mentioned. I like the fact that you go in detail with whatever I need to know with every device. Thank you"
2023-03-28,"I just got these for an early Christmas present today. I love them but I can’t figure out how to work the volume, play, pause or any of the features, lol. But I still love them."
2025-02-25,finally upgraded from pro 1s after 5 years!
2023-03-28,"I fly for work a lot. I love my air pods first gen but on those long flights, I'd still use my Bose QC 45. These seem like they might be at a level where I can just leave them in on a flight if I'd like. Thanks for an awesome review."
2023-03-28,1:26 just want to clarify that these do NOT support 16 bit 48khz since that would be lossless.
2023-03-28,"Great video! I just got my first pair of Air Pod's, love them!"
2023-03-28,"Thanks for the great review and break down! I'm an ""Airpods Person"" and also a wedding photographer. Your idea at the end about wearing these in Transparency mode at loud concerts illuminated a lightbulb in my head that I need to upgrade to v2, and wear them during the loud dance music every night! I have suffered from hearing loss and have tinnitus from loud sound exposure, so I will definitely start trying this and see how it works. Great idea and thanks for sharing!"
2023-03-28,"Consider AirPods Pro, too, as a legitimate and indispensable work device. You mention that you’d never have ear buds in for 6 hours straight and while I agree that would be a big no-no for consumption (such as watching videos, listening to music), I find not enough people talk about these little guys for their professional benefit.  I bought the first AirPods Pro specifically to teach online courses when the pandemic hit, and use them for every video call, virtual meeting, and phone call (choosing the Pros for the ability to switch between transparency and noise cancellation mode so I can still hear myself when I talk but then can shut out sound when I need to focus). This is the only device I can comfortably work in all day.  1000% a life-changer."
2023-03-28,"In my 2 minutes of experience with them, the ANC was comparable to that of my old Bose headphones'. That's actually scarily surprising to me"
2024-03-27,Really love to watch your opinion on electronics and love the way you describe.. You’re so convincing that I went and bought it for myself  and I am completely agreeing with you they are amazing the noise cancellation is mind blowing
2024-03-27,Great review. I have the new AirPod pro 2 and I love them but I didn’t know how to explain to people how good they are. This is this perfect review for it
2023-03-28,"Agreed on all counts! Love the new pros. At first they don’t feel like an exciting upgrade since they feel and look literally the same, but every upgrade on them is a good one. I’ve been dying for the AirTag features to be built into the case. No need to use an AirTag case on them like I did with my old pros. Good review!"
2024-03-27,"I just got a pair of these. Noise cancelation seems to work a bit better than the Sony buds I had before. Transparency mode is nice, and the sound quality is great. I'm happy with them. Another good thing is that I don't have to plug them in, just plop them down on my magsafe charger. So much better."
2023-03-28,"When I tough your content can't get any better, it does.. The production quality and the actual content are out of this world, Marques! Keep it up!"
2025-02-25,The transparency mode on the pixel pro 2s is insanely good.
2023-03-28,I put in a order awhile back and they're coming in this weekend. So it's good to hear they are a substantial upgrade from the 1st gen. Especially with the music quality & transparency mode getting a nice boost
2023-03-28,"@mkhd the new ANC and Transparency mode are super awesome! I actually used it at a concert in the exactly same mode you suggested (before watching your review ), and man! It was just exactly as you had dreamt it! I was in the 3rd row from the front,  in front of the gigantic speaker and it sounded so much comfortable! Just blew my mind!"
2023-03-28,"So many MKBHD videos lately! Loving it
I really love watching about stuff I cannot afford."
2024-03-27,"The way he explained, the “adaptive transparency”mode is ridiculously amazing"
2023-03-28,"I've been wearing my last-gen Airpods Pro as a hearing aid, because transparency mode in that model is that good. Thinking about an upgrade now with these transparency mode upgrades. Even with my previous airpods pro purchase and purchase of new ones, I'm still out less $$ than if I purchase prescription hearing aids! Also, the Db limiter sounds like I should be able to wear them while duck hunting, which would be a bonus for me."
2023-03-28,you can absolutely do that at concerts. i use the pro 1s on noise canceling mode at concerts and it works perfect so im sure the adaptive mode will be just as good if not better. Also the ear scan function works with the 1st gen pros as well.
2023-03-28,Noise cancelation is magic! Love them.
2024-03-27,"Fantastic review. So much information cogently presented and clearly articulated. Your knowledge and expertise are awesome. Thanks for a great review. I just got the Apple AirPods Pro 2 for Christmas from my wife and I noticed the difference immediately and learned A LOT from your video. Fan for life, Marques."
2023-03-28,The biggest selling point to me the the noise cancellation. I work in huge data center environment which has lots of noise around. The first gen is working ok but still hearing noise when I step onto data floor. The 2nd gen gets much better and I can even have meeting on data floor troubleshooting things with vendor meeting which is nearly impossible on the 1st gen.
2023-03-28,Could you use transparency mode at a gun range? I know similar technology has existed for awhile for hunters and shooters
2023-03-28,"I’ve been using AirPods Pro to concerts and clubs anytime I forget my earplugs (which is half the time). I’m a bit self-conscious about having AirPods in in those situations, but honestly they work so much better than earplugs. I’ve always used noise cancellation but looking forward to getting these new ones and trying out the transparency mode. I think it will be useful in a loud city like Barcelona. Thanks for the review!"
2023-03-28,"I lost my old airpods case so ""is it worth the upgrade"" is kind of a moot point for me but I do still wanna know what Im getting that's better."
2023-03-28,"I had no plan to buy the new ones, then I lost the left one… and these new ones are miles ahead, the older ones were pretty trash, for sound quality, the anc was great when I bought them in sept 2021, but they lost their anc also after march 2022… the vocals and surround are incredible, if they had a lot more bass or came with an option to increase base, there would be no competition for these"
2023-03-28,"If the iPhone can be updated for as long as the Airpods Pro, I believe there will be huge changes every time."
2023-03-28,Apple just got another best seller in their hands now!
2024-03-27,"Honestly I just got my pair for my birthday (USB- C version thanks EU) and the differences are amazing! Top three has got to be sound, ANC, and the new adaptive transparency! It’s honestly super good, highly recommend. I have a flight soon, so I’ll probably be very grateful for the extra battery life, too. Especially with the Black Friday coming up soon I highly recommend picking up a pair!"
2023-03-28,"I like the volume up and volume down feature now, but I think they should have probably placed it where the black part is, and that could basically just be the slider, up and down for volume. Push a bit and slide up and down, the area it’s at now is kinda small to control volume, I don’t know if this makes sense but I hope someone understands what I’m sauing"
2023-03-28,"I used the AirPods Pro all day everyday basically. So I got the AirPods Pro 2 immediately and wow I’m impressed, the sound is so much better, and the noise cancellation blew me away, definitely happy with them"
2023-03-28,One thing I've always wondered about noise cancellation. Does it actually perfectly physically cancel out the sound waves (thereby providing proper hearing protection) or does it just do it close enough to trick your brain but your physical eardrums could still potentially be damaged by the too intense sound waves?
2024-03-27,"You always have some of the best, top notch, hyper professional videos. Very informative and honest.  Well done"
2023-03-28,"As a Samsung-exclusive user, the Airpods Pro is probably my favorite Apple product. I have plenty of different wireless earbuds (highly recommend the Tranya brand, btw), but I tend to look for my Airpods Pro after a while. I love the 3rd generation Airpods as well, and firmly believe that this should have been released as the 1st generation Airpods. I'm most likely going to be skipping the new Airpods Pro, but I'd be real jealous of those that do! That transparency mode is CRAZY."
2023-03-28,"2 thoughts I had while watching:
1: It would be interesting if they made a feature that cancels out repeated noise like loud computer fans or airplane sounds, but keeps transparency mode for like people talking to you. So basically it’s noise cancellation 90% of the time, but if someone it talking to you it’s transparency mode for just their voice
2: Im interested to see what upgrades they bring to the airpod maxes... if these new airpod pros were improved this much by the H2 chip, how much can the maxes be improved by the H2 chip?"
2023-03-28,"The Gen 1 AirPods Pro already have adaptive transparency. I know mine do. It must’ve come through an update and Apple just didn’t say anything about it. But mine definitely minimize environmental noise.

But damn it! I think you’ve convinced me to drop the cash and get the Gen 2s…. Hard to imagine a better pair of AirPods Pro but my biggest gripe is battery life so an extra 2 hours would be huge!"
2024-06-30,"i bought mine a few days ago and its lowk the best pair of headphones i bought, i used soundcore and jlab and the airpods are so nice to help u not have ur ears blow up from high db sounds"
2023-03-28,"Love the new transparency mode. Hated it in gen 1, but it’s so much better. I commute by bike and anne would have to ride with just one airpod in for safety, but now I can ride with both in transparency mode. I also use my AirPods as ear protection while shooting small calibers."
2023-03-28,"Been waiting on this review, feels like there's been a ton of noise cancelling headphones/earbuds in the last year"
2023-03-28,"I'm really impressed I wasn't going to upgrade as my 1st gen where only a year old, but I'm really impressed with how much better they sound, for me the speed at which the connect is huge."
2024-07-30,"Just upgraded my 2019 AirPods Pro, due to crackling noises on the right earpiece. I did turn them in in 2022 to get them fixed but 2 years later crackling came back. Bought the 2nd gen and I love them so far. My original AirPods Pro lasted 5 years hopefully these last for 5 years as well."
2023-03-28,"There is a bug where your AirPods tone volume preference is ignored while listening to music.
Sound effects will always play at full volume while something different is playing in the background. Any idea if there is a fix coming?

You can test it yourself by setting the Tone Volume to 15% and playing a YouTube video, while switching transparancy modes."
2023-03-28,"i""m still impressed each time i use them, i still got the gen 1 , but damn, the Spatial audio is way better imho , i've noticed that especially if your move your head up or down the sound stage will make you feel the difference , active transparency is awesome, at first i wasn't planning on getting these, but worth the upgrade ^^"
2024-12-27,Just bought one rn!
2025-02-25,(Im special needs where I can’t focus a lot) so my moms rewarding me when I get done with home school. I’m honestly just watching this cause I’m jealous rn
2023-03-28,"I think the Pros 2 will be perfect for me coming from the Max, the small form factor is good when going outside"
2023-03-28,"I loved my first pair of the pros, just got the new gen 2 pros for Christmas and I wear them for 10hr work days. I weld and they seem to do a good job with noise cancellation when welding, but they do get feedback when sanding and seem to be more sensitive to high pitch noises when walking by air nozzles and air grinders in use compared to the gen 1 pros"
2024-03-27,MKHB does an amazing job in highlighting all the features and perhaps enabling an individual in making an informed decision when choosing what to buy.
2024-03-27,Best AirPods girl got them for me for Christmas man I love them I swear
2024-09-28,"0:54 The only way I can tell the difference between the original is if you look at the black thing where the silicone earpiece is, it’s smaller"
2023-03-28,"Question. I'm a huge music fan and I have tried the AirPods Pro 2 for a couple of minutes. But I have a problem with buds as far as comfort goes. I'm generally an over the ear headphone guy but after testing these out even for 2 minutes, they sounded almost as good as AirPods MAX. I usually use the large tips for a tight fit and to not lose bass. How long do you think you can wear these without them becoming uncomfortable? Thanks in advance. Great Review as always."
2024-03-27,"Speaking as one of your “AirPods people,” this was an excellent review! I was considering treating myself to these as an upgrade for summer, and your video helped me decide it would be a sound investment (BA DUM TISH)

Also, SUBBED, because these are exactly the types of tech videos I love to see when considering a purchase. Thanks! Keep up the fabulous work"
2023-03-28,"0:38
I knew there was a but coming"
2024-07-30,I never understood the transparency mode but when I do now I am really amazed that’s really brilliant
2023-03-28,Just got these and man! They’re amazing…
2024-07-30,who’s here after buying them on prime day
2024-03-27,"Transparancy mode, and ANC for that matter too, has definitely drastically improved over the airpods pro gen 1"
2024-03-27,Started my first job a few months ago and I finally picked up a pair last night. I absolutely LOVE these! Noise cancellation works far beyond any other earbuds I’ve used and the first couple of times honestly gave me chills. It’s crazy how clear someone sounds while having the earbuds on. Sound quality is great. Listened to some Metallica last night and even tried out the Spatial Audio. It was pretty fun but I don’t see myself using that feature long term. All in all great pair of buds! Having some of the AirTag functionality built in is very relieving. I would be terrified to take these outdoors without that(not that I lose my stuff but they’re tiny and expensive asf so I just wouldn’t trust it lol)
2023-03-28,"Loving mine and it really is a noticeable difference with noise cancelling compared to the Pro 1.  One thing I still have a gripe about is call quality when out and about - just like the 1’s, it still has issues with cancelling surrounding noise during calls while picking up the voice properly."
2023-03-28,"Marques, please tell me: Does the improved ""Adaptive Transparency"" reduce wind noise compared to the previous AirPods Pro? The whooshing and static-like wind noise is the most unnatural thing about transparency mode in my opinion. It's annoying when I'm outside (like on a run) with my AirPods in. LTT reviewed some ear buds a little while ago that featured reduced wind noise in transparency mode and since then I've wished my AirPods did that. I haven't heard anyone comment on wind noise with these new AirPods and I'm really curious!"
2023-03-28,"Been using these for a week now and I can confirm that these are way better than I expected! They won’t replace my over ear headphones but, as far as ear buds go these are really good."
2024-06-30,"I love my AirPods Pro 2. Hands down well worth the money. I gave my mom my gen 1 when I upgraded. She couldn’t understand how I could spend that much money on headphones. Once she had her a pair, she never looked back. She agrees now that they’re worth the money too and even upgraded herself to gen 2."
2024-11-27,just came here to justify my purchase HAHA
2023-03-28,Been waiting for this
2023-03-28,"Your videos are so freakin good, it’s unbelievable. You and your team are KILLING it. Kudos for your constantly amazing content  

Now, these AirPods Pro 2 are speechless. I was in love with the first gen AirPods Pro but unfortunately had to sell them because the smallest ear tips were still too big for my ear holes.
Now that these come with XS ear tips, I have no words to express my joy to get to buy them again"
2023-03-28,Needs improvements:  enable the total adjustable volume for the Transparency mode.
2023-03-28,We’ve had insane decibel reduction tech for a long time in the firearms community.
2023-03-28,The game changer for me was the volume control. Loosing that feature really killed me.
2023-03-28,That adaptive transparency visualisation
2024-07-30,Had to come and watch this video. I left my AirPods home and was too far away to turn back. I stopped and bought these with plans to return them after my trip. Within seconds I noticed how much better they sounded than my 1st gen pro. Now I’m keeping them
2023-03-28,"Personalised Spatial Audio was really good for me. Idk if it's because both my ears are heavily different but when I did the scan, I actually hear a balance in volume on both ears. It used to be louder on my right ear and softer on my left one even though they were both on the same volume."
2023-03-28,"BE CAREFUL: Noise cancelation DOES NOT prevent ear damage. The sound pressure is usually kept, even though the volume is not. Using AirPods in transparency might FEEL lower than just using it as an earplug, but it will NOT prevent damage. Use musician’s earplugs on shows, they dampen all frequencies more or less the same, so they don’t hinder your enjoyment, while actually lowering the volume to safe levels."
2023-03-28,01:46 finally someone says it.
2024-03-27,got some on Black Friday i was happy
2023-03-28,at 5:00 he says air buds
2023-03-28,"The personalized spatial audio thing works with the first generation AirPods Pro too; my phone prompted me to do the scan as soon as I installed iOS 16 on my 13 Pro Max. 

That said, if the noise cancellation truly is that much better than first-gen, I'll definitely be upgrading. I use mine a lot around noisy tools and equipment, so even better hearing protection is a welcomed addition."
2023-03-28,Worth upgrading from Airpods pro 1 to 2?
2024-03-27,"8:35 as someone who’s been working In the event industry this feature is something that I’ve dreamed of, I used my previous gen air pods pro for this type of scenario but it didn’t work well. Always had to be in noise canceling mode. But this new version that can bring those high frequencies down in real time is so clutch!"
2024-03-27,What kind of filter is he holding at 3:14?! How can it see through the plastic?
2024-12-27,"Just came here to justify my purchase, got them for 45 GBP on ebay"
2023-03-28,"I like reviews like this, amazing detail and description on it. Thanks Marques. 
As a Samsung user I can only say that, I wish Samsung could get close to the level of improvement and evolution Apple always brings to their devices."
2024-03-27,My 1st Gen Pros blew out after 3 years. I just upgraded to 2nd Gen Pros on sale for $200. Worth it
2023-03-28,"I have avoided AirPods for years because of the inferior sound quality - they were just overpriced ear dongles, more fashion than function. But I recently tested (and have now acquired) a pair of AirPods Pro 2 for my self. And holy smokes I love them. Everything you said is spot on. The sound quality, transparency mode, noise cancelling, seamless iPhone integration, all done brilliantly."
2024-11-27,Hearing aid feature just saved me $1700
2023-03-28,10:25  can we get a like for  all my fellow AirPods people
2024-03-27,As someone born in the 90s this is amazing I just ordered mine from target $180
2023-03-28,can the next wireless earbuds you review be the nothing ear stick. i really like how in depth your reviews go and to be honest the only reason i haven't gotten me a pair already is because i'm waiting for your review on them.
2024-10-28,Ya don’t wear these in the 1st row of a concert. You’ll damage the AirPods lol. To high of a DB will destroy your noise cancelation
2023-03-28,"Hard to justify an upgrade when my current Pro's still work great, maybe in the future!"
2024-03-27,"Just ordered a pair, should be delivered today in 2 hours… let’s see how they compare to the 1st gen… 
Thanks for awesome content"
2023-03-28,does anyone know the wireless charger he is using at 3:08
2023-03-28,2:08 Medium is me - that’s what she said
2023-03-28,4:04 skip to this
12  ago,It should also be mentioned that even if they are noise-cancelling that does not mean that they protect your hearing during flights and whatnot. Traditional over-ear headphones would do a much better job at protecting you and making sure those extra decibels don't damage your hearing.
2024-06-30,Ambyu-Lance?
2024-11-27,It says this was filmed 2yrs ago 🫤
2023-03-28,"0:01 
Red hydrogen one shirt?"
2024-03-27,You did it again. Simple yet instructive.
2023-03-28,"This was the most stressful video, after every update you are expecting him to finally tell you what the underrated feature is, but instead it keeps nagging you on. I really didn't enjoy that. this is my opinion."
2025-02-25,Here to see if my air pods are supposed to make a bell noise when I open them
2024-05-01,9:45 - a little bit whiter
2025-02-25,"Son of a sound engineer here, the transparency mode will not protect you from hearing damage, no ANC ever will, to get proper protection you need passive protection like with earplugs. ANC tricks your ears into thinking things are quieter, and while they are and it can be pleasant, it won’t do anything to specifically protect you against hearing damage."
2023-03-28,
2025-01-26,I am giving away Apple AirPod Pro.
2024-03-27,"The GOAT of tech reviews. Saving us all a bunch of time making wrong tech buys,"
2023-03-28,"Got them yesterday, first ever pair of in-ear that can fit my TINY ear canals perfectly. Not going back! Not having to wear my headset to sleep is a bliss! 

Highly recommend!"
2024-05-31,Just got these on sale at Best Buy mainly for the noise cancelling. Over the last 4+ years I've tried a half dozen plus different knock off earbuds and headphones and I'm very surprised by how loud and quality the sound is for how tiny they are. The adaptive listening and Spatial Audio is surprisingly good and noise canceling is great. The charging case is very small and barely noticeable in my pocket with my phone. With the sale at Best Buy I got them with Apple Care+ for 2 years still substantially cheaper than MSRP. Initial impressions are I'm very impressed as someone who has used Bose QC for probably a decade. Great buds If you can get them on sale. I'd say if they are not on sale I wouldn't have spent my money.
2024-03-27,I’m getting mine today so this helped give me some expectations and also an easy review to understand what’s changed from the AirPods Pro to the 2nd Gen. Thank you!
2023-03-28,i had been fighting the urge for a couple days now… n then i came across this video… Marques i trust u too much man
2023-03-28,Got a pair a few months ago basically free (credit card pts that were about to expire) - they are very very good. For all his reasons. And 1 he probably mentioned in his review of the originals - the silicone tips instead of rubber make them incredibly comfortable. Most buds annoy my ears after 30-45 minutes. No problem with these.
2024-05-31,"Just got these cuz I lost my og AirPods Pro’s. The ogs sounded good but these are on another level, like how is that even possible"
2024-03-27,Just switched from my old AirPods 1st gen to this ones and I was literally stunned
2024-03-27,All the info I was looking for without the  = Thank you.
2024-03-27,"I have the Airpods Pro also since day 1. On top I have the Sony WF-1000XM4. I use both headphones, usually the Sonys for sports with music and the Airpods for walking the dog and when I need the transparent feature. I have the Sonys since 1,5 years and the battery of the left earbud is now dying. The Airpods Batterys are still better, even if they are far older. Thumps up for the Airpods Pro, I wish I would not loose them when I am sweaty and I wish they had Sonys Sound quality."
2024-03-27,I bought them thanks to your video!!Same goes for the MacBook Pro and iPhone 15 Pro for which I watched your review videos. Thank you Marques for always sharing professional content for us!!
2023-03-28,"I will be upgrading to these tomorrow from the Airpods 2nd gen.  My boss has the original Pros and loves them.  I feel like a kid at Christmas.  I look forward to being able to wear both at the same time at work with the transparency mode.  With my current ones, I had to keep one out so I could hear customers come into the shop and listen for the shop phone to ring."
2024-03-27,"Just ordered these as an upgrade over my first gens, giving the older ones to my sister, very excited to hear how they sound in comparison! Also looking forward to hearing the ANC improvements."
2023-03-28,I bought a pair today and someone with paranoid personality going out I hate it I love the noise cancellation it puts my disorder at ease at bit and my anxiety isn’t as bad
2024-07-30,"I’ve been using the AirPods 2nd gen, and I’ve been having problems. I’ve had them since 2022 and I LOVE them until I started having problems. My right AirPod seems louder than my left and my right AirPod won’t stop slipping out my air a lot. I wanted AirPods that wouldn’t move so much and stay great for a longer duration of time. I should have mine very soon and I am excited."
2024-03-27,"I just bought these and they are so incredibly balanced!! Light as a FEATHER, insane battery life, they seal and fit securely in my ears like every apple earbud ever has, the passthrough is incredible, it's like I'm not wearing earbuds at all, AND they actually sound pretty friggin good!! I did have to do some eqing, did a basic U, bumping bass and treble and reducing the muddy mids."
2024-03-27,"I had the original airpods pro in 2020. we were doing ballistic breaching indoors. so I put my airpods in and turned on noise cancelling. I was 10 feet from the door when the shotgun went off. I felt the overpressure, but heard a deadened thud from the muzzle. for some reason my airpods stopped working fully..... hahaha. hopefully the airpods pro 2 fixed that. I have some ringing in my ears now.... but thats from decades of rock and metal concerts."
2024-03-27,"I just got the Airpods Pro 2 for christmas, so excited!"
2024-03-27,"Something that should be mentioned is that the production quality, is not that good. For instance lines or seams, that sometimes look like cracks from day one. When you take them back to apple they do not replace them since they consider them as cosmetic damages. You pay 259 dollars and you get a product with cosmetic damages. Fantastic!"
2024-03-27,"Honestly the lanyard loop is the main reason I want one, now I can get rid of the chunky case that only on there so I can attach a apple tag"
2024-03-27,It's really a good review. Congratulations!
2024-03-27,I’m currently in a factory working I die when I would accidentally turn transparency mode. I got the gen 2s and just switched over as he was talking about it… wow actually impressive
2024-03-27,Excellent product again. Just got these recently and they’re a decent upgrade on something I didn’t think could be better
2024-03-27,"Just bought my pair today and going to be selling my 1st generation pros when they come in the mail, can’t wait"
2024-03-27,I watched too many videos related to this and I am very much convinced by the explanation .. very good for beginners .. Simple and clear
2024-03-27,Got these on sale during Prime day. Not disappointed
2024-07-30,"I just got these, and I am definitely one of the “AirPods people” that looooove wearing these constantly"
2023-03-28,"7:02 this is very nice when you are using transparency mod for safety, but you cant hear honking :)"
2024-03-27,Got my AirPods Pro 2 yesterday
2024-07-30,i used airpods gen 1 as concert noise guards. they worked really well. had a concussion and went to a 100 gecs concert. sound was making my head hurt but i had my airpods so i put those in and had a blast. everything was super clear rather than harsh and abrasive like normal concert sound is like.
2024-05-01,Dang I’ve bought the AirPod pros 2019 but wow they’ve improved so much
2024-05-31,My dad brought me a AirPods Pro 2 but I really love Spatial Audio head tracking it’s da best
2024-12-27,I’m here trying to decide if it’s time to upgrade my AirPods Pro 1 from 2020.
2024-03-27,"I like them, but they perform the best when either transparrancy and NC disabled. I can hear that I get more dynamic details in the upper highs when they play as neutral as posssible."
2024-03-27,This is a really well written review
2024-03-27,"As an older person, I would love them to have a switch to make also make them hearing aids in this form factor and use a phone app to fine tune the frequencies my hearing needs."
2024-03-27,I was in the club with my AirPods Pro 1. With noise cancellation the loud music got cancelled and I could hear the person next to me so clearly every one else was shouting to have a conversation but I could hear him clearly without having to shout.
2024-10-28,Just bought these after my 2020 app1 stopped working. Best purchase I’ve ever made.
2024-07-30,"You’re very good at reviews. Thank you! I’m glad these are good, I was debating."
2024-12-27,"I just wish the microphone can get to the level of those audio improvements because yeah, we use them for having calms while on the street or coffee shops"
2024-03-27,I just got these and they’re incredible!! I’m super impressed. Apple did it again!!
2024-03-27,"I cannot understand why Apple has even hi-res on Apple Music, but their best in-ear buds only reach 16 bit. It doesn’t make sense. Nevertheless I’m quite happy with the sounding of the AirPods 2 (no pro model). Also I have a hi res device and a Grado labs headphones to compare, no doubt Apple does a good job with the AirPods"
2024-05-31,"Apart from the better sound, the case with sound and find my....what I really like is that I can tell the charging level on both ear pods and the case in the battery widget on the iPhone, no need to open the case next to the iPhone.
Over all much better than the originals, which I had for 4 years"
2024-12-27,Just got these for Christmas
2024-03-27,"I’ve been thinking to get them and I’ve been wating for them to arrive , this video just convinced me that I’ve got the best and got to learn about its specifications also ."
2023-03-28,But do they crap out after a few months like the 6/6 pairs of AirPods Pro 1st gen I’ve been through?
2024-03-27,You forgot to mention that the lanyard loop doubles as an antenna
2023-03-28,I wear these on trains and at concerts. Mind-blowing difference
2024-11-27,"Thank you for this review! I just bought them to use as a hearing aid. That’s another amazing aspect of these AirPods. I am still getting used to them, but I appreciate your review!"
2024-03-27,"Wow! You are so great, I have them since 2 months and learned a few new things from you!"
2024-03-27,"Airpods are the closest thing to the implants we were promised in Sci-Fi. In transparency mode, they can interact privately with you without affecting your hearing. Now we just need Siri to get a lot smarter, pair her up with OpenAI and give it the ability to interact with web and location services. ""Siri, rent this scooter."" ""Siri, make a hotel reservation in Chicago for October 9th."" ""Sir, fetch me an Uber."" Pair them with glasses with a built-in camera and things start to get really crazy."
2024-03-27,I just ordered them this vid helped a lot in my choise
2024-03-27,"I love my AirPod Pro 1st generation, they became an indispensable item.  When they bite the dust, I look forward to getting these, or maybe AirPods Pro 3."
2024-03-27,This was very helpfull recommend this guy if u need a review about earphones
2024-03-27,The speaker on the case is extremely helpful
2024-03-27,What a great review as usual I just ordered mine today can't wait to try them I currently have the 1st generation  air pods pro
2024-03-27,"Go to a gun range and try how it (noise cancellation) is with different guns and calibers. That would be cool, and to compare with other similar earbuds"
2025-02-25,Thanks for validating my purchase.
2024-03-27,They should bring that transparency mode noise reduction to the military to decrease the noise of gunshots and explosions.
2025-01-26,"I have to say the only thing I don’t like is that when I sing along with the music I’m listening to and the conversation awareness is on, the volume goes down become the AirPods think  I’m talking to someone  so I kept it off most of the time I just love to sing"
2024-09-28,"I’m a tattoo artist that works at a music/tattoo festival in Ohio. And it’s mostly rock music slipknot, Korn, etc. and I can 100% confirm that the adaptive listening helped tremendously with the loud music. I can also say one of the main reasons I even thought to try it was because I shoot on a Pool League every week when I’m in the bar, I like to wear my AirPods, especially on karaoke night because, it makes it easier to hear the people that I am playing with a lot better and at the concert, I was tired of yell so I put in the AirPods for the same concept and it worked pretty well"
2024-03-27,@ 8:12. Absolutely & I use it now at live concerts or events. The previous did this bur this dies ir better & last longer.
2023-03-28,Thanks for this review! I had to order these because I unfortunately washed my gen 1 Pro’s and now one doesn’t work. But now I’m looking forward to the replacement for my expensive stupid mistake.
2024-03-27,I get mine tonight I’m so excited
2024-03-27,"Just got them today, and yeah, they are really good! The noise cancelation is crazy I can barely hear my thoughts when it's on, lol. It's otherwise really cool to be able to slide and change volume as well overall, really good purchase"
2024-03-27,I have or wear bluetooth headphones almost the whole work day for music or taking work calls and I always have to leave the seal half on or only have one earbud in so that I don't miss what my coworkers are saying (good friends of mine) while jamming music. This just looks like the best for me with the ambient stuff.
2025-03-13,I purchased these and these can also be used hearing aids. They are awesome. My mother even got a pair.
2024-03-27,6:36 … that “Adaptive Transparency” is already there in Galaxy Buds Pro!
2024-06-30,My Beats Studios just broke and I was sad then I got these today and I am so amazed by their capabilities.
2024-03-27,I’m happy to say I’ve been watching you since 2015
2024-03-27,I decided to upgrade from Pixel 6 Pro to an iPhone 15 Pro Max and I impulse bought these headphones. Extremely impressive. A league ahead of my old Pixel Buds
2024-05-01,What more can i do besides subscribing and liking vids to show my love for your channel. Great reviews
2024-03-27,"I love the iFixIt repair bag placement in the background of this video. 

A fantastic design company with some awful regard for repairability"
2024-03-27,The extra smalls fit me the best when I workout the small was falling out.
2023-03-28,Just got them a week ago had 2 pairs of the first Gen pros and it’s really a upgrade sound and clarity is much better on the new Gen
2023-03-28,"Thanks Marques, yeah they charge big money but deliver something different,more. Will buy it and it’s due to your review."
2024-03-27,"First time I've see this channel. Great presentation, subscribed!"
2024-05-01,"i have the pro  first generation and i just purchased the seconds, watching this makes me so happy i did! cant wait for them to arrive"
2024-11-27,2:33 danmmm that was so smooth
2024-03-27,The adaptive transparency mode is a really clever idea ngl
6  ago,Amazing review. Very professional. Very informative. Keep up the good work.
2024-05-31,"I would LOVE to see you do a video review of 3rd party tips for AirPods Pro 2 

There are SOOOOO many to choose from and I really value your opinion and appreciate your EXCELLENT reviews.

Foam Masters?
Sonicfoam?
Link Dream?
Lanwow?
Proof Labs?
Comply?
SpinFit?
CharJen?

I love AirPods Pro, but they just do not fit in my ear well, no matter which size tip I use from Apple.

Please consider doing this video. Thank you  

PS: I have many other earbuds with silicone tips. Some fit great, some not so great.

What seems to be the factor for me is how deep in my ear they go. The deeper the better. If they are too short and the fit is too shallow, they always seem to push out or fall out. 

My most comfortable pair are a cheap $20 Jlab Go Air Pop I got just to use at the gym, but now they are my favorite earbuds above even my AirPods Pro 2 which cost $250!

The only issue with the Jlabs are the mic is bad for phone calls. Other than that, these would be my ONLY earbuds and I'd be happy."
2023-03-28,I got these today and took them to work I work in a loud factory and it’s better then the ear plugs they give us to block out noise I love them
2024-05-01,"There are earplugs for loud music, they attennuate the whole frequency range evenly. You don't need computational audio for that."
2024-03-27,"Your reviews are the best, M!"
2023-03-28,"The AirPod pros one also do that with the transparency mode, and the blocking of like a loud horn or a loud hairdryer are of some noise that would hurt your ear at the time"
2024-03-27,"Update: I went to a concert and after a few hours when everything became overwhelming because of the state i was in (if you know you know xd), I put in my AirPods Pro 2 with transparancy mode and it worked! I heard just as much as before, but at a respectful volume. Might've gotten quite a lot of weird looks, but it was worth it."
2023-03-28,I just upgrade from first generation and the difference is huge. Love them
2024-09-28,"Coming here to decide between upgrading my old AirPods Pro 1 with only my right side working.. to either this or the new AirPods 4 ANC, and I think I’m making this choice thanks to you"
2024-05-01,Hands down the best tech reviewer ️ Alhamdulillah for MKBHD!
2024-03-27,"I went from AirPod second gen’s to AirPod pro second Gen, so no noise cancellation to top notch noice cancellation. So I can’t compare how much it has changed, but I can say this: my gf has a cold and at 1am I put in my pro 2’s with the noice cancellation on and it blocked out nearly all of her coughing/sneezing etc, my cat being mischievous after my gf’s cough woke him up, and the downstairs neighbor playing tv too loud. I was able to pass back out AND it didn’t hurt my ear to sleep on one side with the AirPods in."
2024-11-27,"after two years of using this model, I JUUUUUSSST discovered that I could adjust the volume using gestures!"
2024-03-27,"I have the 2nd gen, now planning to buy these"
2024-03-27,"I left my ear plugs at home when attending a dance party... I was lucky I had the AirPods 2 with me.  I used them as a quick fix and they worked well.  The bass still cut in a bit too much and it became Woofy.  Over a long duration these potentially would not be great for Tinnitus sufferers (if they have the low growly Tinnitus as iit was trying to cacnle the bass out but it was distorting and making it very loud in the buds, but when I moved further away from the speakers, these worked a treat and I felt my ears were protected.  In a fix, these can work as protective Ear Buds but they have a few quirks - depending on the intensity/volume of low frequencies, and how far away you are from the source (speakers in this case).  I hope this helps some of you out there with your decision making."
2024-05-01,Well I was gonna buy a gently used pair of Gen 2’s but looks like I’m going to spring for some Pros. Thanks for a great review!
2024-03-27,Yep I got it for the noise cancellation as well
2024-07-30,"They sound great , but the problem is they keep pausing for no reason , not good enough for the money   I’m going back to the traditional method, no charging and less chance of losing them"
2023-03-28,Good review. I never had a pair of AirPods before . now I want a pair. I was on the fence between the generation two and the AirPod Pro twos.. about the price and features. This explained a lot about the features
2024-03-27,Don’t forget that air pods also amplify outside noise kind of like a hearing air.
2024-03-27,Thank you for reviewing this i wanted to see if the new AirPods are worth it
2024-03-27,I’ve been using the original 2nd generation AirPods for a year. Wonder how much better these will be
2024-03-27,That's like a hybrid of Noise Cancelation with Transparency Mode awesome
2023-03-28,So I’m the only one that bought a brand new pair and the case won’t charge and then googled it with literally no results. Thank God I got my receipt
2024-03-27,"Since I bought this AirPod, my relationship with my wife has improved significantly thank to the transparency mode"
2024-06-30,I work a job where I get to listen to music. I used the old pros literally every single day for 8 hours every day and I have to say I literally don’t leave the house without them now. Just picked the new ones and I’m totally excited to try it out
2024-03-27,Just lost my airpods pro gen 1 and got the gen 2. Holy shit this is thing is actually good
2024-08-29,"Similar to the concert scenario, it’ll also be good for tuning after market audio systems at full tilt in a car too!"
2024-03-27,I love how you made sure to say “I don’t know exactly how much of the ear scan data was being used for this”
2023-03-28,"As someone who works in a warehouse, I’m excited to try out the new pros"
2024-03-27,I took my AirPods Pro 2 earbuds to the Full Moon Party in Koh Phangan in June 2023. The speakers along the beach were just blasting it and I decided to put my AirPods in my ears and it made the sounds on transparency mode sound a lot better and enjoyable. Still got people asking why I was wearing them at 2am.
2024-03-27,The ear scan also works on AirPods 1. Sounds amazing on AirPods 1 it’s a dramatic difference.
2024-11-27,To think of the performance of the H2 chip in one of the smallest devices is crazy
2024-03-27,"This is so helpful with useful information that helps me make a difficult decision.
Thank you, keep up the good work."
2024-03-27,"Since I’m lazy to read manuals, your video is my manual  thanks soooo much"
2024-03-27,"Just bought these today. Not sure why I didn’t go for the Pros straight away, the noise cancellation is amazing, as is the sound quality"
2023-03-28,"I just ordered some, getting here in Tuesday!"
2024-03-27,Thank you for this review.  You brought up interesting points and presented well.  I really appreciate that.
2024-03-27,Watching this with my new pros in.
2024-03-27,"You are very right, love your reviews"
2024-03-27,"Just got mine after having the 1st gen for 2 years it was time to upgrade, had a rattle in my right pod, an the left wouldn’t charge when put in case, I wanted the 2s those reasons made it super easy to make my decision and  love them"
2024-03-27,Thx for the review cause I am thinking about to buy them together with iPhone 14 Pro Max.
2024-03-27,"Been wanting a pair went to Walmart picked up a pair went home got ‘em synced up had mowing on the to do list hopped on the mower.. had to take the things out to be able to hear to get the choke/throttle right to start all while in a garage so the sounds tripled. Suckers are pretty wild, worth the money imo"
2024-03-27,I love the way you say Ambu-Lance
2024-03-27,Just got them today they’re amazing
2024-03-27,Can hardly wait for your review for the new ones!
2024-11-27,"Great video and you covered a lot of areas, but, I’m wondering if you synced these AirPods to a TV and tested how they respond to all the ANNOYING LOUD ads that we get bombarded with in commercials. Before I fork out $250 for listening devices, it would be nice to know how they work (or don’t work) with the various TV’s on the market.
My wife wears Siemens hearing aids and they sync with our TCL television so, she doesn’t have to wear headphones anymore. BUT, the hearing aids do not reduce the dB level of commercials. Based on your review, I’m thinking these AirPod Pro 2’s will do for commercials what you described in the video about sirens, jackhammers, etc.
Again, another great review of a great product!"
2023-03-28,"Ordered them yesterday after a huge love affair with the Airpods Pro 1. Super excited. You can fault Apple for so many things, and they might take a while to pick stuff up, but then they do it properly. I used to be on iPhone 3GS, then 4, then 4S, and then I went to Samsung. Note 2 LTE back then. After 12 horrible years of abusive software relationship by Samsung, I went to Pixel 4 XL, and then RoG Phone 4 (both of them have a VASTLY superior Android software), but then, after they finally introduced 120 Hz displays AND upped the Ram by 2 Gb, I went back to Apple. And I couldn't be happier. I've always loved the Apple ecosystem, and being back for the last 1 1/2 years has been an absolute pleasure."
2024-03-27,Just bought a pair Black Friday sale at Walmart was $185.90
2024-03-27,I wonder how the transparency mode would act at the shooting range. That would be cool to try. Ugh maybe I’ll buy them.
2024-03-27,the bass is so good on pro 2
2024-12-27,"had the first pros since launch still work ""fine""  just got the new ones. god I hope it's worth"
2024-05-01,"Noise cancellation, very clever tech and very useful! I get it! However, the EQ curve and the width perception of the sound stage has already been carefully thought out by the artist and the producer. I think most people would prefer to listen to the music as it was originally recorded without changing the sound with the interference of Apple's AI"
2023-03-28,Freaked me out when I put these on in the Best Buy parking lot. Everything was dead silent out of nowhere I didn’t know anything about the pros 2. I just wanted new AirPods after losing my gen 1’s and figured I might as well get the best ones. Had to take them off when I started driving because I could barely hear my super loud car.
2024-09-28,"id only owned first gen airpods before and when i got my pro 2s last year i have learned i literally cannot choose any other wireless earbuds other than my pro 2s. between the case having airtag find my features, the perfect amount of noise cancellation, and the fact that theyre the first pair of comfortable silicone tip earbuds ive ever tried ive literally never had such comfortable earbuds. i dont sing my praises for apple much bc they tend to do the bare minimum but i wont stop raving abt these until they make better ones"
2024-03-27,thanks for the review it really helped!! and you're so handsome bro
2024-10-28,These are really a major improvement over the first generation hands dwn!
2024-05-31,"Okay - I've been a Sony fanboy and loyalist for many many many years. Recently, my Sony equivelant earphones broke. I was pretty gutted. I was curious about the Pro 2's, I decided to get them to to give them a shot after this review. Well, I can honestly say these are incredible. Sony's sound customisation is fantastic, but these Pro 2's take it to another level. The adaptive noise control accuracy and quality is actually nothing like I have ever experience. I am honestly very impressed with these."
2023-03-28,The transparency mode is incredible! It's completely natural feeling now!
2024-03-27,"How come you didn't cover the microphone, I heard it is amazing with mic noise cancellation"
2024-10-28,What a great review. Love MKBHD
2023-03-28,"They are amazing headphones. I use the Bose QC35ii normally and these are basically just as good.. I didn’t get an engraving cause my pads had come off on the nose and I needed new headphones like right away. 

And that’s the issues with Bose overears.. that’s the fourth time I’ve had to replace the earcups. But.. I got so used to wearing them to bed for the noise cancelling that I constantly repair them. 

Standout feature on the AirPods Pro 2 for me is pretty amazing actually.. I’m 90% deaf in my right ear. With transparency mode on the buds I can hear again. It’s kinda amazing for something that costs $250. 

I looked and Anker makes an OC hearing aide.. $1,500."
2024-03-27,8:23 as a bass head this is amazing
2024-03-27,just upgraded from gen 1s and it was the best thing i ever did
2024-03-27,All good info but yet no discussion about phone call quality. Would love to get some insight as to whether or not these create a better phone conversation.
2024-03-27,They really do have a longer battery life. I wear one in my ear at a time and put them in at 6:30 and it was on 10 percent at 1:30.
2024-03-27,"Lol they make earplugs that do reduce sound without killing the sounds signature. Without any electronics, it's not that crazy mkhd"
2024-09-28,"Also, Apple Stores have an AirPods Pro testing mechanism that tells them when your AirPods should be replaced. I got a whistling/squeal/crackling in one side, took it in, they put it into the magic box, failed the test, and they gave me new ones. No problem since. Big fan of the Apple Store. They really take care of customers."
2024-03-27,Coming from very old airpods with only one these air pod pros 2 are so great the trancparacy mode comes in handy at school so much same with noise cancellation in the halls i can’t hear a thing
2024-11-27,Crazy how like 80-90% people listen to music on YouTube and don’t get to hear their full potential
2024-03-27,I JUST TRIED THE VOLUME
2024-06-30,"I’ve got the gen1 APpro.  At this point, wondering if I should wait for the gen3 now"
2024-08-29,Came here to make myself happy for a 200$ purchase was a great idea
2024-05-31,Love your explanation young man
2024-05-31,I have to help customers get propane. Machine is loud. It reduces the volume but if the customer says anything. I can still hear them pretty good. Wild.
2023-03-28,"Thanks for another nice review. However, I am missing a background noise test. My experience is that the AirPods Pro pick up a lot of background noise and wind, to the point that the the person on the other end is finding it difficult to hear what I am saying and complaining about it. So if I am doing dishes or taking things out of a dishwasher while I am speaking, or walking outside with typical city backcountry noises – these mics pick that up almost better than my own voice and it becomes very annoying for the person I am talking to, to the point I typically have to switch to the built in iPhone mic instead and put the AirPods away."
4  ago,"You're right, I use mine to cancel out loud noises around me."
2024-03-27,In the 20 years I’ve been using Apple products this is the first time I’ve had EarPods that don’t fall out of my ears.  The new XS tips make the difference.
2024-03-27,I'm surprised you didn't mention the microphone quality and call quality
2023-03-28,"Lost my first gens a few weeks ago when I was out of town. I just purchased the 2nd gens and I really love the upgrades. I just wish I could disable my first gens so no one could use them. I see their location, but this was my excuse to by the new ones."
2024-09-28,The small tips make this the first airpods that have ever fit in my ears.
2024-05-01,great video... love your logical analysis of these things!
2024-03-27,"In response to Marques' loud concert scenario, I don't think headphone/earbud noise cancelling provides actual hearing protection. Yes, it reduces noise, but the sound waves are still present. Real hearing protection actually blocks sound waves, instead of reducing/muting them with a reversed signal. Buy real hearing protection if you want to protect your hearing, don't rely on AirPods Pro 2."
2024-05-31,"The adaptive transparency does not work like the video says here around 6:56 , its more like of a adjusting anc if theres a harsh sound and theres a human speaking to you, instead of just cutting off the harsh sound it actually is adjusting like adding more anc so basically it means that the person speaking to you actually gets quieter too, its like low medium high anc control like how much anc you want"
2024-03-27,Halfway through this video and i ordered these things. Im about done with listening to any nonsense when im outdoors
2024-03-27,they are already one whole year old but they are still the best earbuds apple has made in my opinion
2024-03-27,"What I would like to see them do is allow u to be able to find individual buds with gps if u lost it , as of right now gps will only lead u to to the case where ever it is , I sometimes lose the buds because of the job I do."
2024-03-27,"So with adaptive transparency, can you still tell the distance where the sound is coming from?"
2024-03-27,"For some reason, the old ones give me ear infections, when I was playing mobile call of duty on my iPhone."
2024-03-27,Whoa what is that thing you’re filtering light with at 3:10 ? That’s petty dope
2024-03-27,BROOO.. what was that NIGHTMARE FUEL of that DEMON YOU SUMMONED with that paper you put over the pod case?!?!?
2024-03-27,Just ordered a pair since I just switched to an iPhone for the first time interested to see how they do compared to the galaxy bud2 pros
2024-03-27,Love the mismatch feature
2024-12-27,"You should review the reps, they seem to be identical with no flaws."
2025-02-25,"Yep fair enough, I’ll buy them."
2024-06-30,Do these fit like regular airpods or do they rely on the tips to hold them in your ear?
2024-06-30,Excellent review! I'm sold.
2024-03-27,Bro I literally can’t hear anything with noise cancellation this is by far the best noise cancellation I’ve ever had before
2024-03-27,The sound adjustment ?! I never knew
2023-03-28,"Is anyone else having range issues with these?? I can usually get full range with the 1st gen but with these it’s a huge range difference. It cuts out, even at close enough range."
2024-03-27,Great review Marques.
2024-03-27,How about the comfort of these? Are they any better than the previous generation?
2024-03-27,Why do they sell 2nd gen AirPods when they are only 40 bucks cheaper?
2024-03-27,Just purchased mine got em on sale on Amazon
2024-12-27,I’m just here to hear you say ambulance in my new airpod pro 2’s
2024-08-29,Please consider reviewing the Cambridge Audio M100  as they beat hands down in practically all categories especially sound quality than any other makes even some of those twice the price.
2023-03-28,I had a botched piercing I’m my inner right ear and that made the previous model fall out. This middle seems to stay in better for my ears. They also seem to be more comfortable.
2024-08-29,I lost one of my Samsung buds so I picked up these. I was like DAMN the noise cancellation had me on grind mode
2024-03-27,I just got my AP2 and why am I surprised that I can still hear things in noise cancellation mode? I thought I shouldn't be able to hear a thing. Quality is good not mind-blowing as other people make it seem imo. But seriously the noise cancelling was why i bought it and it is surprising that I can hear sounds still.
2024-03-27,"i lovee taking airpods to music concerts, gotta save my ears man"
2024-03-27,I still have a problem with them falling out. I also can’t figure out how to consistently adjust the volume level by swiping the stalk.
2023-03-28,"And also yeah, it in on the AirPod ones Pro or the sound all the way down in Philly and back up to normality so this is a feature from the AirPod pros to. It’s probably just a feature that was found out after the pros to that came out."
2024-08-29,Also came here to justify my purchase all the way in South Africa 🇿🇦 thank you Marques.
2024-08-29,Finally watching this video with my AirPods Pro 2 a year later cool
2024-03-27,"Sure, these things are really good at concerts... But I won't wear mine to any and just use hearing protection designed for it... Not only are they DESIGNED to protect hearing at concerts, also they're 29 euro's as opposed to 299 euros...
But yeah, I got these last week and they're amazing"
2024-03-27,The standard Apple earbuds with a wire alone sounds already pretty good and are basically great allrounders imho..
2024-03-27,Great headphones I’ve tried dupes n nothing can compare AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!
2024-03-27,"It's why I got the jlab sport anc then the liberty 4 anc, for concerts."
2023-03-28,Is it just me that noticed original pros doing the noise reduction on transparency mode? Definitely lowered external noise when it got too loud
2024-03-27,"You must make Apple a ton of money, because this review is what made me buy the new AirPods"
2023-03-28,"$165 open box on amazon, I'm pretty happy with them."
2024-07-30,When’s AirPods Pro Gen3 coming out?
2024-03-27,Candid review. Spot on!
2024-03-27,Will MKBHD review the close Dubai version of the Airpods pro 2?
2024-03-27,"So much features added to the AirPods, that’s a fantastic 2nd gen. Sadly Ultra 2 is nothing near like the amount of features added to the APP2, still got the number 2 on it."
2024-06-30,I should have worn my air pods in transparency mode when I was at the show SIX. It was terrific but 80 minutes straight of extremely load music was tough on the hearing.
2024-03-27,"8:06 as a user myself, I can recommend it for people with over sensory load (or Autism)"
2024-09-28,I love my pair Marques as always great video.
2024-06-30,3:26 my first generation also had wireless charging through the watch charger
2024-03-27,You can enable the transparency mode to fully be like reference monitors as if you where speaking into a mic on accessibility . Like turn up the microfone volume.. It’s crazy.
2024-05-31,"So noise cancelling is suitable for hearing protection? I always wondered if that was the case. The thing that kept me wondering is that in order to cancel the sound, it plays a mirror 'anti-sound' to compensate. So two high volume sounds cancelling each other out making it seem as if there is no sound; yet I'm still wondering about the high volume in the ear canal? I would love to know though as it would be great to know if I could safely use them als hearing protection ie. for using an angle grinder or other loud tools."
2024-03-27,ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS ️
2024-09-28,Picked these up today after my Jaybird Vista 2’s went out on me after almost 5 years. Hole lee shit these sound good. I’m so happy with my purchase and waited to get the 2nd gen’s.
2024-06-30,This gen sounds pretty cool
2024-03-27,Are these good for working out meaning will they fill out during intense activity?
2024-03-27,I was already very impressed with the first AirPods Pro. I pre-ordered the AirPods 2 the moment they were available. Loved using them on both of my trips to Japan.
2024-03-27,I just got them love it
2024-10-28,Really helpful and excellent presentation. Thank you.
2024-03-27,How big is a difference between AirPods Pro 1 and AirPods Pro 2? I’m trying to convince myself to upgrade my older version haha
2024-03-27,I just got them I love them there amazing  defiantly an upgrade from the 1st gen and I do thjnk the new case is the biggest update because of the tracking the loop and the wireless charging and the sound it makes to find the case and the buds
2024-08-29,"I bought it yesterday, and it's really good!"
2024-08-29,"A bit to much bass, seems Dr Dre was involved, he said sometjing like ”give us a smile eq but forget about the highs, so a slope eq. ” I have used the older version to check mixes due to the flat profile, unfortunately this version is simply not good enough. It would be great if Apple could provide a 32 band eq at system level. For amateurs there could be preprogrammed eq settings or fewer bands. I use the airpods on stage all the time when forgetting earplugs, seems there is an even better reason to do so. :)"
2024-03-27,So when you talk about the concert and being able to hear the music at a live reduced volume... then it's like normal earplugs right?  Or shall I say Airplugs.
2024-03-27,Wish he reviewed them on a call not only when listening to music
2024-03-27,So I ordered the air pods 3 then 2 days later these were $40 more but when I got the 3 they were the version that is not MagSafe compatible….unreal man and I checked because I use MagSafe so it was a blessing in disguise because now I’m getting the 2 pros MagSafe for only like $45 more. AirPods are a necessity for me because I use them at work all day.
2024-03-27,Im thinking of saving for them!
2024-03-27,I bought them. But I haven’t received it yet so I’m watching all these videos while I wait for it to arrive
2024-03-27,"dont forget an underrated feature = USB-C  .. no more dongles. I'm coming back to apple with these Airpods Pro 2 and the Iphone15. they sorted out my 2 gripes which were battery duration and a standard charger. So, welcome back apple after more than 10 years on Android."
2024-08-29,I just got mine luckily for the same price kinda to the AirPod  3rd gen will test out both tho this upcoming week
2024-03-27,I just got these earbuds and they gave me a horrible headache. The sound cancelling doesn't work with high pitched loud noises. (Air gun and grinder) It just copies the noise but makes it even more shrill and uncomfortable. I never had that problem with the first gens.
2024-03-27,Did the concert thing last night works great
2023-03-28,I wonder how the sound quality is on Android with these?
2024-06-30,This is really helpful. Thank you.
2024-07-30,"I know I'm a little late but I just wanted to say that on new years, all the fireworks going off would be unbearable without the Pro 2s the before and after I did with adaptive transparency mode was insane, it was still very loud but not as much compared to without them in my ears."
2023-03-28,As an AirPods person this is 100.69% accurate
2024-03-27,"Thanks to hybrid working, most of us need to attend calls from office, where there are other conversations going on, would be interesting to see if these ear buds can filter out those sounds as well. Probably a good test case for future reviews ️"
2024-03-27,"My biggest annoyance is these WONT stay in my ears without having to repeatedly shove them back in, 1st gen with same ear tips don't have the issue. Also when I have to push them back in with noise cancellation on, noise cancellation stops working intermittently."
2024-05-31,I'm watching this video with the airpod pros 2 Gen and there amazing
2024-03-27,Should I get this or AirPods 3?
2024-03-27,I have switched from Samsung phone to iPhone 14 pro max after 10 long years. Is there an Apple app you need to download for these headphones to bring out the best experience like the Samsung earbuds does?
2024-03-27,"On my third pair of Pro 2s now. Lost the first pair. Embarrassed to say how lol. Second pair was stolen minus the left airpod. 
Yes.... I'm Airpods people
I'm a hotel pool operator. I work around 6 pumps all through the day. Another 2 on opposite side of hotel. 
I can say, noise cancellation is beast! I only hear a faint hum of the pumps when listening to my playlists through the day"
2024-03-27,Do they still suffer from sibilance? I had the original Airpods Pro and sold them after a couple of months because they just sounded bad. I'm reluctant to take the risk on these new ones.
2024-11-27,Why the airpods pro 2 don’t show the battery  porcentaje “of the case”  like airpods pro 1 do
2024-03-27,I just got a pair of AirPods Pro 2nd Gen I originally got the 3rd gen AirPods and wish i had just got the AirPods Pro 2nd gen but now i have two pairs of AirPods
2024-03-27,Amazing review!!! please cold you tell me what the green thing is at 3:15 ? Thanks!
2024-03-27,"Hi Marques, Love your new studio. How you were able to bounce the sounds so you almost get no background noise and offcourse your RED cams and lenses.
I have a question. I’m from The Netherlands. And if I go here on the official Apple website. They say these new AirPods Pro 2.0 are supported from the iPhone 8 series. When I go to the American Apple site they say the AirPods Pro 2.0 are supported from the 6 series iPhones. Isn’t that weird?"
2024-03-27,"I think I did this one backwards. I just blindly ordered them because my old air pods were dying. They arrived today so now I'm trying to see what features they actually have. 

Sounds like I made an ok choice though."
2023-03-28,Just bought them love them
2024-03-27,Love the Commitment
2024-03-27,Marques is the goat. Hands down and it’s not even close.
2024-03-27,i just ordered this…hope its good
6  ago,"Just picked a pair up for $200 flat , replacing my OG pair of AirPod pros from 2019. Can’t wait …"
2024-03-27,"I was literally shocked at the noise cancellation for me. Sorry to be cheesy, but it’s actually changing my life lol"
2023-03-28,thank you so much for your videos!
2024-03-27,Is the audio quality better than AirPods Pro first gen ?
2024-03-27,When is apple going to add colour. That’s all I’m asking. I want black or orange.
2024-03-27,Thank you.  Well done.
2024-10-28,Thanks for the video. Very informative.
2024-03-27,"No microphone on them? No word. As a mobile producer, I use apple wired earbuds to lay down scratch vocals while fleshing out ideas. Was interested in these for that purpose. Now I’m sad."
2024-03-27,Are they good to use for gaming aswell?
2025-03-06,As a band member I use them with transparency mode on at practise or at concerts and without them I would be deaf rn
2024-09-28,going from a 30 dollar pair of skull candies. much wow. love mine. especially the noise cancelling.
2024-03-27,I need them to make a ear tip size in-between medium and small
2024-03-27,I will be getting these now my gen 1 airpod pro's are bugging
2023-03-28,Will they protect your hearing from really loud sounds?  Like at a shooting range?  (Asking for a friend)
2024-03-27,"What about wear comfort? Also, nc is not as good as Bose. Should update this video to see what's new with latest firmware"
2024-03-27,Just saw this video with the airpods
2024-03-27,Technology should come with an MKBHD approved sticker. Any time I consider buying something I look up a review by MKBHD first.
2024-03-27,Accidentally washed mine and now i don't know what to do or how  much damage has been done
2024-09-28,They are so good they haven't been updated in a long time.
2024-08-29,"A natural presenter with great info. When you see 4.3K thumbs up to a comment, you know it's gonna be a top-quality video."
2024-03-27,I work in schools. And this has to be true for anyone in public. Transparency mode terrifies me that I won’t be able to hear gunshots.
2024-03-27,Excellent review. Thanx.
2024-07-30,"I'm thinking about getting AirPods Pro 2, however I'm wondering two things:
1. Won't the 3's come out in 2-3 months? I don't mind waiting.
2. Can you enable/disable the noise cancelling? If so, how? Because I will only be using them connected to my Macbook, and I don't have an iPhone (yep), so I can't use a designated iOS app/setting for that."
2024-03-27,"Yes these things are great, just got them, the case battery just isn’t the best though"
2024-03-27,Great review!! Thank you
2024-03-27,I really appreciate the review
2024-05-31,adaptive transparency mode is its own mode now.
2024-03-27,which iPhone were you holding in this video. I like the looks
2024-03-27,"How did they perform for you in terms of remaining connected to your smart TV if the TV is anything but an Apple? Why does no reviewer ever mention this? If you change channel, pause, FFW, rewind, or anything that momentarily interrupts the sound output of the TV, when you resume, no sound from the Pro 2s. Didn't happen with previous Air Pod versions, doesn't happen with my Sonys. Google it. Happens with Samsung, LG and other smart TVs. Known problem since release and all firmware updates. This problem is never mentioned in YT reviews?"
2024-03-27,"Hi Marques, I appreciate your efforts this is an amazing content and AirPods people's is a great word!

This device made my life better for real, I'am using it as Hearing Aid so I can hear even a normal conversations!

I see that Apple take hearing loss seriously while developing this amazing level of ""Transparency Mode"" especially the ""Conversation boost"" feature.

With 249$ and just adding the data from your audiogram you can have almost your hearing back! Where the average hearing aid price falls between $1,000 to $5,000. (More than 90% of its users in my country are strangling from dailly battery cost, the daily cost of two hearing aids is $1 to $7 per day!).

I hope you can add those informations on the next review so people who cannot afford even the old hearing aids that useses standard disposable batteries and also works without any kind of connections like bluetooth! Can have an alternative. Which I personally see it a better solution even on the social level! Thank you :)

* I highly recommend @Doctor Cliff, AuD for more."
2024-03-27,Great informative review.
2024-03-27,"It’s me, I’m AirPods people haha. Just got a pair of these yesterday and I’m blown away by them!"
2024-12-27,I got them for Black Friday
2024-03-27,Just got these at Best Buy
2024-06-30,"thats the thing when I use the transparency mode, I get easily startled whenever some random harsh sound happens. I want to upgrade to these badly since I had my Airpods Pro 1st gen since 2019 but at the same time I feel like next gen Airpods could be announce and I could hold off the gen 2 for gen 3."
2025-01-26,Really great overview!!!
2024-05-31,"I swear, Marques has the smoothest merch plugs! lol"
2024-11-27,Skeptic but no more.  Best sound paired with Spatial Audio.  Noise cancellation is the best I’ve experienced in a while. I’m a big Bose fan and these are better to my ears.
2024-03-27,"Can you do sound tests on ear protection products? There are a lot of gun companies selling noise cancelling products with both foam and silicon. People claim that they are superior to AirPods. I can’t imagine these companies are putting in equal funding for development. Thanks.

I personally want to use foam tips for shooting with my AirPods."
2024-03-27,"I live in the UK where it rains every other day, these look great but impractical without a decent waterproof rating, thanks apple"
2024-03-27,Superb review!
2024-03-27,"I just bought it but I don’t see a difference between transparency mode and noise cancelling mode. In fact, even the nose cancelling mode does not work well either :/"
2023-03-28,I just got them today and I am trying to learn how I find them like this 2:46
2023-03-28,Got these. Thanks.
2023-03-28,I have been watching reviews on these for months. There is one thing stopping me. Is there a noticeable difference between these and the Huawei freebuds pro 1? Thanks
2024-03-27,Does it hurt your ears and can you sleep comfortably when you sleep in lateral position wearing these airpods pro 2?
2024-03-27,Wow! Apple added a compressor in the AirPods i love it!
2024-11-27,So the adaptive transparency is essentially a compressor? But also a reducer?
2024-03-27,"Got these for Christmas and they are amazing. I’ve never had AirPods before because I figured they would not fit and I heard people say they are too quiet. And tbh, I’m pretty positive the regular AirPods would not fit me but these ones do very well. Can’t wait to start bringing them to the gym and I love all these features I keep finding."
2024-10-28,Loved this video. Thank you!
2024-03-27,"When i sit below ceiling fan it cant block the wind sound.
Need improvement there."
2024-12-27,Just got these today $170 Black Friday deals
2023-03-28,"7:02 isn't it an Idea in honk and ambulance siren to be that loud and harsh, so you pay attention to it?"
2024-09-28,Thanks for these videos
2024-03-27,Transparency mode is going to help. I got shot 8 times November of 2021 and I didn’t notice the guy in the bushes waiting for me because I had the AirPods in.
2024-11-27,Now they must make it NOT disrespectful to wear earpods when talking to someone
2024-03-27,Please ignore MKBHD and do not wear AirPods Pros to a gig. They do not and will not protect your hearing.
2024-11-27,Why the airpods pro 2 show 3 headphones  when they are connected to bluetooth? The airpods pro 1 show 2 (what’s it normal…. also the airpods pro 1 show them on the screen including the case battery porcentaje) and the airpods pro 2 don’t
2024-07-30,With that adaptive noise reduction ability how effective are these for ear protection while shooting a firearm?
2024-03-27,"@marquees, a lot of peeps bought the airpods with engrave but the engrave is not showing in the airpods notification"
2024-03-27,I got my secondhand airpods pro 2nd gen for only $120 with AppleCare+ until June 2025
2024-05-31,"On a serious note, I want you to test microphone. I have had microphone issues while travelling outside (everyone complained that they barely hear me). Had this issue after even replacing the headset twice! Can you test?"
2024-03-27,"Tbh the highlight is not the sound quality, it’s the features"
2024-03-27,"Hey Marques, didn't find any reference to call quality or the mic quality?"
2024-03-27,How does it sound when you talk with the AirPods in your ear? Some earbuds that I tried that has the tips in the ear canal makes it muffled like you are covering your ears so it’s better to remove them every time you talk or sing.
2024-08-29,"got one in transition of getting an iphone, tranparency mode is night and day to pixel buds pro"
2024-03-27,I thought I was the only person who used these to save my hearing during loud events and concerts!
2024-07-30,Prime day and my employe discount came in clutch today
2024-03-27,PERSONALISED SPACIAL AUDIO is very accurate with AIRPODS MAX  for me. BUT with the AirPods 3rd gen it is changing nothing .
2024-03-27,at this point idk if were gonna get the gen 3 apple airpods pro. i think i might just go ahead and get the gen 2 pros. thoughts? should i wait?
2024-09-28,Just purchased a certified refurbished version and came here to rewatch this review
2024-03-27,This upgrade is what I love the most also however I still need to test it out at the range I assumed my first air pod pros would be fine at the gun range and the first shot blew them apart as far as the speakers working after the sound of the Glock. Now the setting was on an open ranch in the mountains of Utah however the sound from the gun just ruined the air pod pros. I thought it could handle it lol my bad
2024-08-29,Trust me they r mind blowing. Even with my iPhone 8
2023-03-28,Curious if it would work for lowering gun shots if you were at the gun range.
2024-03-27,Wish mine would cancel out next door's dog barking! Even in noise cancellation mode I can hear it.
2024-03-27,First time watching this man and he’s already capping in the first ten seconds
2024-03-27,I’m buying this for me this weekend
2024-07-30,Another great video but what on earth was that pronunciation of 'ambulance' about?
2023-03-28,How long it takes to be fully charged using 20w apple adapter?
6  ago,still a great vid love these
2024-03-27,Love this review
2024-09-28,So helpful -- thank you!
2024-03-27,"So, addressing 8:11 could you use Airpods Pro 2 on a “jamming with a band“ scenario? Where the drums, guitar amps, and PA system is so loud in a small space… I usually use earplugs but it just muffles the sound… 

would Airpods Pro 2 work better to protect my ears without the “muffleness“?"
2024-06-30,Awesome review
2024-03-27,Nice review thank you
2023-03-28,"8:18 It’s funny you mention the “wearing Airpods in transparency mode mid-concert” thing, as I’ve done this multiple times with my Gen 1s. I was always very impressed with the results, and would consistently come out of concerts with my hearing intact where as my friends would complain about their ears still ringing. Very excited to try this out with my Gen 2s!"
2024-03-27,Does the spatial audio still work on spotify?
2024-03-27,"But here’s the thing, as good as every new version of Apple AirPods come out, they still always break! Something goes wrong with them or the case. For me it has never been worth it to spend hundreds of dollars on this if I know they are going to break! Let me hear from other people about this, because I can’t believe I’m the only one"
2024-03-27,"I’m looking to buy these or the AirPods Max, I bought today my very first iPhone, a 15 ProMax"
2024-03-27,"Great video, does the case work with gen 1 pros?"
2024-03-27,Please review every upcoming dell XPS laptop please.
2024-05-31,I love my AirPods. The best sounding music ever. The best $299 I have ever spent!

2024-08-29,"Apple want you to buy in to their ""ecosystem"" by purchasing multiple Apple devices, yet do not include multipoint Bluetooth to connect to multiple devices simultaneously with their $250 earbuds. Technology that has been around for years and included with other $50 earbuds."
2024-03-27,One word - INSANE
2024-03-27,Mine arrived literally an hour ago and the noise canceling is insane. My 2018 Airpods 2nd gen are garbage in comparison!
2024-09-28,"Can anyone have answer for this Q

i want to buy the AirPods Pro 2023 with USB-C

Does there are difference between 2023 and Sept 2024 edition ?

The new features will be comes in software update ??"
2023-03-28,Is anyone having a problem with their AirPods where it won’t update to the right firmware?
2024-03-27,"I’d really like them to ad a mic on the case so I can talk into it for phone calls, or make it possible to use the iPhone mic to talk into it, while receiving the phone call sound on the AirPods. Could someone maybe ask them to do that? Or just something to make it possible to talk on the airpods without having to scream. or is it just me?"
2023-03-28,Listening this on air pods pods 2nd generation
2024-05-31,I still can’t do the sound control like turning the volume down and up
2024-03-27,"I watched this and went and bought my own pair, i detail cars so they help but when I use an air blower my right AirPod has a lot of static noise is there any reason for that?"
2024-03-27,I got 1st gen Pros near the end of their cycle and they used to attempt to mask loud noises (maybe a prototype feature? idk i havent found anything on it) I would slam a door shut and the airpod would go into full noise cancellation and then slowly adjust back into transparency mode kinda weird
2024-05-31,Strange how little tech reviewers speak of the sound quality.
2024-03-27,Mkbhd you have to review soundcore q45s
2024-03-27,"In order for the 85db reduction to work, the airpods would need to have a seal to your ears similar to an actual earplug. But they don't have such a seal."
2024-03-27,You became an amazing tools for most of Co.s
2024-03-27,"Being an audiotrician, please be careful with using any noise reduction headphones. The noise reduction, unless physical, can still be damaging to your ears. I am not exactly sure how these AirPods work, but if a noise reduction happens with an override of additional sound isolation,  with for example different combinations and frequencies of white/grey/ sound, then the noise reduction is done with sound. And as such, it won't protect your physical ear from damage in a loud environment. In addition, it creates additional sound strain on your ear. Please consult experts and get medical advice  We see uptake in hearing damage in the general population."
2023-03-28,Can these connect to 2 devices at once…and change between them automatically (based on which device I use)
2024-11-27,Great review. Thanks !
2024-03-27,Do u have mic issues with call while in car or outside ? I replaced my pods now but still the problem persists
2024-03-27,Am I the only one who is  woundering if the transparency mode works when your shooting guns
2024-03-27,This made me realize that I often do keep earbuds in for over 6 hours at a time...
2024-03-27,"I never found mine. Its still showing the same last location. I literally went back at that place within 15 minutes of loosing them. This place is a car mechanic on the side of  a busy highway. Btw i was never able to recover mine. Also lost jabra 65t elite active, and jabra 75 pro And lastly the airpods pro 2nd wasnt able to recover any one of those.. today i grabbed a new pair l after about 1 month of loosing my last pair."
2024-05-31,watching this may 6th 2024 and there's an apple event tomorrow at 7am but i do pln on buying these
2024-05-01,are these good for Netflix movies at home ? bcoz my max are showing technical issues..can pro 2 replace max ?
2024-05-01,He had so many names for them. Air buds. Ear pod pros lol.  so many products he reviews I don’t blame him. Love it
2024-03-27,Charging your respods with Apple Watch charger is the least Apple thing I’ve seen.
2024-03-27,late to the party but man do i love them
2024-03-27,"Man this is pretty insane. I had the 1st gen pros and loved them. I actually used to wear them at the drag strip with straight pipe hellcats everywhere and believe me they will make your ears bleed. The gen 1’s made them tolerable, and if these are better than those then holy cow!"
2023-03-28,"I have got AirPods Pro 2 and can compare them with custom silicon earplugs for noice cancelling. Also compare them by music with 200$ wired Meze 99 Neo and  with 200$ wired earbuds Master&Dynamics ME05.

As for noice cancelling without a music Pro 2 blocks sufficient amount of noice but less than custom silicon earplugs. As for music the most detailed - ME05, the best bass - Meze 99, the biggest space - Pro 2, they sounds like semi-open headphones. Overall for music the best is Meze 99, as they give a little more natural sound and better bass. Not very far from them - Pro 2. It is surprising that this little bugs can be even close to such big wired guys as Meze, also Pro 2 occasionally at some compositions may take the 1st place as give the biggest space. 

For watching movies and videos the best are Pro 2, it seems that the sound goes from a screen. Pro 2 gives a lot of comfort and always at hand. Good noice cancelling while watching movies, listen music. Transparency mode is a plus. They seamlessly connect to different Apple devices and give the sound from that device you use in the moment. Actually very-very like them, a very comfortable experience."
2024-06-30,Good ‘ol Ambu-Lance
2024-12-27,"Something to add onto the video: The AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C case actually allow lossless. That is, if paired with an Apple Vision Pro, which sounds like a desperate attempt to sell the Apple Vision Pro."
2024-08-29,Anyone know if the mic is better? I have always had problems on phone calls with people saying it sounds like I’m in a tunnel
2024-10-28,Great review. Thanks.
2025-01-26,"Any thoughts on mic quality for zoom, teams, phone calls etc? Thanks"

2024-03-27,Best airpod
2024-08-29,"Just got my pair, they’re great but I ALWAYS accidentally activate the touch  controls when taking them out, adjusting them, putting them, anyone have suggestions to fix this?"
2025-01-26,Just came here to confirm my purchase
2024-03-27,"I bought the AirPods Pro 2nd gen about 2 months ago. These are the best earbuds for iPhone users. Period. The Active Noise Cancellation is so useful when you're outdoors or even when you're trying to work and don't want to listen to the outside world. It just creates an awesome seal of silence in your ear and it feels discomforting to a first time user but you eventually get used to it. I never use these airpods in transparency mode because the ANC is too damn good. And boy, the connectivity between my mac, iPhone, watch... it's seamless."
2024-03-27,I am in the middle of Do i really need it because this will just die in few years say 3-4 years. You dont have any option to replace battery or cheaper replacement offer.
2024-10-28,"You should be the key speaker for Apple events… Tim Cook has no personality whatsoever, he’s dead in the water before he opens his mouth.

2024-03-27,"After ordering Temu's $6 ""Lenovo"" ear buds, I had a laugh, and ordered the AirPaos Pro 2, LOL!
I've always been on the fence about buying any kind of high dollar ear pods, but I think these will suit me, for what I need, especially the transparency mode, because I attend a church on Fridays, that's loud, REALLY LOUD!!!
I think this will be exactly what I need.
I can't wait for the pastor to ask me why I'm wearing ear buds... LOL!"
2024-03-27,"Hi, can the latest Airpod Pro 2 still be used as a hearing aid for mild/medium hearing loss people? If yes, it what ways has it been improved compared to the previous version? Thanks."
2023-03-28,I upgraded from the 1st gen and the 2nd gen blew me away
2024-03-27,"When I first opened my AirPod Pro 2, I had  “not your AirPods Pro ” pop up on my phone 
Does it mean it’s fake?"
2024-11-27,Didn’t mention the hearing aid component.
2024-03-27,My mom bought this for her work and I tried them on my android. I love this design and very comfortable. I'm thinking to buy this next. And no! I will never EVER buy iPhone products.
2024-09-28,I had the pro 1 and the ANC on the pro 2 are a crap ton better
2024-03-27,Should I upgrade from AirPods Pro gen.1?
9  ago,"What configuration takes the best sound quality out of it? I feel like spacial audio mode spreads sound in a way it takes off a little bit of sharpness from it. I don’t know if I’m used to stereo music, but I feel better to listen to it with spacial audio off."

2024-03-27,Started using the AirPods Pro 2 and my ear aches. Tried multiple buds but after 15-20mins of runtime it aches. Any work around?
2024-03-27,Is it a good idea to use these as hearing aids?
2024-03-27,"this product might be good, but i dont understand how us, students need such an expensive pair of earphones just for daily spotify uses, most of the people cant even tell the difference between good quality and average quality, it doesnt even matter to most of the people (mainly friends and other students i see at school) yet they purchase such an expensive product. I personally don't have much preference as long as theres noise cancelling, mine costing 25 dollars work just as well."
2024-03-27,Sony linkbuds S with a smaller form and LDAC  would kill this.
2024-03-27,"How come I hear transparacy mode if you take one out, and noice canceling is not working any more?"
2025-01-26,How good is the bass when listening to music? Bought the air pods 4 recently and was the worst purchase I could ever make sense of course they don't make the air pod 2 anymore.
2024-12-27,"This video makes it seem like Adaptive is always on in Transparency mode, but I see them as two separate modes. Does the normal default transparency mode not reduce harmful noises? Do I have to be in Adaptive for that?"
2024-08-29,"If you struggle with which ones to get: AirPods Pro 2 >>> AirPods Max. My only complaint with AirPods Pro 2 is that conversation awareness is terrible, it's triggered when I don't want it to and doesn't activate fast enough when I need it. They really need to amp up that neural engine in the next generation."

2024-03-27,Just got on sale for Black Friday for $139
2024-03-27,The noise cancelling on these is quite ridiculous. My wired in-ear monitors that are custom molded to my ears let in more noise than these do.

2024-03-27,Audio quality listening to music is my priority so not for me. Apple can only use inferior AAT codec - sub par
2024-03-27,Can you or would you workout with these? I’m tempted to get these
2023-03-28,Before I buy anything? I watch? Your. Videos? My. Friend you're amazing you're a knowledge is outstanding. If you give it a bad review or 10 not the like something. I will not buy it like to Apple watch ultra. I ended up going with the Apple watch 8 because of your review.  The watch apple watch eight goes with anything

2024-07-30,"so I watched this hoping you would convince not to spend this much money cause I already have the 1st gen and it turns out you convinced me to buy it. thanks, I guess"
2024-08-29,Its a 24000 ₹ in india which is almost 2.5 times more expensive than most budget Smart “Phones” in India. and they don’t even fit tight in the ears. I have seen so many people complain. They cares so much about the lanyard loop which might not ever be used ever… but the thing that would matter the most… they just literally ignored really?? Its a shame. Its like a sipper which has digital display showing the tempature of the liquid inside best in class insulation … Can self stir… can do a bottle flip but itself.. when you try to drink it the liquid drips down the bottles little corner instead of your mouth  @mkbhd… i have been following for years now and i trust you for my tech advice all my life..

2024-03-27,"Can the noise cancelation and other things, damage your health?"
2024-03-27,"I spent the extra money on them for the tracking.  It gave me notifications to the point of being too much.  Then I just realized they are not in my bag.  NO notification!!
Don't get these for reliable tracking. Gimmick that does not work when you need it to.  Almost felt like Apple was giving me the finger.  
So much money.  :(    :("
2024-03-27,Same bro but I got pro 2s but I still broke ahh hell
2024-03-27,what is that green square you used to show the placement of the magnets?
2025-01-26,Might actually be the best apple product of all time lowkey (or maybe even the best earbuds?)
2024-05-01,I use those with my S24ULTRA
2024-07-30,The noise cancellation immediately makes me feel insanely weird. I don’t use it at all.
2023-03-28,Are you trying to tell me I can jam out to Brittany spears and go to the gun range and not worry about ears ringing??
2024-03-27,Noise canceling for the person wearing but not for the people you’re talking to. Airpods has a problem
2024-03-27,Bose needing a app to adjust them was a dealbreaker
2024-03-27,Not me watching the review video just after actually buying them online

2024-05-01,"Do not use noise cancelling headphones as hearing protection, It may sound quieter but the pressure is still damaging your ears.  Use ear plugs as that is what they are designed for.  It sounds like a logical assumption to make, but it's false and your ears will still be damaged as much as if you used nothing."
2024-03-27,im considering them and the Sony 1000xm4. has anyone used both and can tell me which one i should choose when i mainly go to the gym and runing? i love listening to music most of the day so battery wins in Sony but what about sound and comfort? thank you!

2024-03-27,"Please review
Please again review beat studio buds, they claim it has spatial audio, on beats site as well apple but I got confirmation from apple support that spatial audio is not available . Apple has been misleading customers. İ asked apple to replace the beats studio bud , they told me , the product is correct but ad is wrong . Can not believe apples audacity regarding a 149 USD product . Apple should recall all beats studio buds . İ have written a letter to you regarding this issue about 6 weeks ago. THANK YOU"
2024-10-28,Are these the AirPods Pro 1 or 2?
2024-03-27,If you want to appreciate the bass on these listen to some Barry White.
2024-03-27,ambulance sounds are meant  for emergencies tho we shouldnt just ignore them i mean someone may be dying
2024-09-28,Just get the freebuds pro 2 and you will be blown away
2024-03-27,I would advise against using these earbuds for ear protection. These are not catered for that use. There is little evidence about background sound sound cancelling and hearing protection.
2024-03-27,Do you think this works for gunshots?
2024-07-30,That mkbhd bottle comparison was not smooth
2024-08-29,I just got mine today
2025-02-25,Doresc să cumpăr produsul! Cum sa procedez? Va mulțumesc!
2024-03-27,"Problem with these is that they are only good for a year or two before thae batteries start dying

 I got 2  of the 1st gen pro's my wife's lasted only 13 months 1 month shy away from the 1 year warranty replacement her left buds stopped charging then the other bud died after 3 months and now mines also acting up there is no qestion their good but if your expecting 2 yrs and above use for these you are going to be disappointed ."
2024-03-27,My noise canceling isn’t canceling what sound I do

2024-03-27,"At 8:35, there was a revelation for me how strange these “concerts” (as the millennials and generation Z call them) are. 
The volume of noise is near to lethal and they have to wear ear plugs or use AirPads Pro 2 to reduce the volume. Wouldn’t anybody simply ask the organizers to reduce the volume of the loudspeakers instead of annoying the neighborhood of these “concerts”?"
