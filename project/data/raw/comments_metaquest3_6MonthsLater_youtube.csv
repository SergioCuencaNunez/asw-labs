2024-06-03,"I think about it this way: is there a better standalone vr headset for under $1000 than this? Right now, I’d say no. This is the best in the Market for the price."
2024-06-03,"I used it every single day since buying it and I've owned many headsets, including 2 quest 2s, quest 3 is by farrr the best headset I've ever owned or used"
2024-07-03,"1:16 You can check your phone notifications with the quest 2 if you turn down your phone brightness! Found this out about a year ago and has been super handy! I agree, taking your headset off just to check your phone is a hassle so I hope this helps for all of you who are still running the quest 2 like I am"
2024-06-03,Bonus point is the Quest 3 is great when plugged into a gaming PC or wirelessly paired with a gaming PC for more robust games.
2024-06-03,I absolutely love the quest 3. The upgrade is well worth it. They are constantly updating and making it even better. For a standalone headset it's a must have. I am happy with my purchase and look forward to what's in store for the future.
2024-11-30,I'm saving up for one. I'm legally blind and disabled. I used a PSvr (my only vr experience) once and the crazy thing is I could see better even through the older PSvr. I want that experience with the quest 3. Just 360 video of a sunset must be incredible. I'm going blind. It's a slow burn. I need this upgrade.
2024-06-03,id rather buy this than apples overpriced headset that does less
2024-07-03,"Honestly I found I use my Quest 3 WAAAAAAAYYYYY more than I used the Quest 2. Its just more comfortable to wear. The Quest 2 sticks out the front much more and while it is technically lighter, that front loading makes it feel heavier. A good headstrap (I use the BoboVR M3 pro) and it is even better and I can wear it for hours. Plus the lovely pancake lenses and their huge sweet spot just means getting it clear and comfortable are WAY easier. Its just a vast improvement all around IMO and while I would look at the Quest 2 sometimes and end up going ""Naw, its too much hassle to put on and get adjusted"", with the Quest 3 its like ""Oh yeah this is just easy on and off, time to jump into VR for a half hour or so"". Honestly I have used it basically every single day since I got it and with Asgard's Wrath to getting yet another Quest 3 upgrade, that doesn't look like it will change anytime soon."
2024-06-03,"Well I went right for buying the Quest 3.  Has more powerful processor, Better pancake lenses, Nice color passthrough, and playing my PCVR SIM racing games connected via USB link cable. All in all it has been a great upgrade from my Oculus Rift S.
Only change I did is replace the original head strap with the BoboVR S3 Pro head strap.  Besides better comfort, it provides me a battery which has larger capacity for playing even longer times with the Quest 3.
Hand controllers are only used for selecting menus and work very good. I do not do action VR games which swing them around all over the place. I am always sitting down playing racing games.
Thanks for your video. Take care."
2024-06-03,All I know is the color passthrough is a MANDATORY FEATURE for every VR moving forward.
2024-06-03,"As a quest 2 user, I will wait for the quest 4. It's I pretty good boost but not going to blow me away. I want to be amazed by standalone so I will wait 3 years."
2024-06-03,"You have to keep in mind that the headset has vignetting because of the pancake lenses, basically the rim of your vision appears to darken rather than stay the same brightness like on the Quest 2. It can be jarring for some people, and you’ll probably need to increase the brightness as well, the screen isn’t as bright as the quest 2. 

One of the benefits of the Q3 is that you can get half-body tracking if you install the beta version of virtual desktop. Essentially tracking down to your waste. Also the fov is a better, especially horizontally, and the resolution is higher/crisper."
2024-09-01,This is not a fair review because you make money if we use your links to buy it. Not like you're going to give it 1 out of 10 when there are sales on the line.
2024-11-30,6 months since this video…
2024-06-03,"Can't believe I am saying this, but I still use my Quest 3 every day. Love that thing."
2024-06-03,"Quest 2 user here. I'm waiting to see what Valve does for their next headset. While I do play games, the primary thing I'm doing in VR is world exploration. Between YouTube, Trip2VR, Wander, and Patreon supported 8k 180 3D videos, I've been to as many places as your typical wealthy person."
2025-01-29,"Quest 3 is worth the upgrade. You get a more comfortable headset that hugs your face better, less tiresome on the face. The lens are a major improvement, not having to stare through a sweetspot. The color passthrough is not perfect but with the mixed reality added in it's a major improvement over the 2."
2024-07-03,"there are 2 paths for endgame VR users:
1. Boredom, it sits on a shelf and gets used for an hour once a month
2. VRchat, you spend 12 hours a day as an anime girl in VRchat drinking"
2024-08-02,"Great video! I am a very busy guy so I would not call myself a gamer, no time. BUT! I was told that VR is where the new media is heading. So, a while ago I got a Quest 2. Ouch... I have been addicted to Pro Era Football, Dragon Kung Fu and Vader Immortal, and don't forget YouTube VR. I even had to get a better more vented mask when in the Kung Fu app. Even if you go to Vader Immortal III, practicing with the light saber will work up a sweat. I also found that with my Logitech Pro headphones the experience is so much greater. I guess for me VR is my escape from the world for a little bit, so putting on those headphones isolates me even more. YouTube VR, wow, I can be in Tibet or ride a Swiss train without leaving my house.
Great stuff, keep it coming.

And YouTube VRWow!"
2024-06-03,I do have to disagree with a few points: weight and confort can be fixed with a 3rd party strap (bobovr is top) and second point is regarding watch series and movies… which I do quite frequently and it’s amazing to do.
2024-06-03,I went with the Pico 4 Pro instead of Meta Quest 3 for cheaper and I'm still very happy.
2024-11-30,Whos here 6 months later
2024-06-03,"Personally I came from a RiftS with Occulus/Meta, but I also have a Valve Index - Knuckles Controllers are still the best hands down but the Quest 3 controllers are built like tanks and lightweight, Tracking is much much Better than the RiftS was despite having better placed Camera array. Honestly LCD/Lenses I prefer the Quest 3 the pancake lenses just make that much more a difference, you aren't getting the blacks that the Index has, Its really hard to compare the 2 as the Quest 3 relies on compression versus a native render from the GPU, I wish the Quest 3 had USBtype C with DP support for the USB jack it would honestly make such a difference and a more fair comparable comparison because some games just don't Compress well, although some apps support the AV1 codec which makes a huge difference if you are using NVidia 4000 series. Still the image quality is real nice. 
From the RIftS its a major step up, Index though is a bit more complicated, If you have the extra money to toss around I would say get the Quest 3 just because it has the ability to go anywhere. However I have a major feeling Valve is cooking in the kitchen again and basically we will get a superior standalone from Valve in the next couple years that will be a no compromises headset. Personally I think the speeds of Wifi 7 will be the key to wireless HMDs having a higher bandwidth allowing for less compression artifacting and image degradation while being more stable as well. I can see Virtualization in reverse using ARM chips to run X86/x64 applications at lower settings on the go, and probably Hybrid tracking.
I personally Meta is going nowhere for the forseeable future, even if the company closed shop Valve would buy them in a heartbeat and transition everything to their branding and such."
2024-11-30,"Wow! Thanks for the Quest 3 review. I was planning to get the Meta Quest 2, but with this review about the comfort, displays, graphics and gaming performance, I think I will go for the Meta Quest 3. Thanks Josh!"
2024-10-31,"Controllers are incredibly light and feel good. 
Also passthrough does not look as clear as the videos show you. It looks waves better than the Q2 though, but once you’re in game you won’t notice that much. 
When placing your hands on the facial interface can feel a little off compared to a solid, large hunk of plastic. 
Pancake lenses are a game changer. Wider fov and none of that blur on the edges, making captions and text on the edge clear.
The strap is also an improvement over the previous version. 
IPD adjustment is nice but the wheel can be difficult to turn to the max.
Hand tracking is also an improvement."
2024-11-30,watching this 6 months after this vid dropped...
2024-06-03,"I have not experienced WiFi problems, maybe i have good unit? I use Q3 too, and router is upgraded to recommended Asus due WiFi stability.
Not all routers have good WiFi stability or can output many WiFi for long sessions for wireless use with Virtual Desktop."
2024-06-03,"I actually don't like that the glasses spacer is built in now. It introduces a weakpoint in the construction that's easy to break and if you have it tight up against your face, it doesn't hold the position you set it to very well. I always recommend getting lens inserts anyway.

I think the quest+ subscription is kinda weak. It's just not a good value. Though I generally dislike subscription models anyway.
The casting on the quest used to be much better but meta decided to remove official support for it so now it's really hamstrung.
That aside I agree with the other points in the video."
2024-10-31,I totally disagree with not using the quest to watch 2d content. It's how I watch all sports and Netflix now with multiple screens all over the room
2024-08-02,That review was so positive it could have been sponsored. I'm sold.
2024-11-30,why is this perfectly at the 6 month mark
2024-11-30,Meta's cutting-edge technology is changing the game! Its commitment to innovation and community building is impressive and empowering
2024-06-03,Tried the Quest 2 and ended up returning it and bought the 3 instead. The upgrade was worth it.
2024-12-30,watching this 6 months later...
2024-09-01,I expected a bit more in depth info than “interface can get glitchy” after 6 months.
2025-02-28,I bought my Quest 3 about a week ago… Holy shit it’s straight out of Black Mirror… This is the future guys. I bought a good amount of Meta stock last night LOL
2024-11-30,Found out this Video 6 Months Later after you post this. what a coincidence
2024-10-31,"My experience with VR/AR headsets in general, is that they will be a novelty for the first month or so and then will become like any gaming device, you use it when you are in the mood to, so I personally think that for the price point it is well worth it,"
2024-06-03,"I don't even notice the screen door affect. If there is, it never takes away from the movie quality. Anybody else feel this is an issue for them?"
13  ago,I am buying a headset because I want to go to VRChat. Will definitely try the other games but this is the main objective. I'm obsessed with the idea of living in another world that is completely virtual.
2024-08-02,I like how when he's looking on his apple watch he's on spotify he's listening to daddy I love him
2024-08-02,Just got one for my birthday!!!!! (My first  vr set and my first time ever using vr)
2024-06-03,"VR motion sickness hits me only when framedrops or general low framerates appear, otherwise I am next to immune. Gotta find a store to try this out at before I buy (in Sweden) so thank you for the video."
2024-12-30,haha i’m watching this SEVEN months later. take that
2024-10-31,"I've had my Q3 for over a year and continue to love it. I upgraded from a Rift S so it was a pretty big jump. I mainly use it for racing and flight sims, and it is excellent for both. They have continued to improve the passthrough and virtual desktop resolution. Both are very good now. My one big complaint is that I wish it had a display port input for uncompressed PCVR display. I will say that whatever compression artifacts there are don't bother me. I barely notice them and I don't think it should be a deal-breaker for anyone. I also understand that Meta is trying to push the standalone side of VR gaming, and that is where their real money is made. However, I still think they'd make a lot of PCVR users happy with the addition of a simple port. Maybe in the Q4 or the Q Pro 2?"
2024-07-03,If it was 100$ cheaper it would be number 1
2024-12-30,This got recommended to me 6 months after uploading
2024-10-31,I'm thinking of picking up a refurbished Quest 3 for $379 and then sell my Quest 2.
2024-10-31,Thank you for the thorough review and honest insights on the Meta Quest 3 after six months of use- it's helpful to know how the novelty wears off with time!
2024-11-30,Decided to plunge for Quest 3 ahead of the 3S (which I regard as quest 2.5) version as I owned a quest 2 and I loved the experiences more than the gaming side but wanted that in top vision which nearly happened whilst I wore the quest 2 but not quite so I sold it...Need the vision and the power to move forward now!!
2025-02-28,Very informative!  Thx
2025-01-29,"My main use would be 3d video and when I used to use Gear VR I was shocked by how bad the resolution is of even 4k VR videos, I mean it looked like 480p. It seems the sweet spot will be 8-12k video and there just isn't much of that in existence yet."
2024-10-01,i like the controller ring . it made it easier to put down.so stood it vertical
2024-06-03,It feels like the broader expectation for VR has not been set properly. The quest is a very versatile and portable. gaming console. It games it does almost anything your phone does it keeps you active and all with a novel and immersive interface. It's great for pop in pop out sessions and media consumption.
2024-10-31,"When it's overly positive it's an ad, not a review."
2024-08-02,Great review. Answers all questions I’ve had. Thank you.
2024-11-30,Been looking for another great tech YT channel to binge. Got my sub after this video (and I picked up a MQ3)
2024-11-30,"Never had the Quest 2. However, the Wifi issue you mentioned gave me ptsd nightmares from my occasional experience with the Original Quest."
2024-07-03,"""That plus the weight of it"" Dude it's 10 times more comfortable than the Apple Vision Pro"
2024-09-01,META is horrible about returns if you buy bundles which can’t be returned and DLC content. This is especially bad because sometimes you don’t even get your DLC content. FB and META are terrible companies to deal with. I also see people in groups complain that their headset no longer works because METAclaims they broke some rule so they brick their headsets. And they have no idea how to appeal! Hate this company!
2025-01-29,I am here to know about quest 3 but I will ended buying an uplift desk first.  being looking for one. I guess this video works for everyone….good job
2024-10-01,The lens' are bubbled outward and wearing glasses can scratch them up if not careful. I wonder if there is a way they could have made the lens' bubble inward
2025-03-16,Great and thorough review
2024-11-30,Talking about it exclusively in standalone really undersells the Quest
2024-09-01,"12:08 steam deck had the same issue, its with the internet, you have to disable something in the internet settings i cant recall what it is called though."
2025-01-29,"wtf your "" Ouh"" at 4:50 gave me a solid jumpscare , with headphones it sounds like someone is behind you"
2024-07-03,so we can't replace our pc monitors with this yet? That's what i need
2025-02-28,"""Ive focused on training with weights"" He said. With pasta arms"
2024-11-30,"1st generation ,2nd generation, i can tell you thou, at 2:24 you like like a top generation dork"
2024-06-03,Quest 3 is mainly for gamers and you not even try PCVR  you don't now his potencial
2024-06-03,I want to see what other hardware manufacturers do with the operating system before I get my first VR goggles.
2024-06-03,totally worth it imo. fucking great device
2024-11-30,Nice to see Zack Morris is doing well in 2024
2024-11-30,"Has anyone here been to Carousel of Progress in Disney World? If so, let us recognize we are now the family in the scene in future. We are there."
2024-12-30,If you get virtual desktop it really is a great product
13  ago,"By the time you use it for 15 days, your experience will be worth the money you paid."
2024-12-30,"I do have an apple Vision Pro with which I am delighted.
One of its best features is the ability to replay panoramic photos and immersive photos, that I’ve taken on my iPhone 16, which look stunning.
I want to show these in particular to others so have purchased an Oculus Quest 3 since the AVP is both cumbersome for others to wear and needs setting up for each individual.
However, I’m very disappointed to discover that those photos are too high in resolution to be displayed as panoramics or immersives on the Quest 3.
But the resolution of the panoramic and immersive samples on the Quest are even better than I had hoped.

The idea of reducing the resolution of my photos is a complete anathema."
2024-06-03,Can you please go into more details regarding viewing your PC screen on the headset? This is the biggest use case I see for this- being able to have a multi-monitor setup anywhere in my house with a wireless keyboard and mouse. How glitchy is it?
2024-10-31,"For a monitor replacement, how is it? and what about the Xreal Air 2?"
2024-12-30,I'm hoping I'll be able to pick one up after Christmas : )
2024-06-03,"I don't have a need to upgrade from my quest 2, so I'm waiting impatiently to see a reveal of an index 2 before I plan on it."
2024-11-30,"Ayo, is this Zach Morris from Saved By The Bell?!"
2024-09-01,Great video!  I am finding this 9 months later.  I might pick this up when it goes on sale again.  No replaceable battery and current game application offerings are going to keep me away from a full price purchase
2024-11-30,"Damn, this YouTube is crazy fit"
2024-07-03,I'd rather get this than the Quest pro. This review was very good and I've seen in other reviews they said the same thing about the quest pro and that the Quest 3 is a better buy and better option for the future.
2024-07-03,I'm not that interested in gaming.  How much VR video content is available? I tried a quest 2 and watched a nature documentary with lions on youtube VR that was awesome.  If there was more content like that I would be interested.
2024-08-02,For me the selling point is exclusives the Batman game and the hitman 3
2024-08-02,I LOVE THE QUEST 3  AND INTO THE RADIUS
2024-12-30,When zen studios releases Pinball FX this will be an insta buy. Thanks for the video.
2024-08-02,I've got a 512gb on the way got half life alyx and skyrim vr on sale
2024-10-31,"I bought a 512MB Quest 3 on sale (the price has been jacked up again now) and it's a nice headset. I think tbh that the biggest problem I find with it has nothing to do with VR and the absolutely execrable way it integrates with Facebook and the store too. It's just redirect this way, redirect that, way, we've sent you a code, code didn't work, we've sent you another code, did you forget your PIN, reset your PIN, redirect, ""an unknown error has occurred"". I tried to buy one lousy game for an hour and it didn't work. Next day it worked, but not with freezing on a few screens during purchase so I wasn't sure or not if I had bought the thing. Everything is just swap in and out of the headset, the app, email, rinse, repeat. You would think signing on or buying something would be made as frictionless as possible, but it's the complete opposite. It's ALL friction. Hardware wise it's quite nice but the way they were hyping it I was expecting a better FOV. It works reasonably though and I also have it set up with the Steam app to hook to some Steam games over wifi and that works too."
2024-08-02,i wanna get this for Christmas this year
2024-10-31,"Quest 1 user here! DId I want the quest 2, no not really I heard some not so great things about it so I didn't spend the money to upgrade and my quest was still doing it's job just fine. Now that some of the game companies have begun to no longer support the quest 1 I have to look for other options! This is one I've been thinking about for a long time so it's a maybe for me unless something better comes along in 2025."
2024-06-03,"Keeping my eye on the price. If it goes on a sale, then I'll probably take the plunge. The wifi thing is a little bothersome, but honestly, the pancake lenses and the removal of the sensor rings in the controllers are the things I'm most interested in. Having only a very small area where the image is clear is really, REALLY obnoxious, and I've bashed the controller rings against a wall I didn't know I was so close to. To their credit, they've held up amazingly well, but it'd be nice not to deal with them. All in all, I'm interested, but not $500 interested. 

Also, Walkabout mini-golf. I originally wanted the VR for things like zombie shooters and Blade and Sorcery, but I was absolutely not prepared for how many hours of my life I'd lose to Walkabout. This game doesn't seem to get a ton of a fanfare in the VR world, but I'm hopelessly addicted a year after my initial purchase. It doesn't hurt to have a core group of friends that play either. We do a game or two on Sunday's, and sometimes fill the room almost to it's capacity of 8, and have a ton of fun with it. Seriously, check that game out. It's wonderful."
2024-07-03,I thought that this channel is about using a product for six months and giving information about the long term experience of using it. But that video feels like it's just a channel that reviews and posts videos 6 months later to compete with existing reviewers based on freshness. how many times did you use the quest 3 for the last six months or how many hours in total?
2025-01-29,You sold me on the lying down mode.
2024-11-30,Guys convince me to buy one and convince me not to buy one. (I’ve been wanting to get into vr for a while )
5  ago,Well today I have had enough of Quest2 screen unlocking. In a race this evening I started dead last to run 13th to be taken out by the screen unlocking. The graphics in Iracing are awesome and the speed in which the objects pass by. Q3 time.
2024-08-02,I get lost in pc games enough. I don't need this to risk a mental illness where I don't know what reality is anymore
2024-08-02,"I feel motion sickness.
1. Should I buy this headset?
2. Can I play 360 games on Virtual monitor for 2d view?"
2024-06-03,Thank you so much im getting one for my birthday.
2024-09-01,I suffer motion sickness. Can I use these?
2024-09-01,My quest 2 air link never ever worked and my quest 3 literally did it by accident
2024-06-03,tbh one of my best purchases recently
2024-10-31,Batman Arkham Shadow is single handedly going to make me get one
2024-07-03,"Still using the oculus rift here, and honestly, I don’t feel the need to shell out 500$ when I can spend 200$ and get the quest 2. Just doesn’t feel like a proper leap given the price"
2024-11-30,Thank you!
2024-11-30,"Appreciate the video. Wasn't sure whether I wanted the Quest 3 or The Vive Pro 2. But, leaning Quest. Especially since I can log on to my Steam account. Wouldn't mind hearing more about the battery life though."
2024-10-31,"Great review!  I'm a quest2 user and while the tech is awesome, most of the games available have poor graphics. On the upside, if you have a good gaming PC, it can really enhance your gaming experience."
2024-10-31,You are limiting yourself by limiting yourself.  There are so many interesting and unique game experiences out there.
2024-10-01,"Bought it, used it for a month, it's sat on my desk ever since. 

Kudos to everyone who enjoys these but I think it's not for me :)"
2024-09-01,"I bought Meta Quest 3, but from the first experience the vision was not clear, more like dust and blurring, and I cannot see the phone or computer screen clearly.  I have tried all measurements of eye distance. So far I have not found any solution to the problem. Clarity only in applications and games"
2024-09-01,I read somewhere that streaming apps only stream at 480p…is that still the case? Are they working on fixing that? So weird that a device that would be perfect for streaming has such a shit resolution. I want to buy one of these instead of a giant TV for media consumption.
2024-11-30,The Meta Quest 3 looks promising! Can't wait to see how the new design and improved specs impact the VR experience. Will it finally be the VR headset that truly takes off?
2024-10-31,Brother. Get the kiwi strap. You will regret every second you used it without it.
2025-02-28,"""... has been especially fun at parties...."" Cuts to clip of him playing alone."
2024-10-01,I received the quest 3 today and I ONLY purchased it because I’ve noticed my Quest 2 getting hot and glitching since the updates. I don’t use it enough for that to even happen so it has to be from the update. Also I think it’s wrong to give an option of 128 or 512 gb knowing what most people will do and with a price tag of almost $700 for the larger gb is WILD! The quest 2 had a 256gb option for way less and holds a ton of games.
2024-07-03,The meta return policy is a lot like Steams return policy lol
2024-12-30,I'm watching this 6 months later
2024-10-31,You are like the Doug Demuro of the tech world ...car guys knows what im talking about
2024-08-02,I am only getting the headset to use it for my PC via a link cable. I am getting beat saber (For one pre-loaded on the quest in a event of a black out so im not bored and one on steam) just for casual things like playing Digimon music and having my own custom songs. Because Audio Surf is getting older and older. And some games I own already have built in VR added in later on like No Man Sky. The Meat of the game I be using it for is Half Life Alyx.
2024-10-01,"First of all... HORRIBLE idea to use your VR headset next to your expensive TV. Second... great review... pretty much spot on... MR, hands tracking and glitches have been improving through updates... The main downsides are: battery life (around 1 hour... not good enough).... and comfort... the stock headband is bad. You will probably need to invest another $100 to get a 3rd party replacement."
2024-12-30,"I am watching a six month old video, about a product which was released 6 months prior."
2024-10-01,thankfully I don't get any motion sickness but my sister could not last even half a minute in a VR game. I used to have Oculus Go but ordered Quest 3 last week
2024-12-30,"I don't own a (gaming) pc, but I do have a PS5. So what would be better, the quest or buy the VR for the PS5? Really having a hard time deciding, because I keep reading about the Meta not being able to handle more robust games like Half Life. What's your experience on this?"
2024-06-03,"Can confirm WiFi issue, it's annoying af"
2024-12-30,thank you for this video a found vert informative
2024-11-30,Didn’t know Zack from saved by the bell had his own YouTuber channel
2024-06-03,"It is a device you use at home like a video game console. Thus, there is no purpose to a password."
2024-06-03,Why can I not swap my headset battery im sick of being limited to the battery life of my headset
2024-10-01,I finally just got one. I'm looking forward to the new Batman game and Metro Awakening
2024-10-31,"99% of the time when i use my quest 2 is to play beatsaber, the other 0.5% is pistol while and the other 0.5% is to try out something else once in a few months.
but i use a claw grip on the quest 2 where the rings help support the wrists, i wonder if claw grip is still a thing with quest 3 controllers."
2024-09-01,It's very frustrating that Vader Immortal is still the benchmark for narrative experience on the quest. It needs more software.
2025-02-28,My virtual boy is getting a little old and I’m considering my upgrade options. This quest 3 is in the running. Can I use the quest 3 stand alone or do I need to also buy internet to use it?
2024-11-30,This is honestly really good for the price
2024-06-03,"I ordered mine last night. Great video, I'm pretty excited now"
2024-09-01,8:36 thank me later
2024-08-02,Notice how bro plays the most basic most dry games known to man
2024-08-02,I need to show this to my mom so she lets me buy the quest 3
2024-06-03,"Hellsweeper is crazy good, keeps me coming back. That's said, quest 3 is largely unplayable without upgraded facial interface + bobovr s3 halo strap."
2024-06-03,Hmm I was considering a Quest 3 for primarily watching movies.. sounds like I should maybe consider AR/XR glasses instead?
2024-08-02,What was the game on 9:56 ???
2024-07-03,Are people actually noticing a screen door effect? Because I sure don't.
2025-01-29,Dude is glazing apple so hard
2024-11-30,watching 6 months after nice
2024-09-01,What if you are long sighted. Would the vision be clear ?
2024-12-30,"I watched this video on 6 months later channel, when they used meta quest for 6 month and the video itself were released 6 month ago while having 666 thousands of views..."
2024-11-30,"I'm thinking about getting the quest 3, but I thought you had to use the hand controllers. Did you mention there's hand-tracking as well?"
2024-09-01,Is this the little brother of Zack from saved by the bell. Lol
2024-06-03,The passthrough is not good enough for read screens. This is a bait
2024-12-30,I live  in Australia - it’s fn hot enough here in summer without strapping all this stuff to your head and face
2024-11-30,Caution before buying this there's a lot of complaints of people going back to Meta Quest 2 because of an over heating problem the Quest 2 is more bulky and durable than the Meta Quest 3 some people have complained of the CPU over heating where you can feel it on your head. I might go back to my Meta Quest 2 I love the idea it's awesome how this works but I'm better off using my PlayStation VR2 which doesn't give off this kind of heat which has better screen display than the Meta devices plus I think the over heat cracked my screen display not good. It's better than Apple Vision Pro but Meta needs to have a liquid cooling device or something for this as an accessory fair warning guys as a Quest 3 owner this headset does overheat I do enjoy watching movies on it like Cyberpunk it could just be me seeing the screen door effect too I could be wrong or it could be the way the camera is I still don't see cracks on it but it's still recommended to give this thing a cooler.
2024-10-31,"i had a quest 2 when it launched, i sold it about a year ago but now i want another because of various reasons, i cant decide wether to go for the 3 or 3s.. i do want it to feel like an upgrade and i hear the pancakes are much better. does it actually feel higher resolution even though its marginal? doe sth passthrough look better on the quest 3? any info much appreciated, thanks everyone!"
2024-10-31,"If you need a Quest repaired, working with Meta Support is very painful, bonkers level I've a Q2 paperweight (won't charge), and very hesitant to purchase a Q3. They need to work out the bugs before I consider buying another... and I have a Oculus GO... I was a fan."
2024-10-01,head set is great but the strap sucks hurts my head and the pass through is extremely grainy i can’t even see anything on my phone.
2024-08-02,My mom said I can buy it one day!
2025-03-16,Can I lie in my bed and play civilization with it on my PC?
2024-06-03,"ill get this in few days, after this weekend :) hope its worth it :) ... can always return them if they feel same face heavy and hot to my face as the meta quest 2 felt and was like.."
2024-08-02,There are lots of games on pc that you can play in vr on mod vr if you'd want to get a little bit involved.
2024-06-03,I've been playing some of the same games I was already playing with VR mods to play with my friends who don't have headsets
2024-06-03,"I’ve barely touched any of the games and experiences listed in the review.  I use my headset practically everyday because of the social interactions in Horizon Worlds.  Lots of great content that you can explore for free with groups of people.  This wasn’t mentioned in the video, and I know there are a lot of people like me out there. 

..btw I personally have not experienced my wi-fi disconnecting, and I’ve had my Q3 since its been released in October."
2024-06-03,"Well, in just a few months, the little quest elite strap broke on the back so I went with a new strap. And just yesterday when putting it on for the 12th time… The little plastic 2 mm bar connector that our straps pull through snapped off. Now the entire headset is useless. There is no way at all to use it Because a five cent part that was poorly designed and couldn’t withstand the strap going through it too many times snapped off. Quest is trying to make it seem like this is a user problem and I’m still under warranty trying to get this fixed. Look at that part on your headsets everybody it’s about the cheapest part you can see. That should be a metal bar. Like you guys, I’ve stuck a lot of money into accessories with this to not be able to use it at all!"
2024-08-02,"hello. i have my eyes on a quest 3, and am seriously considering buying it, but there's one thing holding me back, but i don't know if i'm just worrying for nothing. could anyone help in that regard?

i am worried about the goggles. i really don't like it when things get too close to my eyes. the sleep masks i've tried are a no go, and swimming goggles, while manageable, are not comfortable in any way.

are the quest 3's goggles better than them? if not, is there an accessory that helps?

considering how the quest 3 will get a lot of use if i get one, i'd like to be comfortable when using one y'know?"
2024-10-31,So whos gonna watch this 6 MOnths later
2025-01-29,I feel like it’s just best to wait a couple more generations till things are a bit more polished I’m bout to go to college anyways so I don’t really have the time right now for these headsets
2024-09-01,I'd be interested in seeing a video on the few games you play and what you like about them. Or you or someone else who already knows could answer here.
2024-06-03,"6 months later, still white strap meaning no use, guy finds he still has no VR legs (because no usage) so the only real use will still be chopping boxes in minigames... too bad"
2024-09-01,Thank for the review.  Can it be used  by a couple to travel using two headsets? Thanks again
2024-10-31,my quest 3 refuses to stay connected to wifi even though I have great wifi so I need to use my quest 2
2024-07-03,So its worth it Even tho i dont have the money im begging mom and dad
2024-10-01,Okay let’s be real here how many of y’all using this to watch corn.
2024-11-30,Is this good for a beginner? Never did vr or anything like that. I'm gonna treat myself and was thinking of a vr headset. Is $500 worth it?
2024-10-01,worst part is that i cannot buy any games on quest 3 because of some paypal glitch. so many other people have reported this porblem too but no fix yet.
2024-11-30,im getting 1 for christmas
2024-07-03,Yo!! I saw  it today for $350 at the pan shop today… a little dirty and the lenses were a little scratched (easily fixed by an expert for cheap) they would have probably taken $300 + tax for it!! I already have one so I didn’t get it. $350+ tax is crazy. For a quest 3
2024-06-03,"Reading a phone via Passthrough? Naaah, not really"
2024-10-01,are some of these game only available for q3 headsets ? i don't recall them in the list on the rift s
2024-08-02,"Im a month late but I am not sure if its the quests fault, because I have had internet disconnection issues with both the quest 2 and my old gaming laptop. Not entirely sure why, but I feel like its not just a quest 3 issue."
2024-06-03,"I can’t believe we still have to chromecast! Like wtf, why is that even a thing? It should be able to cast on all formats by now."
2024-08-02,"I swear every time one of these tech tubers makes a video like this now, the quest 3 is being compared to apples headset and they never mention how apples is 3k more"
2024-07-03,I loved the quest 2 for watching netflix in bed laying down im really excited
2024-08-02,"I had Oculus Rift S but unfortunately it broke. But I wonder if it's possible to connect Quest 3 with a cable or something to play games that I have on Steam and Oculus app (for pc)  I'm considering to buy the Quest 3, but I would like more info before I make a decision. And yeah it would be kinda fun to have the Quest 3 with me if/when I travel somewhere and not needing to have to use a pc. Thanks in advance"
2024-09-01,Can you play quest 2 games?
2024-11-30,seven minutes and you’re gone!
2024-08-02,I just wish the quest 3 controllers were like the quest pro controllers
2024-10-01,"Bro you gotta stop saying ""though"" lol"
2024-11-30,"So in order to play games on this you would need a tv app and buy watch game, idk, I'm thinking about buying one in Amazon"
2024-12-30,"only thing I wish this headset didnt suck so bad at is the charging.
I mainly use this headset on steam games which I connect to using a cable. that cable should keep the headset charged, there is no reason for the headset to die while plugged in and yet it will slowly discharge during use, this is something pimax has over the quest 3 as it doesnt even need batteries it gets all its power from a gaming pc, but the need for base stations is why I still use the quest more over pimax."
2024-12-30,Is he still right 6 months later?
2024-11-30,This video was published 6 months ago
2024-10-31,all i want to know is    is it better then the rift ?
2024-11-30,Thanks
2024-11-30,His channel name is six months and it’s six months after this was posted and the video is about 6 months on the quest 3 what are the chances?
2024-07-03,Can you record real world through the color pass through? I.e P.O.V training video?
2024-10-01,How about watching a 3D movies? Is it easy to play MPO files?
2024-06-03,Apple Vision Pro users will say literally anything to defend their purchase
2024-10-01,to me its a slight refresh on Quest 2 ... not too much of a step but its decent
2024-07-03,Just bought one. I mightve made a mistake but oh well lol
2024-07-03,"I still have a quest 1 from 2019,"
2024-06-03,If I want a work out on Quest 3 I just play Dungeons of Eternity! lol.
2024-10-01,Can i move my fingers whit the quest 3?
2024-10-01,"I bought one today, mainly because though i love vr my current headset was getting more and more problems as it was still the oculus rift"
2024-12-30,I have it for 3months and its great
2024-06-03,the only way you are going to get the sdr effect with the meta quest is if you stop and look for it. compared to the quest 2 its massive. also uplift desk sucks ass
2024-11-30,"Augmented reality is the real light coming from the environment being augmented, hence the name, the quest 2, 3 and 3s and other VR headsets can't show augmented reality, they can only show mixed reality, where the environment is recreated in the virtual world. Like passthrough then showing the virtual additions."
2024-10-31,$499 for Quest 3 and it works for 20-30 minutes before WiFi cuts off?
2024-07-03,"Are there any non games for this? For example, could I virtualize something like national parks or roads? Or mountains to see what they’re like in 3D? Almost like a walking/hiking simulator."
2024-06-03,Is tv series/anime watching experience any good? Like should I buy this or an LED for 500dollars.
2024-10-31,I own the first Oculus Rift. I guess this is a worthy upgrade?
2024-11-30,When is full dive coming out
2024-09-01,"I bought a Rift S a few years back and it was fun but... the resolution is just WAY too low, I can't use it even for 10 minutes without my vision going hazy. So I haven't used it for literally a year and a half.
It was just too painful to use and was very difficult to actually enjoy the games because of it.

But this has a 4K screen? So perhaps it would work much better for me."
2024-06-03,I would say the quest 3 is the best all round vr headset for both standalone and pcvr.  And for gaming its unmatched.  If using it pcvr spend the 20 bucks and get Virtual Desktop its features and useability even for SteamVR is just better
2024-10-31,Darth Vader is really Fucking tall
2024-09-01,recording video on it is really tough for me. you get the file and put it in premiere and it won’t sync
2024-11-30,"This with flight sim, you can do some cool things with mixed reality"
2024-10-31,"I have MQ2... the most annoying things are the greyscale fuzzy passthrough screen that is a absolute eyesore. The other thing I hate about it is the strangers that for some reason ol Mark puts on there. I DO NOT know these people, they could be murderers, rapists...thieves.... does the 3 have that also? Can you disable the whole perimeter thing? They did some kind of update, now it is very wonky when trying to pull the screen closer to view. Does it connect to a PC easier cuz whenever I want to connect to my PC I have to shut it down and start it back up. Thanks for the video!!"
2024-12-30,"just got mine still need to get used to it , i get vr sickness lol"
2024-07-03,Are the visuals/horsepower comparable to psvr 1 paired w a ps4 pro?
2024-12-30,just got it love it   only dow is battery  power
3  ago,It's your router bro. Never had that problem
2024-08-02,"Bad battery performance make it useless, it might take more time to recharge compared to the battery life, this is an area that must be improved, I'll wait for Quest 4."
2024-11-30,"I'm looking for information if meta quest 3 allows you to wear reading glasses, but now I see that it's more important to have a lifting table..... great! thanks anyway..."
2024-12-30,Can I use hands instead of the controllers. I purchased the Meta Quest 3 headset. Does not include the controllers
2024-07-03,"as a quest 2 owner it doesn't seem like it's worth the upgrade, and Q2's are only going for 150€ on ebay, so i'm not making enough back to justify the upgrade. the features i'm looking for in a new headset, OLED and eye trackinig are missing too."
2024-10-31,Can you play multiplay games woth someone who has a quest 2
2024-10-31,Did they fix stick drift? I got stick drift and everyone of my controllers.
2024-12-30,So when will we get VR Games showcase in Anime. ..... I AM still waiting for that to happen one day.
2024-09-01,Can I use games purchased on the Quest 2 on my new Quest 3?? Thanks.
2024-09-01,Still waiting for a better version of VR... I want it like ready player one quality...
2024-10-01,I thought the quest 3 had no screen door effect?
2024-10-01,how is the document editing multiwindov experience compared to a two setup real monitors?
2024-07-03,I'd add one more downside: Only white
2024-11-30,I do not see the screen door effect on quest 3.
2024-06-03,"No. Its not. I've had mine for about 6 months, and have used it a grand total of six times."
2024-12-30,Necesitas un pc para utilizarlas??
2025-01-29,"Meta is a crap company. They sent my headset to the entirely wrong city, didn’t tell me they did so until after it arrived, and refused to correct anything. I had to drive 80 miles on Christmas morning to pick it up off the porch of a vacant house inside a gated community. A month later and they’re still refusing to take responsibility for their mistake."
2024-06-03,Waiting for project deckard
2024-08-02,I do not like to watch ads or advertisements- better if you do no have ads in your videos. Great content but not subscribe because of that.
2024-06-03,"I’ve never had any issue with the wifi on mine, perhaps a single batch issue."
2024-08-02,Is the quest 3 VR or AR? Or can you switch between VR and AR?
2024-07-03,"I think you limited yourself to using the headset as is and not fully unlocking it's potential as a pcvr headset. This was one I if best purchase in the past probably 3 years. I don't thing you can get better at this price. And FYI, steam standalone app for the quest 3 is so good you legit don't need any wire (but I would recommend a bobovr 3 elite strap for it. My only gripe is the battery and by extension the charging speed. It charges too slow."
2024-07-03,Cat review - 6 months later
2024-08-02,"Love the headset.  HATE the controllers.  I'm super torn on feeling if it's an upgrade or a downgrade.  Sure things look better, but my interaction in VR is SO much worse."
2024-07-03,Strength training. That made me laugh.
2024-09-01,Funny thing is I sent a 128gb model for replacement and got a 512gb
2024-11-30,Guys im gonna buy a meta quest 3 so should i buy it is ut very good?
2024-08-02,Dude looks like Zach from saved by the bell
2024-10-01,Is 360 a good price for a used one?
2024-07-03,Eventually they will slim it down so much to where it’s basically wearing glasses
2024-07-03,"It’s great, but the lack of games and entertainment on it make it not worth the price, stick to the quest 2 unless they actually make games exclusive for the 3."
2024-07-03,i bought the quest 2 right when the 3 came out... I feel scammed
2024-10-01,Just had a touch with one of these  paid £300 for 128gb version and when it arrived it was actually 512gb and it was the best price on ebay for the   supposedly 128gb so got a bargain because these are £550-650+
2024-06-03,mi out here with a q2
2024-06-03,I never had problem with wifi on mine. I own a quest 3 and used to own a quest 2
2024-10-01,"Quest2 then Quest3. While the quest3 somewhat improvement, i think the Quest2 is best bang for buck. if you can find a good price on quest3 then go for it."
2024-10-31,So still no real upgrades since quest 1
2025-01-29,Do you need a console to work this
2025-01-29,Best vr headset and I own a psvr2 and an Apple Vision Pro.
2024-11-30,This was uploaded 6 months ago
2024-06-03,The Quest 3 is amazing. I love it
2024-09-01,Oh it's worth it....if you are strong enough!
2024-12-30,"I have a couple headsets in the past and its not usefull after a month. All vr games are the same. If you dont find one game that you ready to spend 1000 hours on, you will be the same. You cannot watch movies, because you usally dont watch movies, you cant play pc games on that because its fullhd that sized up to 110 fov, its like you sitting within a few inches of monitor while game running in window 800x600. And it still live only for 1.5-2 hours. So, dont usable. But for the first vr experience its great. You should try q3. Or pico4 if you dont wonna buy games.

The main feature for me its one and a half apps for certain activities, its fully use MR technology and hand tracking. But holding headset just for that... idk. It does helps with a movies, but you will get tired of that experience and will be just using a monitor eventually. And battery is barely enough for 1 movie or 5 episodes of anime."
2024-09-01,Sell my quest 2 nah I’d rather keep it and buy the quest three get a battery pack headset for the q3 then play that till it’s dead charge it while playing on the 2
2025-02-28,Thank you very much.
2024-08-02,Lol.. yeah you knew the answer before he said a word. Its all kiss up to Meta
2024-06-03,I cant go back to my quest 2
2024-10-01,Maybe you wouldn’t notice to weight difference but not because of the better “weight distribution” but probably because it’s only a 13 GRAM difference
3  ago,"Sort of over this headset. Too front heavy, terrible FOV, bad battery life, low quality mobile games, etc. They need to stop trying to cram so much tech into the front of these units. Give us an external battery that also handles all of the processing power so the form factor can be more similar to the Big Screen Beyond 2."
2024-07-03,"Apple headset is a Cybertruck

Quest 3 is a Toyota Camry"
2024-11-30,Now I don't want to buy one
2024-11-30,Bro lied
2024-10-31,"What stops me from getting a meta quest is the fact that the batteries are sealed inside the headset. We all know that batteries have a finite life and it's not a question of IF but one of WHEN it will not recharge anymore. The more you use it the more recharge you put into the batteries and the less time it will last. For a gamer this is a big point. 
  I don't have a quest, but my big question that prevents me to buy is can you add a battery pack to actually bypass the dead sealed in batteries so the headset will continue to be used... is it possible?"
2024-11-30,Doesnt sound like its still ready for prime time. Ill wait for the meta 4
2024-06-03,never had wifi issues.
2024-11-30,What is 515 grams in cheesburger conversion units?
2024-06-03,"Not too good of a review. Several holes in it actually. The gaping hole of not having used the Immersed app for productivity when mentioning Horizon and other apps is really bad.....like to the point of it may have helped the review have a more positive experience. Then there's the Mac issue. Macs are always limited so he should have AT LEAST tried it on a Windows PC for the sake of the review. I own Windows PCs and this guys review is now pointless for me as my experience would be totally different than his...INCLUDING the fact that some apps haven't made it to MacOS at all and they've been out for a very long time. 

He also doesn't mention accessories that also improve the experience with more battery life, etc. So it creates a super distorted, myopic, view of the Quest 3 after 6 months. The reviewer also seems to be very ""PlayStation 5 owner"" like seeing as he will buy an entire gaming console to play one game and one game only. Not even bothering to see what the console has to offer. 

Sorry, getting a thumbs down from me. Hopefully this comment helps for future ""6 months later"" reviews of tech products."
2024-06-03,Screen door effect viewing movies on Quest 3? I thought that ONLY happened on quest2
2025-02-28,"I have Quest 2 and Quest 3. Seriously, half a kg hanging on your face is NOT comfortable! When these things weigh half of it it could be ok."
2024-07-03,Why arent you playing pcvr with it?
2024-10-31,You want an apple vr? Get a phone
2024-07-03,"So 3 games are the only true good experiences. Alyx, Superhot and Boneworks, 2 of which are kind of a meme. Unworth"
2024-08-02,Bro is saying trash so people use the desk
2024-09-01,"The review is good but man you have to work on the way you speak, it just sounds like you’re blabbering the entire time. You go from the vr headset to the plug for the desk and it just seems like it’s one review. Take a breath, pause for a second, change up the monotone voice. Otherwise great review."
2024-08-02,"A pixel burned out on my Quest 3. I gave it back under warranty - more than a month has passed, the distributor has not yet given any answer or solved the problem. DO NOT BUY, in case of warranty you will sit for months without your device. So what should I do now, buy another one or wait another month? I fly in a DCS squad and my flight partners are no longer happy with me. What can I do - these are all meta cocks."
2024-10-01,"For me, most of these vr games are JUNK! Out of all these games and apps I only found about 3 I like!  Seems like they are making games and apps, just to show they have a lot of them!"
2024-07-03,Can I run my flight simulator software on it?
2024-07-03,I have quest 2.... i want it to be easier to log onto my steam account and play the games my current pc cant handle....wanna play steam directly from my headset without the pc middle man...if the 3 does this...im sold  but...its still motion sickness prone...so yeeeeh that still sucks
2024-08-02,It definitely has a wifi connexion issue.
2024-07-03,OMG YOURE A SWIFTIE
2024-07-03,I have the same thing with the quest 2
2024-08-02,It’s worth it 🫶
2024-06-03,Nice  meta forever
2024-11-30,why does this meta quest gives me a headache?

2024-11-30,"I don't care about gaming, I want to watch movies. Is there any headset good for that?"
2024-09-01,6 months?
2025-03-29,"Does it connect with Androids ? Only fools buy Apple nowadays, Xiaomis do exactly the same for one quarter of the price"
2025-02-28,"If all it is good for is playing games than I am not interested. Whenever VR becomes useful for productivity, then VR will get my attention."
2024-07-03,i still have a quest 1
2024-09-01,Just wish the displays were not so bad.
2024-08-02,What do you recommend for memory? Is the memory upgradeable?  Tx
2024-09-01,"Strength training with weights, huh."

2024-10-01,I tried to like VR but it just doesn't do it for me. I have a PSVR2 and Quest 3. I never use them both. The tech is too big and bulky.
2024-09-01,"The Quest 3 is such an unbelievable piece of trash.
I got mine about 6 months ago and the only thing this piece of sh*t is, is trouble.

- Every single update ends in an update loop where i need to fiddle around with the recovery menu just to get it back up booting.
- Room boundaries do not work or at least no reliable. Furniture often changes position and one time i even had the entire room breaking apart (the floor being non existing, walls being torn apart and so on).
- Performance in some applications is worse than with the Quest 2, because yeah, they upped the screen resolution significantly but failed to increase the hardware specs accordingly.
- Battery power is just laughable, it can't even last a 1 hour session. Charging while using is also a no go because then it get's uncomfortable hot on the face.

All in all the Quest 2 was a much more rounded product. I've never had a single problem with the Quest 2 whereas the Quest 3 gave me problems from minute one.
The device also got replaced one time so it is not a faulty product.

It's just a beta version of a most likely upcoming product and we got to pay for it."
2024-06-03,They still have the nasty material on the head band. Gets filthy and can't be cleaned.
2024-06-03,Quest 3 is the best
2025-01-29,"Bruh, say its an ad"
2024-06-03,"Amazing headset worth buying, passthrough sucks though."
2024-07-03,It doesn't wobble too much hahaha
2024-08-02,RIP echo arena
2024-06-03,Is anybody else bothered by the fact that you must have the app on your phone in order to use the headset?  I don't know why this pi55ed me off to no end.
2024-10-31,im wathing this on a quest 3

2024-11-30,"Trash,  don't buy it  ,wasting money!"
2024-07-03,"Okay I am really overthinking this year so I need an extra opinion on this

Cuz my mindset is oh it's been 7 months since this came out it will be only a matter of time until they release the Quest 4 and I just can't get out of that mindset for the life of me"
2024-10-31,"Problems with VR for me I need glasses most VR headsets do not fit my head as it is weirdly shaped in ways you wouldn’t even imagine and no I do not have any disability face, wise or body wise for that matter"
2025-03-16,I wonder if he's still dating Kelly Kapowski...???
2024-12-30,I just noticed that your head is too big for your body and I cant unsee it
2024-06-03,"I'll buy one when they fix the ""You look like a dork playing it"" glitch. 2:29"
2024-07-03,"Hwy, try Fallout 4 VR on this."
2024-10-01,Had the quest 3 for a day...refunded next day.  The idea is great .The games are just like 1990s  16 bit Nintendo games. MULTIPLAYER is flooded by screaming 10 year Olds with filthy sewer mouths. I had a most horrible experience. Over rated and too overpriced when you have to pay exorbitant prices on lackluster games.
2024-10-31,stop simping to apple man
2024-12-30,so much yapping and no content
10  ago,still a big piece of shit the quest 3. i have it and dammit i wish i had just a pc vr
2024-11-30,i think about it
2024-11-30,partially based on android... LOL it''s 100% android  stripped of google play and XR drivers installed (wich isnt special you do the same thing to compile for a phone or tablet) The UI isn't even that special basickly using stripped android skins with a few tweeks here and there for the launcher (The launcher is what you actuily interact with on android it's your menus settings options bla bla bla what most people would think of as the OS.  it's basickly an app with more premisions than other apps Not sure if it's the main reprojection bubble or not tho..
2025-02-28,Star wars game name please?
2024-06-03,"for me i think the quest 3 sucks ass for pcvr the only good thing is the quality
might just be me"
2024-07-03,Wow what a creepy weirdo! (Coming from ME that says something !!! )
2024-06-03,You look like Zack from Saved by the Bell!
2024-10-01,still don't like the size of the controllers. they are made for a kids hand. if you have big hands they are a PITA! there are the old HTC controllers a dream!
2024-11-30,Looks like a toy for children. Enjoy kids!
2024-10-31,I love The meta quest 3
2024-11-30,Bonus point. Your big gay
2024-08-02,"this feels too much like an advert, dont like it"
2024-12-30,Why do the game graphics still look like a PS1? No point being immersive with such unrealistic graphics. Still feels 5 years too early.
2025-03-16,If you have 10000dolar and if you go to Ethiopia you will get 1000000
2024-07-03,"The only thing holding VR back is the lack of AAA Titles, let alone a Killer app."
2024-07-03,"I had the Quest 2 and quickly got bored, I purchased the Quest 3 a few days ago. Absolute trash, Couldn't possibly recommend it to anyone, Zero difference I can see from the previous version and very little games and quality of the games and 360° videos on YouTube are very poor.

Ideal for single or antisocial individuals, Sitting at home with family ignoring everyone while wearing it isn't for me. I guess the whole Meta business model is a bit like that though, No friends? Fske friends on Facebook, No worthwhile hobby's or experiences in live? VR. I can see why they are heavily discounted and not exactly flying of the shelves. JUNK"
2024-09-01,"Why not just say it’s 1 pound 2 ounces? Why is everyone referring to grams when talking about the weight of these??,"
2024-10-31,"Meta is rtarded. they need to take the damn battery out, and put it on the back instead."
2025-01-29,Should i spend $550 on a 3 or $200 on a 2?
2024-10-31,"After 9 months both controllers broke. I dont get a warranty replacement. Its low quality but one new controller woild cost 77 dollars. My PSVR2 is much more fun. The Quest 3 games are mostly boring. Would never buy it again or any other meta product, just look what a cesspit facebook became
..its just a s*** company"
2024-11-30,Humans about the lose taste of life
2024-07-03,Die EZVIZ DBC Klingel ist definitiv ein Must-have für jedes Zuhause
2024-08-02,Ill wait for a huge price drop or else the next generation. Theres not enough difference from thr quest 2.
2024-10-01,"bro whatever that apple workout routine is, it's doing nothing for you lol, just go to a gym"
2024-10-31,“I’ve mainly concentrated on strength training with weights” are you sure?
2024-06-03,"i have a pico 4 and just hook it up to my pc. The Opics are litterally same with the quest 3 and if you only play pcvr its just a steal for 250$ - 320$.

(i have it since one and a half months and i played 93 hours already, craaazyy)"
2024-12-30,It's your router
2024-08-02,It's still to pricey I will wait a few years until it's 200.00 less.
2024-07-03,lost me at  “I see pixels” Seems like an Apple fanboy to me

2024-09-01,"This VR headset is awesome , the only downside is the battery . It has a battery span of 2-3 hours . Although , I never use it for 2-3 hours at a time so if I put it on charge , it’s ready until the next time that I want to use it ."
2024-08-02,It makes a different deep mark on your forehead.  We notice everything.  Oh that's right you were napping.  It's all good by your partner will get less.
2024-06-03,Why would anyone buy a quest 3 when we can download quest 64 for free?
2025-03-16,weird~weird~weird~
2024-08-02,2 is better dan 3
2024-08-02,"Commercial  look awesome but reality is just suck , that why they dont let you try it out in store ."
2024-10-31,Bro needs the gym
2024-12-30,John
2024-10-01,"not comfortable when wearing it for a long time, a lot of demo content but actual games still looks like it's from the 80s-90s graphics, screen door effect when watching content.  No wonder VR isn't mainstream.  I hope it does but most average consumers shouldn't buy this VR.  The tech really needs more development"
2024-12-30,"Anyone looking to buy a brand new meta 3, message me please."
2024-10-31,"Video was five months ago, but says six months later ️"
2024-10-31,Best free games???
2024-07-03,This guy always sounds like he’s always gonna say something bad. I’ll take his review with a grain of salt since 10 grams of weight is to heavy for his soft neck to handle
2024-06-03,Quest 3 native games remain shit … must use it as a PCVR headset for maximum gains
2024-06-03,I like the meta quest it is realy cool
2024-11-30,cap on my app
2024-10-01,"Today, I played in the quest 3 and it causes me pimples, what to do with that?"
2024-12-30,"Ok, so... how much Meta payed you?"
2024-12-30,No it isn't
2024-09-01,meh
2024-09-01,"I just bought one for my sons birthday from metas site. Came in and the screen stays black, no troubleshoots worked.. I’m so disappointed"
2024-12-30,"my sister got one for Xmas and when I tried it it felt like a wii that goes on your face,  graphics and controller was very similar to the original wii"
2024-06-03,"Yeah no, still looks stupid as hell , il stay with normal games thanks"
2024-06-03,NO.

2024-11-30,
2024-09-01,Can someone please recommend some games that's worthy of me keeping the quest 3 because honestly the only thing I've been able to do is watch movies and multitask. I don't want to keep playing these childish City Pac-Man looking Roblox looking games I want some AAA games like modern warfare for Grand Theft Auto or even something where I can run through the house in augmented reality
2024-07-03,"I returned mine. Not even remotely worth what they’re charging. I don’t care how much h it costs to make it, that doesn’t make it a product that I need. My gaming systems & 75” OLED destroy this every single time and this was a hassle to use."
2024-12-30,"I brought my November 30 and bring it back December first , after 15 minutes that thing gave me a headache, that I thought I gone die. Not worth a penny. This guy got payed for the video propaganda."
2025-02-28,lets face the facts that this product is very good only and tailor made for disabled person.
2024-09-01,Not worth it... I trowed mine out the window actually
