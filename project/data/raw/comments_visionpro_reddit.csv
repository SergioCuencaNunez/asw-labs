2024-02-03,">Finally, I can't drink tea with this on. I'm sure that's funny but every time I lift my mug up to my face, it clinks against the visor and I have to be very careful about how I angle it to get a sip. I don't know if this can even really be solved for (maybe a slimmer facial profile?) and I know this is very silly, but it just leaves me asking myself ""why not just use a regular computer?""

Introducing the apple straw"
2024-02-03,"This is the kind of review I've been waiting for. Thank you for sharing your experience with practical use cases as well as your solutions to overcome challenges you met as your were tailoring the Vision Pro to fit your needs. I also appreciate that you didn't just think about what you can do today, but the possibilities as time goes on."
2024-02-03,"I believe I’m going to return it as well, but for me it’s 100% about pass through. Moving around my house or even my head from side to side I see the exposure changes as I move past a window. The entire image looks like a heat wave coming off a road on a hot day. The motion blur is very noticeable but I could let that slide if the image quality was as seamless as it’s been marketed and falsely reviewed as.

The device is super comfortable funny enough I don’t really realize the weight. The FOV is very limited and that’s something I’m not a fan of since it feels like I’m peering through foggy binoculars. 

I really want to love this thing. The technology is so amazing and immersive when it works. Oh! And not being able to see your phone is such a killer, like that’s where you can’t help but see how just how blurry the outside image is."
2024-02-03,"Apple is foolish for not properly integrating it with mac os. They wanted to build it out into it's own thing. If they want to appeal to many working people, they should have built Vision OS up from mac OS. But they choose an insufficient base OS with a more limited productivity ecosystem. Yes, the entertainment features may be great but for $3,500, at least make it easy to do things you will expect should be possible with the current ecosystem like a more tighter mac os integration and multiple screen support. The latter is so much lost opportunity and many people can't use it for productivity - a clear place it could shine.   


Bad choices by Apple that will fail people thinking this can replace their computers. It can but Apple doesn't want to do that and I can't fully understand why. Perhaps, they want  to build it out as its own ecosystem but that's just flawed. It should integrate primarily with the existing ecosystem, and I know then that more people will buy it."
2024-02-03,"This is a great review. I’m having a tough time as a professional creative keeping this thing. Maybe it’s because audio doesn’t play through the headset when you mirror your Mac. Maybe it’s because of the fatigue. 

But I will say there’s one place where it absolutely unquestionably excels and that is if you are photographer and you want to look at your photos or edit your photos in a virtual gallery. There hasn’t been a headset high resolution enough to do this that was widely available until now. 

I was blown away by even editing photos on my Mac on this huge screen. It’s very impressive.  

But my professional work that makes money is video editing, not stills. And I’m really torn on that. My normal monitor is a 40 inch 5K wide screen. The virtual screen approximates a 16 x 9 ratio screen. So I’m actually losing usable real estate with the virtual monitor. 

It’s like you get to choose between screen, which is great for playback as you’re working, and easy on the eyes, or actual productivity. 

I also noticed that websites do not load the full version. I did a side-by-side of the Apple Vision Pro website on the Mac next to the native Safari, and two different versions of the site were loading. The native version was loading a more cut down version of the site. Like an iPhone version. I think.

If you buy this thing, now, it’s more for the future of it than the present of it. And it’s very very expensive for the future. 

I am extremely torn, because I love gadgets, and I love virtual reality and I love looking at my photos as a huge gallery. But it’s hard to justify the cost. 

Also, I own a quest 3 so most of the virtual reality aspects are covered by that quite nicely… (the two devices are incredibly similar minus the Apple ecosystem, eye tracking, and of course the resolution which goes from “good enough/solid” in Q3 to “man this is almost retina” in AVP) 

Meta really has done an amazing job for the price vs Apple. 

I will say as a mass market device there’s no way on this beautiful earth that this will ever take off at this price. As the OP said, the average person is going to be scratching their head. 

It needs to be iterated and cost reduced. But at least Apple had the guts to start. 

But it’s so beautiful watching movies and looking at photos. There’s nothing else like it…. Period. 

So I don’t know what to do

EDIT - I’m keeping it. For photography and as a huge remote monitor. But I’m also selling some unneeded gear to fund it.  MKBHQ’s most recent review from last night sums it up well"
2024-02-03,"Agree with you about the beverages. I had a mental image of someone who exclusively sipped through a straw of one of those Stanley mugs that are so popular right now and it made me laugh. I definitely need to plan to take beverage breaks!

I know it's only been a day, but I'm curious to know where you're at on keeping it! Are you going to spend a few more days figuring out your use case?"
2024-02-03,How is the porn on it?
2024-02-03,"This was a great, well thought out, hands-on review. Thanks for sharing. I bought the Vision Pro and use it for seven hours total yesterday with the original band and had no issues with the weight at all. My neck did not hurt, and neither did my eyes. I thought I might wake up today with a stiff neck but I have no issues. So I do think it’s very subjective the weight. For example, somebody that’s used to riding motorcycles wears a helmet and this is not as heavy as a helmet. I do agree with some of your other points. However, as far as it being single use, so you can’t really share with others. I think that will improve with the time as more more people bond (years down the road, of course) but I do think things like that will get ironed out. Limitation of one screen on the Mac is disappointing, but I do believe that will get fixed in a future update with software not necessarily a new version of the headset. I am definitely gonna keep this thing, it’s the best piece of tech I born a long time. I also agree about not being able to see the iPhone not being the greatest. Luckily, I have an Apple Watch so my phone will unlock even though I have Vision Pro on, but it’s not very easy to see the screen and scroll through it. I saw somebody made an app where you can have your iPhone screen show up on your vision, pro while you scroll through it, I gotta try to find that app again."
2024-02-03,"Good review, thanks. I have read that an app called Juno is for YouTube in the AVP."
2024-02-03,Not being able to fully use for work but specific parts of work. Well said. I think this is probably how I’ll use it. I’ve tried to do some real work… it’s rough so far. Checking and responding to email on Mt. hood though? Super cool!
2024-02-03,Its good to see honest reviews from non creators. I said this before it came out. Alot wont really know what/when to use it for but it is an awesome experience . Some are really hyped up but its just not worth for the amount of use for them. Ive been dreaming of this device since AR came out. I know what im using it for and when.
2024-02-03,Won’t be buying till they make a space for my coffee cup to my mouth hole!
2024-02-03,"spot on！VR is best for movie and games, other than that, it's pointless"
2024-02-03,"> However, one of the reviews was right: it's magical until it's not anymore.

Which is what happens with most VR headsets. Any of them. Most people love them at first and then shortly afterwards they sit gathering dust. It's only a minority that keep on using them."
2024-02-03,"I've been a mixed reality developer for almost a decade, and this review is amazing. Hits the nail on the head in terms of understanding what this device is capable of and its limitations. I hope some of the stuff we build may convince people to buy devices to get the kinda experiences you described. The idea is that you can scan an environment with an iPhone and share it so people can hang out together in person or remotely."
2024-02-04,"RE dog: i haven't run into that problem. I can see him just fine

https://preview.redd.it/e4us8absehgc1.png?width=2472&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5c13bf86a23fa9c1c2fd91e55c8e6a91975374f"
2024-02-03,I’m finding it odd that people think the weight issue will be solved over time through their neck muscles strengthening. What’s far more likely is you’ll do yourself long term damage through the ongoing strain. Particularly given that much of the issue is due to the device being front heavy.
2024-02-03,"All great points and fair criticism. To one point there is an app floating in this sub that mirrors your iPhone to the device. I haven't had a chance to try it yet (dealing with lens issues) but people seem to love it.

Great point on the beverages, maybe it's how we don't become characters in Up, being forced to get up lol"
2024-02-03,"Almost sounds like some people need to get use this kind of tech. Like the OG iPhone was, it was awkward to use it at first and had no apps for it but over time it was widely accepted especially after the App Store and now it sells 100’s of millions of units per year. 

OP, maybe give it another week or so and see if you feel the same way about it. If you do, then yes return it. It seems you really like it but you’re trying to think it through logically and really no one can at this point. It’s new tech and it’s going to take a bit before it has more adoption and use cases."
2024-02-03,"Anything, literally anything, becomes „less magical“ after a while. That‘s not the fault of this product. That‘s just human psychology."
2024-02-03,Ummm youtube doesn’t even have a MacApp “scratches head”… but fair enough. Its just not for you.
2024-02-03,"As a movie buff, it’s easier to put on the Vision Pro than to drive all the way to the IMAX Theater. So yeah, maybe this product isn’t for you."
2024-02-03,Man everyone keeps saying heavy but like it’s lighter than so many other headsets. As someone who uses an index quite often im for one excited for how light it actually is
2024-02-03,"Sort of expected, it’s not match your use case"
2024-02-03,"Seriously all, do not listen to these people. Try it for yourself."
2024-02-03,"Oh look at me, I’m a totally real average person with a totally real average person post history and the totally real average person tendency to publish an 80k word essay on why I’m returning the AVP 😆🙄"
2024-02-03,"I can almost see the NFL setting up a live immersive camera rig (or several) and selling AVP users the ability to live stream a game, switching easily between camera spatial views, during the game.  Jump down to the sideline view.  Up to the Birds Eye view.  Etc at will.

Of course they’ll sell this virtual “Gameday AVP experience ticket” for $1000 per game but hey…..it’s a game played by millionaires, owned by billionaires.  Of course it exists to make money."
2024-02-03,"Can I ask you something? I created some mods for Pimax and Meta Quest. Can you remove the light cover and try to keep the lenses as near as your eyes where your eyelashes still don’t touch them?

Can you explain how it feels? Bigger Fov? Distortions? Where do you feel bigger Fov? Eyestrain? Thanks!"
2024-02-03,if you are returning it can you just give it to me??
2024-02-03,">However, if they end up adding functionality where I can get a seat at a stadium for a soccer or football game and feel like I'm there

That may be coming in the near term, but I think the future of watching sports will include a ""god's eye view"". For example, on the Manning Cast (Monday night football), [they pretend that Peyton Manning has that ability](https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/-/media/Images/Daily/2023/11/06/SBJ-TECH/manningcast-peyton-eli.ashx?mw=768). Basically, the ability to view the game from any position in real time, as if the field and players were miniaturized and the game being played on a table in front of you or on the floor of your living room. In fact there's a company that is currently working on developing the capture technology to support this."
2024-02-04,Average person can’t afford this product.
2024-02-04,"I haven’t bought one or used one, but all these reviews are reminding me of the launch of the iPad. The foundation is there, just needs an oomph, hardware-, design-, and app-wise. 

It’s a marathon with Apple. 

Great write-up!"
2024-02-03,$99 for the *silver* and $149 for the *spatial grey* versions.
2024-02-03,*$200!!!* 😇
2024-02-03,I’ve been saying this for ages. Many people may hot stream concerts or sports in VR if they can’t enjoy a beer during.
2024-02-28,"The Apple Straw pro max is made of polished titanium, comes in 6 stunning color options, is top rack dishwasher safe and retails for $249.95. This magical device automatically tracks your liquid caloric/nutrient intake and vibrates violently if too much sugar or caffeine is consumed. Double tapping the side of the straw activates “suction free mode” engaging the 4 mm miniature turbine pumping the liquid directly into your mouth with zero effort."
2024-02-03,He hit the nail on the head I’m returning for similar reasons
2024-02-03,"The return rate is going to be so high. If it were in a sweeter pricing spot, people would be more tempted to keep it but any hesitation at $4k after taxes will push people to get their money back after they have fun with it for a few days."
2024-02-03,Can't see your phone? I see mine just fine.
2024-02-03,I wanted to love it to but I don’t want to risk going beyond the return window to fix some of the bugs. Do you think they give a hard time with the return policy. Like do we have to package it perfectly when we return it. I’ve never returned anything to Apple in my life
2024-02-03,"IMO the FOV is fine. Any larger and your eyes would have real trouble ""looking"" at the periphery. This FOV is the maximum where my eyes feel comfortable and I don't have to strain/reach."
2024-02-03,Is there any warping or distortions on the passthrough like the quest 3?
2024-02-04,"Everything in the interface of macOS is designed to be pointed at with a cursor and clicked on. The buttons are very small for that reason. Apple made the right choice — if productivity software is coming to visionOS, it needs to be written from the ground up with the hand/eye tracking interactions in mind. iPadOS is a good base because the touchscreen design language fits well with the way Apple Vision Pro is interacted with."
2024-02-03,"Well said! I kinda experience this with IpadOS, so I will be wary of this new ecosystem."
2024-02-03,Looking forward to the Apple iStraw for beverage consumption.
2024-02-03,"I'm like 95% sure I'm going to return it. I want to keep it perhaps selfishly because it's really cool, but I don't think I can justify it in any rational sense. I'm going to keep it over the weekend and play around with it more, though."
2024-02-05,Do you think a slender cup would help you out if not taking breaks? A cup with less diameter and more height like something between your typical teacup and champagne flute?? Just a thought.
2024-02-03,There’s a reason the Vision Pro comes with a cloth.
2024-02-03,"i cant put it into words

![gif](giphy|Wck09E7lHDabjhHbzJ|downsized)"
2024-02-03,"Big screen porn. That’s all it is. If you want more immersive porn, get a Quest 3 and sideload SLR."
2024-02-03,"The one screen limit at first seemed limited to me, but then I realized I usually have other monitors running Slack, email, browser, etc so it might not be the limit I was thinking. Still a couple weeks until mine arrives so we’ll see. I mostly got it for TV and movies, and the reviews on that are pretty universally good."
2024-02-03,What's made real work rough for you?
2024-02-03,I was able to drink a regular cup of coffee with it this morning - it does take some extra thought not to hit the bottom of the goggles - but it is possible. At least it was for me.
2024-02-03,I wouldn't say is that it's pointless. It's just that the technology hasn't matured yet. It will absolutely change the world in ways we cannot even imagine of yet.
2024-02-07,“Take that stoopid thing off your face and take me for a walk!”
2024-02-03,"More likely a 3rd party strap will come out that’s better. Just not as aesthetically pleasing as Apple prefers.

Just as they have with the Quest line. I also think it just affects some people more than others."
2024-02-03,"The body definitely adapts. I played football (American) through college and every spring the neck and upper back has to adjust to weight of helmet. But, I wonder if posture is what is key.   
Is this tradeoff better than the forward head posture that we have due to looking down all the time. Keeping your head in a neutral position with good posture looking straight ahead or up when laying back could be better in long run?  Just thinking out loud here"
2024-02-03,"What happens IME is that you get increasingly sensitive to it and develop neck stiffness increasingly piercing. The solution in my case is a proper balanced head strap, halo style. In the end the good news is that it has a cheap solution, but you have to factor it in the price and bulk for transport."
2024-02-03,"Yeah this is boggling my mind too, I've never seen people say this stuff about strengthening neck muscles with any other VR headset. I've used VR for years and I'm pretty sure my neck muscles haven't changed lol, uncomfortable headsets are always uncomfortable until you upgrade the strap. I assume its to cope with the fact that people are spending $3500+ on it."
2024-02-03,"Haha yes. This will be terrible for ergonomics (unless you lay down on your back to work I guess).  You can mitigate some of the issue by getting another strap and counter-balancing the headset, but it will still be worse than not wearing a headset at all.  

That’s why I’ve been so confused about all comments about people replacing their desktop setup with this thing. It’s like they’re begging for their body to start aching."
2024-02-03,Would a chair with headrest help?  Or a gaming chair that reclines?
2024-02-03,"Oh, definitely want to try that app out. Do you remember the name?"
2024-02-03,"I completely agree! This thing is definitely the future, and I’d love to participate in that. I’m just worried that given where I’m at as a generally pretty average user, this device isn’t for me yet (but it will be in time!)"
2024-02-03,"I dunno. The first iPhone was pretty easy to use. I personally never felt it awkward. 

And it did come with killer apps. The phone, text messages, and music player. Those alone made it a device that was in constant use. It was the first(?) screen with capacitive touch, blowing away the screens on devices like the blackberry. 

I just don't think it is a proper comparison. I remember using my first iPhone all day long. Or at least it was on and nearby me 24/7. 

All this said, I do think that enhanced reality is a future for humanity. But it needs to be closer to the ""eyes"". By that, I mean regular eyesight. AR eyewear that isn't much more than standard glasses. But obviously tech isn't small enough or light weight enough for that yet. 

Still, this is a case where Apple might have been better off using more plastic to reduce weight. Maybe the outer screen isn't that useful? Weight to lose and it doesn't matter if people see your ""eyes"". I am sort of surprised that they didn't move the CPU or other mechanics to the back for counter weight. Or even just drop it all the way down with the battery if you are going to require a cable. I mean, if you are going to cable it - throw as much stuff down to a waist clip and make the headset just the screen and cameras."
2024-02-03,It’s weird cause it kind of feels more like a bunch of iPads than it does a Mac.
2024-02-03,"Watching a movie at an IMAX theater is still a way better experience than watching on the Vision Pro though, mostly because the sound is much more immersive and powerful in the theater."
2024-02-03,"If that’s all you wanted, the quest is way cheaper"
2024-02-03,Can you connect it to a AV Receiver via USB C to hdmi or is the battery strictly for charging? I’m sure the sound from the headset is good but I think a home theater sound system would be even better.
2024-02-03,This simply means it’s technology not yet ready for the masses.  it doesn’t mean apple didn’t do it well
2024-02-03,I’m sure they can decide for themselves. There are plenty of positives in here. No reason to discount the negative.
2024-02-03,"This is exactly what I’m hoping for (minus the potentially exorbitant price tag)! They teased a little bit of this in the demo with MLS and baseball, and because Apple handles MLS streaming I imagine they’ll do something for this with immersive features. It’s such an awesome use case and I can’t wait for it to become more commonplace!"
2024-02-03,Also waiting for this!
2024-02-03,Does it drink for me?
2024-02-10,$249 for Cosmic Black Space Dust.
2024-02-21,You need to try the twisty straw
2024-02-03,Drinking in vr is very easy. Like in vrchat it's full of alcoholics who drink all day without even having pass through. Just keep drinking and you will learn.
2024-02-03,"watch for an onslaught of ""refurbished"" models"
2024-02-03,Mine was like $3745 after taxes
2024-02-03,Good that will push Apple to be realistic about their pricing
2024-02-03,"I wonder if this is a case by case situation. Even the reviewers claimed they can see just fine, while one said they can’t see text."
2024-02-03,"I can’t see my phone very well at all, but I was able to play both Palworld and Fortnite by using pass through to see my TV"
2024-02-04,"They're pretty lenient with returns in my experience. Make sure you don't ding or scratch it, bring the box and the battery, and you'll be fine"
2024-02-03,"Even the quest 3 that has high FOV, the FOV still feels limiting. I don't understand how some of you can find the current fov perfectly fine. In the future people will laugh that our devices had such limited FOV."
2024-02-03,"WTF? That's not how that works at all or what FOV is. It would cause your eyes any trouble. All it'd do is improve immersion and *not* look like you're looking at a screen or through goggles.

The coping mental gymnastics are real."
2024-02-03,Nope fov is key for immersion. The higher the better. Looking thru binoculars destroys immersion so fast your head will spin
2024-02-03,"No,It feels like you are nearsighted and don't wear glasses. -2 to -3"
2024-02-06,">Everything in the interface of macOS is designed to be pointed at with a cursor and clicked on. The buttons are very small for that reason. Apple made the right choice — if productivity software is coming to visionOS, it needs to be written from the ground up with the hand/eye tracking interactions in mind. iPadOS is a good base because the touchscreen design language fits well with the way Apple Vision Pro is interacted with.

The truth is that that won't scale for obvious reasons (price being the biggest as it's simply unaffordable for the average person). It's going to be a very very long time before that happens and the truth is that that time may never come. As it stands that today, vision pro is not a productivity tool for professionals which is something we all know it can already shine at.

Explain to me why they only allow macs to have one projected screen on vision pro (not even an extension!). Why do they not allow multiple mac screens if they already allow one? Considering many people were looking to make this their next productivity tool, with a asking price of $3.5k, this is just downright bad. I'm certain many people won't be able to justify forking that much for something so limited at a feature it can clearly shine at. To many, it'll be seen as a toy. A ""glimpse into the future"" when it can already be that future today (at least in this regard). The reason for this? Only Apple knows."
2024-02-03,**$200!!!** 😇
2024-02-03,At what price point would you say you would consider it a keeper? I love my Q3 but for anything over 600$ I would dismiss it instantly (for my use case which is light gaming/fitness).
2024-11-20,Use a straw.
2024-02-05,I actually really like Blender Bottles!
2024-02-03,Are you supposed to jerk off into it? I didn’t know that.
2024-02-03,Are you able to access any sites? Or are you just using files you already had downloaded? I’m so confused! 😂
2024-02-03,You don't need to sideload SLR with the DeoVR app.
2024-02-03,I think I just need to get used to it mostly. The mouse pass through doesn’t work all the time. Safari is pretty tough to navigate compared to the Mac. Without a keyboard and trackpad I don’t think I could even attempt “real work” but I just need more time with it. For context I run a marketing/software integration company so I’m in a web browser 10+ hours a day on top of a hundred other apps including adobe suite. So it’s still tbd on what I can really do in the VP. Planning my day and checking emails so far has been super impressive and I’d consider keeping it just for a peaceful morning planning routine.
2024-02-04,So not even kidding but a non traditional mug shape may solve for this. Like and angled oval opening. Or something with an open spout design. So it reaches your mouth but doesn’t hit the AVP on tilt.
2024-02-07,Don’t worry. He got his walks and snaccs and play time
2024-02-03,Keeping your head in a neutral position whilst it is battling against a downward force at the front of your head isn’t going to be any better than bending your head forward. Holding your hands in mid air to type isn’t gonna be great either!
2024-02-03,">I've never seen people say this stuff about strengthening neck muscles with any other VR headset.

That's because a lot of people who got the Vision Pro are new to VR and think it has something to do with their neck muscles as opposed to the weight pulling the HMD down your face or if tightened then giving you local pain on cheeks or forehead and eventually headaches from the pressure. They'll learn. A lot of people with experience tried to explain this here and in other subs as well, but it was just labeled as ""hater speak"". I guess everyone learns from their own mistakes, just in this case it's a tad more pricey."
2024-02-03,Using a virtual keyboard isn’t going to help either. It’s an awful idea ergonomically.
2024-02-03,Yes! Using it while reclined was a big relief for my neck.
2024-02-03,"Bezel - Device Mirroring: https://apps.apple.com/app/bezel-device-mirroring/id6476657945

I listed this and a bunch of other interesting launch apps here https://vision.rodeo/app-roundup-1/"
2024-02-03,"If you truly feel that way, like I do. Then keep it and enjoy it. I too am an average user but I feel in the next year I will be using this a lot. Watching live sports more movie content, concerts etc. Not to mention the many apps that are yet to come as adoption becomes more apparent. Plus your photos and videos will be amazing to look at as well. Obviously you only know yourself but I feel a lot of people need to give this thing some time and not dismiss it right away. Just my .02"
2024-02-03,"This is true. The sound on the Apple Vision Pro isn’t even close to a movie theater. You can kind of approximate that with AirPods max which I haven’t tried to wear yet with the AVP because I’m not sure they will fit.

Edit - the Max DO fit while wearing the headset, and they do connect to the AVP. But for some reason they don’t work. No sound. 

I also tried wearing them while doing a virtual Mac desktop. But it didn’t work because for some reason the Apple Vision Pro is causing too much Bluetooth interference.

The AirPods Pro, that I have DO work just fine. And they are the older generation. They sound much better than the built-in sound which is fine, but not particularly loud and particularly lacks bass."
2024-02-10,"And the Quest has much lower resolution, among other things. 

I haven’t used the Quest, so I have no frame of reference for comparison, just the specifications and what other actual Quest users have said about the image quality, which sounds far inferior to the AVP.

Of course, the AVP costs may 3x or 4x(?) what the Quest does, so it should at least be smoother and better visually.

I did the 30 minute demo at the Apple Store, and I was really impressed with the visual quality, and pleasantly surprised at the sound quality. 

I’m not buying this generation of the AVP simply because I don’t want to spend $4K+ on something that I’m not even sure I would use on a regular basis once I get tired of the novelty. It does not seem ideal for work. I don’t think I could (or would want to) wear this kind of headset for 8+ hours at a time. Tempting as it sounds…I a-lso think that this first model will be quickly outdated when the second gen comes out in 1-2 years.  Maybe at that point I’ll think it’s worth it to spend that much on something which for me will have such limited use.

I do think that AR/VR is the way of the future. And the technology will become much smaller, lighter, less obtrusive, and of course much more powerful.

I did see some interesting other AR/VR glasses-type products, i think one is called the XReal Air 2 Pro? Something someone on a forum pointed me to. Only around $500 + maybe an extra battery. It’s nothing near the level of the AVP, i mean only 1080p, but looks pretty interesting, and supposedly the PPD is fine enough to read text.

I’ll have to try them on at a retailer just to see whether they’re worth $500. Oh, and they weigh 75 grams."
2024-02-03,I didn’t say Apple didn’t do well. I’m just saying that it’s a lot lighter than other headsets and I think people have expectations that it will be .5 pounds or something and there is only one headset like that and they are basically goggles and still in alpha development

2024-02-03,"Reading through my emails on iphone in dark mode with dim lights and I can read text fine, not crisp and clear, but it's easily readable. I find tiny, tiny print is hard to read. Turn up the lighting in the room improves readability some.  I'm commenting on this on my pc looking at the monitor through AVP pass through and it's worlds better than Quest."
2024-02-03,"I think it depends on how bright your room is. When your room has light, then the exposure on the cameras doesn’t have to be so drastic."
2024-02-04,"It’s case by case and depends on the lighting. By hook or by crook, this setup is determined to send a new frame to the screen every 12ms. That’s required to help reduce the motion sickness, BUT physics says there’s only so much they’re ever going to be able to do with 12ms with today’s technology.

When I did a demo at the store, I was showing the Apple employee the setting on my phone that made the setup difficult. I navigated and read with no problem. Just like there are folks today that go to great lengths to ensure their work space is tuned for them with desk height, proper lighting, seating, etc., there will be folks that, if Vision Pro is the way they’re going to work, their environment will be tailored to it. 

Not being able to read on Vision Pro is like not being able to sit comfortably in a bad chair. It’s 100% absolutely a thing that a lot of folks may not even be able to do anything about, but if they can or want to, the solution is clear."
2024-02-03,"I find it perfectly fine in my opinion because the eye tracking is what drives the immersion for me, not the FOV. You really cannot compare this to the Q3 because Q3 does not have eye tracking. I agree a higher FOV becomes critical to being more immersed in a Vr headset without eye tracking like Q3. However, with eye tracking, I find myself looking around the center of my screen but not so much in my extreme periphery because it would strain my eyes too much."
2024-02-03,VR headsets have been around for almost 10 years and no-one has been able to release a well working device with high fov. They all feel like looking through binoculars. Probably very difficult to solve without introducing severe distortions to edges of image.
2024-02-03,"I agree it would improve somewhat improve immersion but good luck with the distortion caused at higher FOV. My point regarding eye strain is given this is an eye tracking device, any large FOV would make it difficult to look at the periphery. It's would not be fun ""reaching"" with my eyes to the extreme left or right of my vision at anything higher than 100 degrees. Not coping, just giving my opinion."
2024-02-03,"I have owned the og htc vive, index, quest 3, and now the apple vision pro. The immersion on the vision pro blows every other ""VR"" headset out of the water, even though those headsets have higher FOV. The simple reason is eye tracking is a much better medium for immersion than simply increasing FOV. Again this is just my experience. I understand that increasing FOV would increase immersion on a traditional VR headset, and probably wouldn't hurt here as well, but I have not been limited by the FOV of the vision pro personally. Just my two cents."

I did watch a video showing some of what it looks like when using it, and I think it’s fairly priced for its capabilities. I just don’t want one and wouldn’t use it. It looks uncomfortable. 

The AVP is definitely priced very high—but I do also think that due to the level of technology, materials, construction, cameras, data bandwidth, screen resolution, camera resolution, and the really pretty much flawless interface interface and immersion, that the price is reasonable. 

But—and I’m speaking only for myself, not making a judgement on how others can use it—I don’t see it as being very useful to me at its current level of development. I think I could really only mostly use it for entertainment. Because it’s don’t see myself spending a full workday using this. It seems like it would be much more effort and more inconvenience than using my computer. And I don’t want to spend $4K on something that will provide such limited enjoyment. 
Maybe when the price comes down to around $1K, I might consider it, especially if it’s more capable."

Okay, as retired Apple Expert, I got to try the AVP and get trained on it a week or two before it was released, and I think your review here is absolutely on point.   I couldn't agree more with everything you say.

I am also one of those people who bought one (hey, at 25% off why not).  It gave me the chance to really use it outside of the demo experience that customers in the stores see.  It truly is an amazing device, but after a week or so, I realized I didn't have a solid case for keeping it.  So it went back.  Even at 25% off, it's still quite expensive.

But this is as you say, generation one.  It wouldn't surprise me in the least if the second gen is lighter, not as bulky, less expensive, and by then, developers have come up with apps that make it more useful for the average person."
2024-05-12,I absolutely love my Vision Pro and wouldn’t return it for anything. I can’t wait to see what the 2.0 software will bring next month.
2024-05-12,"> * It allows me to use my virtual PC screen (moonlight) to work with it.
> * I have multitasking systems with Telegram, Discord, Mail while the main focus is on the Moonlight screen.
> * It allows me to connect to SteamVR (PC) via ALVR. Yesterday, I spent about 4 hours in VRChat with the Apple Vision Pro and without controllers (using hand tracking to move).

As a long time VR user this is very interesting to me, as these are also the main ways I've naturally gravitated toward using it myself.  
&nbsp;  
The most remarkable thing to me is this: despite ALVR being really good now, uOLED and the optics being incredible, and having a convenient motion controller setup (index controllers), I don't play VR games any more than I have in the past (that is, outside of the honeymoon).  With typical VR I would always settle back to using it a few times a month, and that hasn't changed.  
&nbsp;  
On the other hand, with the vision pro I'm largely focused on using Moonlight (with, as you say, the visionOS/iOS apps on the periphery) ... but I'm often using it *every day* ... often several times a day.  In terms of VR headset usage, this is unheard of for me.  And with some updates, the Moonlight experience could easily be many times better than it is now.  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
The existing VR community has scoffed at apple for not having motion controllers and not focusing on high immersion, embodied gaming/experiences.  Moreover, other parts of the industry have spent tons of money desperately trying to force that kind of usage.  However, all of those billions have been blown in the face of stubbornly poor retention/engagement and for what is ultimately a very small active user base--it has been like towing a tugboat with an aircraft carrier.  Companies either give it a shot but pull out/scale back when they see the consumer's reaction (Sony, Microsoft, Valve, Bytedance), or they continue blowing billions in desperation (Meta).  
&nbsp;  
But the more I use the AVP, the more I'm convinced that form of usage is niche by its very nature.  
The AVP is simultaneously the first headset that I find these other more traditional computing activities to be worthwhile through, and also the first headset that I actually want to consistently use.  I think that once hardware that performs at this level and better becomes more widespread and once people naturally gravitate toward this kind of use-case, you will finally start to see this industry ""make sense"" and not just be an endless money pit.  
&nbsp;  
In the short term, Apple really just needs to:

* Improve comfort (sell a weight balancing headstrap now and fast track gen 2)
* Make visionOS more like macOS and not just iOS
* Embrace mouse and keyboard out of the box (look and pinch still being necessary for more basic and casual uses, like watching movies)

Longer term, the expected hardware improvements to displays, optics, compute, and so on make me very optimistic."

Secondly, the ergonomics of this device are terrible,  they are designed from the ground up to ""look cool"" meanwhile nobody looks cool wearing this thing.  No articulation at the temple, just hard rigid straps is mind boggling.

2024-08-20,"I think there are two key points to be borne in mind regardless of your view, and regardless of whether you’ve purchased it if not.

1. Whether this kind of computing happens with Apple or not, it will eventually hit the right price range and enough people will like it that the company can do a very critical thing that successful inventions in computing do and that help the audience determine if it’s right: Iterations. The iPhone started out as a hand-sized chunk of metal with a big touch screen. Had it been too expensive, development would have been too costly. Fast forward 14 generations and we’re far beyond caveman iPhones. Same principle. Say what you want or don’t want about Apple vision. A lot of us know that we want it to be Apple and we want it to be as convenient and explosive as the first iPhone was, but as effective, intuitive, and streamlined as the latest models. That’s not how evolution works though. The people paying for it are the ones helping the people who think it’s too expensive. If enough of those people wear it around town, Apple might turn over a profit and come out with a Vision 2 Pro, etc. So, either buy it, or talk about it and spark interest.

2. I think people need the perspective that the concept of evolution brings in order to be able to appreciate that some of the inconveniences, flaws, etc don’t mean it has to be a crappy movie without any hope of a series or franchise. Dune 1 wasn’t the most satisfying in some ways, but Dune 2 (sorry to fans, I’m talking about the most recent releases and not entitling them properly out of laziness) did a better job in some regards. Tech is better though because its aim is not tradition but the exact opposite. So, remember, this is a “first of its kind” for Apple. To get a computer that looks like Morpheus-style frameless glasses… we have to start somewhere. And, this is that somewhere.  In reality, it will likely not be Apple that wins because the price tag and too many complaints. What people want to see is “THAT WAS AMAZING, LIKE A ROLLERCOASTER, OH MY GOD I’M NEVER GOING BACK…”. It will likely be smaller unheard of companies that are bought out by Apple or a similar giant. Probably made possible thanks to the interest spurred by Apple and earlier, by Google with these very devices.  In conclusion, Apple deserves a huge round of applause for doing and trying. If they aren’t able to hit the threshold of explosive success, then it’s probably technological limitations, not Apple."

2024-05-13,"Developers are not obligated to support a platform with zero market reach and low sales. 

Microsoft found this out with Windows Phone restart after iPhone/Android smartphone market disruption and agitation. 

Ballmer is right, “Developers, developers, developers, developers!”

But why would a developer want to commit serious resources to a market that has no serious financial ROI and other competitors in the space are primarily secondary video game application devices? 

Oculus and Sony sell their headsets where most of the software is gaming related, and it’s not the full game but a limited, sidestory type of gaming application related to a franchise with a stronger base of sales on other devices. Resident Evil 4, wow. ONE AAA GAME, OMG TAKE MY MONEY! I already beat it 5 times on PlayStation. 

I’ve had AVP for over 2 months. It’s mostly fruit slicing type stuff, and that’s not worth $3499. With market entry cost to consumer beyond the normal means of 80%+ of any consumer demographic, the entry cost to a developer is astronomical. 

It becomes a negative ROI opportunity cost, where just because Apple is asking for developers doesn’t mean any of us wanna waste time for 1500 installs over the next 9-12 months. It’s not selling and from what I have heard from some devs, it’s very slim pickings for growth. 

Even a communist country such as the USSR was damaged by supply vs demand issues, hence the Five Year Plans they never followed. And they eventually rotted from the inside from over supply and static demand, which caused monstrous losses to factories who had built more bolts that was necessary for a half decade outlook. Equilibrium was never reached and the market went wildly out of control. 

I bring up the USSR because Apple will have to FORCE developers to create for the platform if the dreamed of or hoped for customers NEVER SHOW UP. 

And as a consumer, the 10th time using the environments is a severe decline in joy. I have to turn it down to get up to pee. It’s sometimes loud and I have to turn sounds off, which ruins the experience. 

And 90% of consumers don’t care about or even understand all the technical nerd gobbledegook. 4k to them just means pretty colors. 

And then the moat damning problems:

1.	absolutely bizarre first gen product problems including no Handoff connectivity with iPhone such as unlock iPhone using AVP, a what the fuck question about text input and how ridiculously basic it is, a UI with multiple obvious UX design flaws that violate every basic rule in the paradigm including hovering UI prompts that obscure the very text field you are trying to type into (obvious QA fix six months into interface design)
2.	an App Store flooding with widgets. The Widgets feature of Tiger, Dashboard, was used so infrequently, Apple NEVER improved it and it became the appendix of the OS, before being removed. Some of these widgets are basic UI elements such as time, battery indicator, etc that should have been there DAY ONE, and not a paid app from a developer. This includes the ridiculous missing Beach from the environments, whate are the working on? The waves?
3.	gimmicky 3D movies that all I have to do is point to Universal Studios attempt to push it in the 1980s and it flopped so bad you only see 3D at an amusement park. Or I could just point you to 3DTVs, et voilá. I’m sure we all wanna watch dinosaurs in 3D over and over again for 10 years of this product. Yeah, sure, we’re getting full content, oh wait, just a sidestory.
4.	overly zealous nerds who cancel naysayers so they can keep their circle jerking and persuade people to buy it who will immediately regret it right after the return window closes (me).
5.	competitors in the space have struggled to get to 5 million sold of their products over the last decade, which tells every developer and market analyst that this market is tiny, niche, and no amount of strapping a Mac to your face for $3500 is going to change that. Developers balk, and the product dies with gimmick apps that do basic UI functions that are mysteriously missing, or boring 3D gimmicks that wear out their welcome over time. 
6.	solipsism. The user is the only one who can see or interact with the device, meaning they have to buy one to join. And AirPlay mirroring to a TV basically just says “we could’ve just bought an OLED 4k HDR TV instead”
7.	ridiculously expensive and fragile. One drop and it’s broken."
2024-05-12,"Thank you very much! I understand that there might be expressions that don't translate well, but it's good to know that it's understood.

Apple needs to move towards a lighter product, either by reducing more than a third of the weight from the front or by distributing it towards the back to help balance the product.

Devices like PICO 4 or Quest Pro excel in this regard. However, obviously, due to the power of the M2, including the battery at the back would be challenging, but they could add some of the hardware at the back of the head or include it externally along with the battery.

With a lighter and more affordable next generation, with all developers creating spatial applications and a much more stable and versatile VisionOS, they are going to create one of the best Extended Reality ecosystems."

Up until 3 months ago, we had a very specific conception of the uses that headsets should be given, mainly Virtual Reality. Meta has been reigning over technology in recent years and setting the course. But is it really the path that should be followed?

Then, Meta tried to launch something similar to the Apple Vision Pro with the Quest Pro, and it was a resounding failure (although for me, who still owns them, they remain a great headset).

Furthermore, we must add that the problem with Meta Quest devices lies in their own foundation, their operating system. Being based on Android, Meta Quest has a significant burden with multitasking, and as of today, it is unfeasible to create a multi-window system (it only allows us to display 3 applications on a virtual ""tablet"" without being able to separate them).

They have always wanted us to stand up and exercise, but if we look at the industry, practically the majority of the use we give to entertainment devices of this kind is while sitting: consoles, television, mobile phones, computers. Not to mention the productive side, where practically most of the time in front of a screen is spent sitting.

And oddly enough, in the past, technologies that tried to make us stand up ""failed"": Eyetoy, Kinect, PlayStation Move, etc.

It's curious that, for example, SONY with its first PlayStation VR wanted to force us to sit (also due to the deficient technology they used), but oddly enough, the Oculus DK1, DK2, and even the launch of Oculus CV1 were for that use along with an XBOX controller.

Although to be honest, I would like it to be the user who chooses based on the content created by developers how this hardware should be used.

Moonlight works wonders, it's really awesome, and I even like it more than Immersed (because it's an instantiated app). I wish Moonlight would allow the use of real multi-monitors and thus take advantage of the ones I have or even virtualize some, but well... Moonlight is intended for the same purpose as on mobile phones and tablets/iPads, yet it has incredible potential."
2024-05-12,"Exactly what I'm saying in the disadvantages is that Apple really needs to improve the weight of the device by a lot. Even if you can get used to it, it's not normal for all the weight to be just in the front.

About the invention... It was just something I played around with yesterday... I had to remove it because the weight went up to 1.25kg 😅😅"
2024-05-12,"While it sucks that some people find it uncomfortable, one thing often lost in these discussions is the huge variation in comfort just due to physiology and taste. Declaring that AVP “is uncomfortable” is like saying a piece of clothing is uncomfortable: it’s a 100% valid personal statement, but not an objective truth.

It’s certainly not comfortable enough for enough of the population. But the majority of people use it with one of the two straps it came with and are good."
2024-05-12,With some application? How do you do it?
2024-05-13,Have you tried using Firefox?
2024-05-12,"No, it’s not. But anyways, it’s our product and I’m proud to mention it in my extensive review 😉"
2024-05-12,"A rather significant portion of AVP owners are also owners of MacOS computers rather than PC, in which case they have no use for Moonlight.

I also use both Mac and PC, but I don’t think most people do."
2024-05-13,"Indeed, I use my PC via WiFi. I have a specific router solely for wireless connections with the PC (technologies from other headsets like Quest's Air Link, SteamLink for Quest, PICO Link for PICO, etc.). So, I have the network quite optimized; I don't experience any noticeable lag when using any application.

When I use ALVR, the experience is 100% immersive, meaning it behaves like any other Virtual Reality headset. You can use hand gestures to move and interact (though it's rather mediocre), or you can, for instance, connect JoyCons (yes, Nintendo Switch controllers) via Bluetooth to the Apple Vision Pro and use the stick and buttons to navigate in VR.

If you want something more complex, you could use Valve Index controllers or even Meta Quest Pro controllers, but that requires more setup."

2024-05-13,"Interesting points but…

>overly zealous nerds who cancel naysayers so they can keep their circle jerking and persuade people to buy it who will immediately regret it right after the return window closes (me).

Isn’t this all on you?"
2024-10-12,"When I bought it I wasn't sure I was going to keep it past two week return period but I kept it and I now use it almost daily. I mainly use it for watching movies and TV shows. It is the best device I have ever used for watching movies. Just amazing.  I don't find it heavy or uncomfortable. I actually don't understand how it can be perceived as either of those? It is not an easy device to ""test"" quickly in apple store you really need to spend a bit of time with it and as you do you will find you just want to use it more and more. It is the future."
2024-05-12,Do u use moonlight mainly because you use a windows computer?  With someone who has a MacBook there’s no real reason to use it right?
2024-05-12,"Oh trust me, I get it. I've tried all sorts of hideous contraptions with mine too. That's what frustrates me about it. I really couldn't believe I was sticking 3D printed pieces to a brand new $4000 headset designed by Apple. It really only takes about 1 day of use to determine there's issues with the weight distribution and ergonomics. I really feel they dropped the ball on this part of the design, and I'm hoping they offer an advanced strap similar to how other VR headsets did to solve these issues."
2024-05-13,"> Declaring that AVP “is uncomfortable” is like saying a piece of clothing is uncomfortable

If enough people find a piece of clothing *subjectively* uncomfortable to the point where:

* you see daily posts about comfort modifications
* all major reviews mention comfort issues
* second most upvoted post for its dedicated subreddit is a comfort mod

We can say that such clothing has an *objective* design problem, no?"

2024-12-27,"Are you still using it for tv and movies? That sounds so comfortable lol I have a rift headset and don’t mind the weight just because I’m excited to be alive for this technology. 

The screen quality of that for videos is terrible though and I’d never choose it over an actual tv screen/phone"
2024-05-12,"Indeed, I'm using it like this because I use a Windows PC. There would simply be a reason to use it with a Mac if your operating system doesn't support this function due to having an older Mac. It works natively and looks better than Moonlight."
2024-05-12,"Actually, since they made the decision to remove the battery from the headset, they could have taken advantage and removed part of the hardware like the M2 and its cooling system. Magic Leap and Magic Leap 2, for example, has the hardware in the pack that goes on the belt. That way, they could have significantly reduced the weight, although I understand that dissipation in the pocket would have been an issue.

2025-01-07,"Alien vs Predator is supposed to be uncomfortable. You have limited number of flares to drop and its hard to see in the dark, and the Aliens, obviously, come for you in the dark. Mostly. But all in all AvP balances the marine by giving him access to a lot of heavy weaponry, the predator is balanced as well, but all in all the playing field is equal. So I don't know what you are talking about."
2024-05-12,"There’s a use case for Moonlight for users that have a MacBook that connects: a second monitor and access to both OS simultaneously.

It’s somewhat of a niche situation, but I often have to remote access my desktop PC when I am working away from my main office with my MBP because of certain software. 

It’s nice to have both while in Vision space. I expect that it applies to few people."

avp = apple vision pro

you're in the subreddit for vision pro - a virtual reality headset made by apple."
2024-05-12,I think it was a conscious decision to keep the battery heat away from the processing which is what would throttle performance
2024-05-12,"The cable for a 100fps 8k display would be thick and inflexible,  not at all like the current tether."
2024-02-02,"I picked mine up about 3 hours ago, and have spent over 2 hours in it so far this morning. My initial thoughts: 

- The eye tracking and pinching is insanely accurate. Really impressed with how it works
- The displays are super crisp and it’s true that you can’t see any pixels. Far better than any other VR headset (have a Quest 2 and Quest 3)
- The device feels somewhat heavy on my face, but I was able to wear it for 90min without it being uncomfortable with the solo band. 
- I haven’t used the Dual band much at all besides to get it fit around my head; it does a better job of distributing weight, but it’s way more finicky to put on and take off. I think for now, I prefer the solo band.
- FOV is fine; you can see the black “binocular” borders around your peripheral vision, but they sort of “disappear” until you try to look for them. So far it doesn’t bother me.
- Passthru video is lower quality than I was hoping in my house. It’s far better than my Quest 3, but the colors and graininess are a bit disappointing 
- Navigating around the interface is pretty fluid and you get used to it pretty quickly
- Extending my Macbook display is pretty cool, but I still prefer my ultrawide monitor setup. Also, my work Macbook is older (Intel) and the mouse tracking is super laggy, but it works perfectly on my M2 Pro Macbook Pro. 
- The battery cord is absolutely the worst thing about the AVP. I feel like the cord is always getting in the way and I’m worried that I’m just going to knock it off my desk
- My Persona is creepy AF and I will have nightmares
- This one was weird: I had a few screens docked in my office, then I went downstairs to below my office, and I could “see” through the ceiling because the Vision Pro recognized that the screens were docked up there. I couldn’t really interact with the screens because they were facing away from me, but that was wild. I forgot to close a window when I was in the basement and could see it when I looked down, and it took a few tries to hit the X"
2024-02-02,Let’s say you are wearing the headset and you have a bowl of chips in front of you. Would grabbing chips with you thumb and index finger trigger the pinch to select gesture
2024-02-02,"Just picked up mine a few hours ago.  One of the main reasons I wanted it was to use it with my MacBook Air.  

It works flawlessly as far as lag and using the mouse and keyboard but the image quality is poor for some reason.   I've tried resizing it many different times but only the small section of the screen I'm looking at is in focus, everything above, below and to the right/left of where I'm looking is very out of focus.  It's almost as if there's a intentional blur going on but it's very distracting when looking around the desktop and at multiple windows.

Has anyone else noticed this?

The optimized apple apps all look fine such as safari and mail.  Nice and crisp.

I am running the Mac at the recommendended native resolution fwiw."
2024-02-02,"Been dicking around with it all morning. After just a few hours, I was certain I would return the thing. 

Now that I'm mirroring a Macbook, I'm more into it. Having the functionality of an actual computer just turns it into a spatial display, but it's pretty slick. What does work nicely is the mirrored display is its own window, so you can have both functionality of the vision OS and the Mac. I wish I was able to navigate with my eyes and pinch click within the mirrored display though."
2024-02-02,"I’ll also add that the Apple Store demo doesn’t do it justice. Walking around my house and playing with it really hit it home.

Soloband hurt my head pretty quickly, will try the dual band later tonight."
2024-02-02,Anyone try SteamLink yet?
2024-02-02,"Okay, a little late here but I’ve been using it for about 5 hours. I love it, but it’s definitely not perfect (yet, hopefully). FOV, a non issue. Weight, ymmv but I’ve been using the solo band with no problems. I do have a red mark on my face but honestly I didn’t notice the weight that much. Eye tracking, you definitely need to do the calibration. I tried having a friend use it and he couldn’t select anything until doing a calibration. I still have some issues with selecting closer together items towards the top of the screen. Like selecting eye calibration vs hand calibration in settings. Apps, most work, some have issues. I can’t sign into Teams because Microsoft Authenticator isn’t compatible yet. It’s a pretty big issue for those who want to sign into enterprise accounts. VMWare Horizon client, keyboard and trackpad input appear broken once connected to a desktop. Can’t select or input anything. Signal, can’t link the device because there’s no way to scan QR codes. This is probably the most feature breaking issue. There needs to be a way to scan QR codes (and I haven’t found one). Many apps including others I haven’t mentioned I can’t sign into because there’s no alternative except for the QR code. Maybe Apple can use the iPhone to scan QR codes if they don’t want to pass the Vision’s cameras into apps? It definitely needs addressing tho. Overall? It’s miles ahead of everything. The interface takes getting used to but it’s smooth. The pass through is great, I like it more than environments. There’s minimal warping unlike the Quest 3 and it’s better quality. 

I’m very happy with my purchase and I can’t wait to see it improve as more apps are supported and the feature set grows.

Edit: to clarify there’s two QR code issues. Being able to log into iPad apps that present a QR code and log into apps that need to scan a QR code.

Edit 2: VMware horizon seems to be working now. Not sure what happened but I’m not complaining. The scaling in windows sucks but that’s not a Vision Pro issue. I’ve also worn the thing for 10 hours now with the solo band. I have some soreness on my face but that would happen with 10 hours from any headset."
2024-02-02,"Got mine this morning, UPS delivered it early in the day which usually isn’t the case. Typing this post with a Bluetooth keyboard connected to the Vision Pro to see how easy it is to use like a regular computer. Typing with my eyes and fingers got a little tedious and I much prefer using the BT keyboard if possible (though it’s perfectly serviceable without it). 

There is a definitely a slight learning curve to get accustomed to looking at what you want vs thinking one step ahead of yourself and moving your eyes to the next thing. It took a short time of rewiring to “I need to look at this thing to click it first, then move to the next button etc.“ but it quickly became second nature. I’ve tried *most* VR headsets, have a Quest 3 for playing games, and this thing is in a different universe. The passthrough is as amazing as advertised. It’s not perfect of course, since it’s still through cameras, but close enough to where you don’t think about it much."
2024-02-02,Experience of demo was amazing.  Interesting note: there were corporate Apple employees hovering very closely to the local dude who was running my demo.  Reminded me of myself when my 8-year-old wanted to try slicing an apple with a sharp knife.

2024-02-02,"The only other VR ive tried is my PSVR2 which i had since launch. My comparison between the two: 

*Comfort*:

*PSVR2* bulky but confortable. Weight is on top of head so the pressure is on top of the head like wearing a hat. I never wouldve described it as “comfortable” i just never thought about it. Big knob on the back so its annoying to lean your head on something behind you. No light bleed from outside world. 


*APV* Presses into your face. Super uncomfortable because it’s pressing into your face. Even an hour after wearing it i can still feel it in my face. Cant imagine wearing this for more than a few minutes but ill report back in a few weeks. Looks sleek. No knob on the back so i can imagine laying with it would be more comfortable. Light bleeds from around nose no matter how many seals i tried. 

*FOV*:  Not sure on this one, but it *might* be more noticeable on the AVP. when i put it on my first thought was, wow this feels like a pair of binoculars. 

 PSVR2, a 1 size fits all product, and is more comfortable and has no light bleed from outisde. APV is “customized” for head/face shape and is uncomfortable and the light seals i tried let light in by the nose. 

Not super excited after trying it. Cant imagine getting any work done with this on (bought it for a bigger screen for MBP). Will probably return it within return window."
2024-02-02,"I just did a demo at the Apple Store. I also picked mine up.

I’m not sure if I had a poor demonstration or not, but I (unfortunately) came away very disappointed.

- The passthrough was dim and grainy (not sure if the cameras were smudged?)
- It looked like I was looking through binoculars (sort of like tunnel vision)
- It was incredibly heavy, and kept slipping down the front of my face, pressing into my cheeks (I was told I needed to use a + Light Seal Cushion).

I’m on my way home right now. I’m hoping the demo was just underwhelming.

Definitely a little surprised by how grainy and dim the pass through was, and how heavy it was.

FYI - I am a huge Apple fan/user! So this isn’t bait or me being negative to scare people."
2024-02-02,"Is anyone else getting a GNARLY headache very quickly? Unless I'm laying down, I get a really bad headache in the back of my head, down low, basically where the dual loop strap sits. 

I'm getting concerned because if I can't fix this, I'm going to have to return it.

It's definitely not from the 3D effect or anything like that - I don't experience this type of pain with my Quest 2 or 3 or Vive."
2024-02-02,"For other new users, my display windows seem relatively crisp, but the passthrough real-time environment seems a bit cloudy and hazy. The contrast just feels.. off. It's to be expected, but light sources look really weird, too.

Fitting issue or is that what ya'll are experiencing as well?"
2024-02-02,"Had a 9:30 appointment. I was surprised that honestly half the other people being helped were in their 70s. Rock on! I have glasses so they took my glasses and the prescription lenses they matched me with worked great (and I have pretty bad vision). 

Demo was awesome and I can’t wait for my ZEISS lenses to come in from fedex today to start using this tonight!"
2024-02-02,"I got mine. Did the demo at the store.. it was okay. I’m hesitant to post this because some of you can be……. Enthusiastic about this piece of tech, but I’ll share anyway. 

My first thoughts: I’m curious how many of the people that are having “life changing” experiences with these have actually used a VR or MR headset for a significant amount of time. 

It was obviously the most clear and most performant hmd I’ve used and the software seems to be very well done. However, I’m not sure it’s worth $3500 more than my existing hmd. 

Maybe it was just the demo. I didn’t get to do anything on it that I haven’t done before. They had me look at spatial photos and videos which I can do now.  Watched a couple of movie trailers that were in 3d (Mario and one made by Apple)… Big screen can do that now. My HoloLens 2 does eye and hand tracking, so does my Quest Pro. The pass through was better than my Quest Pro obviously, but I’ll have to see how it does in low light. Anyway. That has been my experience so far. 

Annoyingly, I won’t be able to actually use mine to explore more until my lenses get here."

pass through is very good - you can easily see your surroundings but it is quite obvious you are look at screens With some of that “grainy” Texture.

  
Resolution of screens is fantastic. You can easily read text. Coming from an Oculus Rift first generation, this is a crazy upgrade for me.

  
Eye tracking is fantastic. Mirroring other people, I had to recalibrate once or twice as it seems to become slightly less accurate. 

  
One other little gripe - the foveated rendering seems a bit too intense When multitasking. It’s very fast to update, but I feel like I use my peripheral vision much more in real life."

2024-02-04,"My experience so far:

* Passthrough is a bit disappointing. You can easily tell it’s a camera feed. Still way better than Quest 3 (no weird distortion when hand is moving over background)

* Display is amazing when digital content is shown. Very high resolution - close to retina level if not already. Contrast, colors, and dynamic range look similar to a high end TV

* Movie watching is incredible, especially in theater mode. The display quality is way way better than my Quest 3 and even better than my LG OLED home theater set up. Makes me want to re-watch my collection. Watching content on the plane will be my main use of the AVP so for this reason alone I’m keeping mine

* Feels a bit heavy compared to Quest 3. However after switching to the alternative strap I was able to watch a movie for 2 hours and forget about the headset.

* The Persona is incredible. Very realistic and responsive. Zuckerberg would want this for the metaverse but all he could come up with is Roblox-like characters. There should be big potential for the persona. Wish you can save different personas, like in a suit, different hairstyles, etc."

2024-02-02,"So what’s inventory like in stores? I was hoping to do an in store pickup order today but don’t seem to have an option. Probably can’t visit a store until after work. Can’t imagine they’ll still be in stock then.

Edit: just walked into my local store at 5pm and they had one."
2024-02-03,is BigScreen available for the Apple Vision Pro?
2024-02-03,Anyone that needs glasses to see try using the AVP without them? Is the picture usable? Waiting for my zeiss lenses is killing me!
2024-02-03,"Just got my setup, anyone know if I am suppose to have a gap at the nose that I can see through?"
2024-02-03,I got mine late last night! Great experience so far with minor tweaks needed!!! This will be a fun ride.
2024-02-04,"I got mine on release day.

When it works it is fantastic but I put the battery to charge  all afternoon and now when I plug it into the AVP it doesn't turn on. Also batteries light never went green after charging. Just stayed orange. The electric plug works for my phone charger and other things. I don't know why. It is really frustrating on a device this expensive."
2024-02-02,"Anyone else utterly unimpressed? I've used all the other VR headsets, so I thought my expectations where reasonable, but man this thing is rough. The motion blur is horrible. The latency on Macbook screen share is so high. Tech absolutely is not there yet, but this is the best version of it.

Edit: I've sat with this device for a few days now. Once I shook off the expectation calibration my view on it has improved. It's certainly not as good as the marketing made it out to be, but it is an excellent device for content consumption."
2024-02-02,"just got my vision pro...zeiss lenses 😭

tomorrow can't come quick enough"
2024-02-02,"They are making me open up my box to switch the light seal size? Seems odd, can they not give me a sealed one with the proper size."
2024-02-02,"My pickup date is the 7th but I'm itching for it-- there's no shot I can go pick it up early, right?  👀"
2024-02-02,Got mine :) Is it possible to take a photo with a connected computer screen in view?
2024-02-03,The only thing that makes me not sure my quest as much as i want to is the weight... so AVP is not good
2024-02-02,Is anyone able to view their iPhone in the AVP?
2024-02-03,"Has anyone with amblyopia tried it out yet? I’m interested, but with how heavily it relies on eye tracking, I fear my lazy eye may be incompatible with the tech."
2024-02-07,"I tested one today.its ok... pretty good I suppose.

The video demos are the best in VR that I've seen....but not good enough yet.

The refresh rate seemed low....

The field of view is similar to my G2 .... It needs to be much wider.

Reasonably uncomfortable. Feels heavy on the face. 

Overall, it's impressive, but not nearly good enough for mainstream.
...

I'm not sure why I'd use it. I use my G2 for flight sims and racing sims. I struggle to find regular use beyond that.

2024-02-10,"why do we need this product? has anyone seen videos of the people sitting in parks with these on and in subways, walking down the street? damn idk why people want to be THIS connected to your emails your computers. it’s wild"
2024-02-02,Agreed about the passthrough quality
2024-02-02,you can tap the crown to bring all the windows back to you.
2024-02-02,Thanks for the review!! Why do you say you prefer the physical monitors over mirroring?
2024-02-02,"Yea, I had some unintentional clicks when I was eating today."
2024-02-02,Practice grabbing chips with your thumb and middle finger.
2024-02-02,"If I'm staring at the window's move-bar, pinching and dropping the apple cloth can activate. Slightly gazing at dead spaces when picking up things seems like a good workaround though.

No issues if I pinch & pick up other small items like remotes and phones.

Might be my calibration. My ""releasing"" the pinch gesture needs some adjustment. I have to open my figures a little more than I would like to release. Find myself unintentionally holding."
2024-02-03,how sensitive is pinch to tap? do you have to open fingers substantially each time or a quarter inch would suffice?
2024-02-02,Its intentional. They used foveated to reduce processing power to not render as highly the stuff it thinks you're not looking at. Hopefully in the future you'll be able to control the width of the fully rendered section as to mitigate this in exchange for higher power draw (if you're plugged in for example)
2024-02-02,"Could be something to do with the day 1 software…it’s just streaming, if you can use native apps fine then it’s definitely software related."
2024-02-02,"Ironically I have the opposite experience. Resolution feels great, but the hz lag is felt. Feels like 20fps when I drag a window around."
2024-02-05,"it’s intentional as someone else explained and i just wana add to that. that “feature” also mimics how we actually look at things. when you look at something in real life, everything else around is blurry except what you’re looking at."
2024-02-02,which MBA model is this?
2024-02-02,"> I wish I was able to navigate with my eyes and pinch click within the mirrored display though.

Yea, I agree. It’s actually somewhat confusing if you interact with VisionOS using pinchy-pinch and then look at the mirrored Macbook screen and it doesn’t do anything."
2024-02-02,How’s the audio from the speakers? Compared to AirPods.
2024-02-02,Have you tried the movie theater  experience like in the ads?
2024-02-02,"This would be solved by just connecting a trackpad and keyboard to the VP itself and skipping the Mac altogether.

Once I did that the real ""spacial computing"" a-ha moment hit me. Granted, I don't have the same apps on the VP, but I can see the potential. The VP replaces the Mac entirely."
2024-02-02,"My demo was bad. Not sure why, but I’m on my way home and hoping it’s much better at home!"
2024-02-03,It's destined to become the world's most expensive porn viewer
2024-02-03,"I watch movies more than I do gaming nowadays. I can expect it will get fairly good use when I rewatch a favorite 3D movie. I’ll also probably use it for work as a monitor, since I use a MacBook Pro for that."
2024-02-03,Work
2024-02-03,"Without games idk 

Games kept me going with the Quest 2 and while things like the timer appearing above food is really cool I can accomplish the same thing with 2 physical timers

Ultimately I have a feeling this will end up being a paper weight for most"
2024-02-02,Commenting for an update when possible!
2024-02-02,"Testing it out now, will let you know shortly"
2024-02-02,Maybe you could mirror your screen and then scan that QR code?
2024-02-02,"\> I can’t sign into Teams because Microsoft Authenticator isn’t compatible yet.

So much for Teams being ready on Launch Day! It reminds me of the Netflix app for Meta Quest which still asks you to scan a QR code (from inside of VR, mind you) to log in."
2024-02-03,"I did a screenshot and texted myself the QR code, opened on my iPad and scanned with my phone. Signal works fine now."
2024-02-02,"I’m assuming apple will quickly release an update to address things like the QR code, but you’d think that the early testers would’ve figured that out but perhaps all that works within apple and they didn’t consider other companies"
2024-02-02,I had a pretty obvious corporate employee sitting with me and the retail employee during the demo and she basically interviewed me after lol
2024-02-02,What about selecting keys with your eyes then pinching to select?
2024-02-02,It’s way slower than typing on my iPhone or a real keyboard. Significantly so IMO.
2024-02-02,"That's weird. I found the ""pinch to type"" to be very pleasant to use. I thought the bad reviews of it were surprising for how quickly I was able to type with it"
2024-02-02,"Do they have demos set up even for curious tech nerds who don’t have intent to buy today, or are you expected to make a purchase after the demo?  

 Edit: they have 2-3 people standing by the door with iPads assigning appointment slots, took 2 mins to book mine. Demos were taking place in a seated area on the main floor with curved leather couches"
2024-02-02,Question. Have you used other AR/VR headsets before? Because I feel like that’s everyone’s initial opinion when they try VR for the first time. However after the wow wears off you don’t end up using it. So wondering if this is just that initial “wow” for you.
2024-02-02,Man very similar impressions. The software is amazing but the passthrough past 10 feet was blurry and it was not comfortable at all I can still feel the weight on my face after an hour of taking it off. The fov was small and the edges had a distortion to them that made working on a large text screen not great. Reading something designed for phone would be super clear but designed for a computer screen is going to require you to move your head around.
2024-02-02,"I had an identical experience. I thought I was wearing binoculars. None of the marketing material indicated this; gave it the impression that it was one massive rectangle with great FOV.

My cheeks and head were killing me. My head was throbbing and my cheeks were being squeezed. I was told I shouldn’t feel pressure there, but I obviously did."
2024-02-02,"Good to know. I have a psvr2 so that would be my comparison as well. Have you tried the quest 3 at all? Curious how it compares.

Also how are the black levels?"
2024-02-03,"You have to try a Quest 3.  The lack of wires is a big game changer, especially when you couple it with the more comfortable third-party straps that distribute weight differently and provide extended battery life.  These are under $100.   

I was literally blown away by it when I did an wireless link to my computer and started playing high-end VR games."
2024-02-02,"2/2, 5:14 PM Update: 

I got home an hour or so ago and I gave up on the Solo Band. I couldn’t use it. I wanted to, but I couldn’t. It looks cooler, and more iconic, I couldn’t last more than 5 minutes.

As I explained earlier, and a little more below, this might be because the 33W that Apple prescribed me might not be the right Light Seal size. Just doesn’t seem right and I want to go back and test different ones. 

The Dual Loop is much, much better in terms of weight distribution. It took me a couple tries to tighten the upper and lower strap, but once adjusted, the Vision Pro goes on and off with ease.

I still think the Light Seal I got (33W) isn’t right for me. 

And the Apple recommended W+ Cushion makes it worse. When I use it, visionOS says that my eyes are too far away.

Furthermore:

- The passthrough isn’t great. It’s right around sunset here, and it’s really grainy and dim. Real world is like 50% brighter.
- I’m getting used to the “binocular effect”, although I feel misled by Apple.
- Others have mentioned that things in your peripheral look blurry and I agree. I envisioned the entire screen to be in one focus and sharp, but that’s not the case right now. Could this be related to the wrong Light Seal/eyes being too far away? Maybe."
2024-02-02,Plz keep us updated
2024-02-02,It kept slipping?! Yikes. That sounds like a terrible fit. Mine fit like a glove out of the box. Feels incredibly secure
2024-02-02,Thank you for the real feedback
2024-02-02,You should have got a better light seal size. I switched my size three times before starting the demo
2024-02-02,Just had my demo at the store and had a very similar experience. I was very surprised at the pressure on my face and thought the dual loop band might help but they wouldn't let me try it to find out. The pass through felt much lower res than I expected too but that could've been because the fit was off. Please keep us updated.
2024-02-02,Try to nail down the problem. Try just laying down and using it with the strap pretty loose. Maybe it’s too tight. Or not situated well.
2024-02-02,"I had a little bit of discomfort with the dual loop strap too, but was able to fix it by tightening the strap on the top of your head, then letting the back of head strap out slowly until it no longer pushed the strap out further. It’s worth a shot to see if that helps. Also, make sure you have the softer cushion installed, the other harder one caused me some discomfort too."
2024-02-03,"Stereo video is the killer app. Have been shooting 3d since 2018. We have 2 eyes, it only makes since. Same as stereo music. Only thing is, until there are contact lenses, it would be better to bring back 3d tvs, but lenticular, screw having to put something on our face"
2024-02-02,I had the same problem during the demo. Looked grainy and cloudy.
2024-02-02,"Almost sounds like an external camera issue.

Is it still the same if you go into an area with good natural lighting? Could also just not perform well in bad lighting."
2024-02-03,"It happens, it’s there, but yo u forget about it very quickly"
2024-02-03,"It may not be an issue but for $3500 it’s a valid complaint for many to make considering the $300-$500 headsets are doing better 

I want the AVP but it is a bummer finding out that the FOV is worse than much lower priced headsets 

Maybe it’s my expectations for that price point  but I would have expected the FOV to be better"
2024-02-02,"Everyone here seems to want a revolutionary life-changing experience from avp, and I'm just here hoping I can watch some anime in bed on a big screen on my ceiling in 4k before i sleep."
2024-02-02,"An apple user here for 2 decades and I got the quest 3 last fall out of the blue. I was blown away as i had not experienced AR/VR prior to that. There are so many apps, games and videos that showcase good VR and AR. The price is just right to feel any buyers remorse since its like the 3rd gen and devs have worked and polished  their apps for years.  I am sure with time apple can do the same but glad to see that they have stepped into the AR/VR space so quickly. I will wait for 3rd or 4th iteration of the VP but for now, the meta VR devices are evolving at each update rapidly."
2024-02-02,"I forgot to mention the pickup experience. I had a 9:00 appointment. I was running late and assumed I would have to make my way through a crowd.. I parked at 8:55 and got inside by 8:58 or so. 

They had queuing lines set up, but they were completely empty. Every Apple employee I spoke to kept asking me if I was excited and “what is the first thing you’re going to do with it?”.  I felt like Larry David because I don’t generally get extremely excited about things, so my answers probably weren’t satisfactory to them. 

When I eventually got to the demo table, the guy asked that I bear with him because I was “only like the 6th person to do this today”. 

I live in a small market, but I was surprised there weren’t more people. The only other Apple pickup experience I’ve done is the iPhone and there were long lines."
2024-02-02,Definitely appreciate your opinion here. Thanks for sharing it. I suspect there’s gonna be some downsides to this technology especially early on and that’s exactly what I want to hear about.
2024-02-02,"Why is this getting downvoted? (Nevermind, plenty of upvotes now)"
2024-02-02,"Knowing what the HoloLens 2 eye/hand tracking is, I’m sorry but I can’t help but hear windows mobile pda. This isn’t even close and I feel it’s borderline disingenuous to suggest it’s comparable, but you can have your own opinion. But I know what the HL2 does and it’s bad enough on its own, I can’t compare it to something like this."
2024-02-02,"I don't know. That video at the end of the demo sold me on it. Once we get live sports on this thing, it will be great"
2024-02-02,"The issue I, and I think Gruber brought it up as well, is when you’re using a mouse on the extended Mac display, then go move a vision app, then go back to the display, you want to naturally just pinch on the display. The context switching might take some getting used to."
2024-02-02,Similar experience. Interesting how some people aren’t experiencing this but others are.
2024-02-02,Your eyes have to adjust to any new lens. You will get eye pain the first day.
2024-02-05,I also developed an ache in one of my eyes that night - granted I shouldn't have used it for multiple hours. Feels like an eye muscle is strained. Is this how yours feels?
2024-02-02,"Pass-through works in the perfect lighting conditions, specifically under professional studio lit stage."
2024-02-02,"The eye aching is the only real physical uncomfortable feeling I'm getting, too"
2024-02-02,I tried it. FOV is not that good IMO. If you wear medium -large sides glasses just imagine the frame+outside is black
2024-02-02,what is fov?
2024-02-02,"I'll report back. I haven't heard incredible things about lowlight pass through (i.e., grain). To some extent, Apple can't reinvent how light works (not that that's what you're suggesting), but I think overtime it may improve. Additionally, it doesn't seem like much of Apple's marketing shows the AVP in the dark, probably for a reason!

I get mine in 1 hour. Will report back!"
2024-02-02,"12ms minus processing and rendering time is all they have to play with, so i'm expecting it to not be good in low light. Advancements in ISO and AI can help, but probably not that much."
2024-02-02,I notified a good deal of light coming in from my nose. I couldn’t seem to solve that during the demo.
2024-02-03,Try playing them on Mac and connect it to Vision Pro? Or is it what you're doing already?
2024-02-04,I have both an M1 MacBook Pro and 2019 Intel MacBook Pro. The latency from the 2019 Intel is horrific/borderline unusable. It is ok for browsing but trying to code or do anything where mouse latency matters is unusable.
2024-02-02,"i am having a lot of trouble with text, some things are looking very blurry but idk if its bc thats just my eye sight"
2024-02-03,I honestly thought that would be an M series chip exclusive.  So you can connect your 2018 Mac to your Vision Pro no problem?
2024-02-03,"I did too, you have to readjust the headset. The back strap’s position is also important. If it’s too low, that causes the headset to point upwards, which will create the gap around your nose."
2024-02-02,Same issue. I forgot after a while but still there
2024-02-02,Disney+ is an obvious one
2024-02-03,"If you could pin anything in your home that way, what would it be?"
2024-02-03,Never thought of that. You can’t stream audio from your laptop to the AVP?
2024-02-03,"Picture a 28” monitor in front of you. Now get closer and further away. That’s what it’s like. Screen size is irrelevant in VR. And a 100 foot screen from a mile away is small. It’s all relative.

You can make the screen as close to you as you want, but then you have to look up to see the top and down to see the bottom."
2024-02-03,Yeah I was wondering this too since it was in the ad.
2024-02-02,Yes.  It’s VR. You can place your screen on the ceiling.
2024-02-02,"This is something I tested a few hours ago and it works great. An added bonus is not having to worry about strain from the weight of the device, since it's just resting on your face vs needing neck support, and the dual loop band and solo band are soft enough so you can lay back on a pillow and watch a movie without it being obnoxious on the back of your head."
2024-02-02,Yes.
2024-02-02,It’s that it’s not the exact lenses
2024-02-03,You mean those nature videos where they’re nothing but mammals and they do it like they do on the discovery channel?
2024-02-04,I’m terrified of this nature channel videos. Might be addicting
2024-02-03,"I have a Monday appointment too but after reading your comment, I checked my store, and will now be picking mine up today instead!"
2024-02-03,"Thanks for sharing this.  I was looking for some honest reviews from people with actual VR experience. 

Some of the reviewers seem to have never tried any modern VR headset, so they are naturally blown away by it, but it's hard to figure out whether it's worth it to be an early adopter of the AVR if you already have a Quest 3."
2024-02-03,Will it have absolutely no reflections if one is in a fully lit room? And what about the FOV?
2024-02-02,We need native apps
2024-02-02,"works fine for me, outlook works flawlessly"
2024-02-02,I used my hands when web pages got difficult with eye tracking
2024-02-02,"Eye tracking seems to work better or worse depending on if you have it adjusted correctly. I moved mine a little bit and laid down and the eye tracking varied after that I shuffled it around. It worked perfectly out of the box when I first started using it, so I do think it’s dependent on a variety of factors and positioning."
2024-02-02,I was on the struggle bus here too. Couldn’t make it through setup menus as I couldn’t get the eye tracking to register.
2024-02-03,The eye tracking for me has been surprisingly flawless. But I’m one of the few it sounds like who can’t get over the motion blur.
2024-02-03,"I found that it varies by app. Slack was good, outlook was a a bit fidly"
2024-02-03,"With discord only, I find I have to look slightly above the icon for it to register."
2024-02-02,"I've been using it for 2 hours now and I'm pretty confident I'll only be able to use this to watch movies while laying down. I've had VR headsets since the Oculus dev kit and this thing hurts my head more than any other headset I've used. It's really heavy. And the eye tracking/pinching really doesn't work as well as I had hoped. It keeps selecting the wrong thing, or will select it multiple times, or what's really common is that it just won't select anything at all. Like I'm trying to enter a number and nothing on the display will be highlighted. Maybe it'll get easier with practice. 

It feels amazing to sit on Tatooine and watch Star Wars though. And if you walk around while a video is playing, it's amazing how it really looks like a screen is there in your physical space.

I'm just really hoping I'll figure out a way to get used to the weight


Also, ""worth it"" is relative. If I was working a minimum wage job, no way it's worth hundreds of hours of work. But if you're lucky enough to drop $4k and not really feel it, and you're a tech enthusiast, then yeah it's probably worth it."
2024-02-02,Many of us are on the verge of booking a flight to the US to grab one. Let us know if it's worth it :p
2024-02-02,So worth it. This is going to be how I work from now on. Not to mention the quality of video. Ugh. I'm in love
2024-02-02,It’s really neat and no video can really describe what it’s like to see some of the photos / videos in the AVP. Whether it’s worth the cost is highly dependent on you though.
2024-02-02,"Seemed a bit grainy to me as well, and this was at the Apple Store with bright lighting."
2024-02-02,What kind of lighting are you using it in?
2024-02-02,"What its not like looking out a window?  It's like the quest 3 reviews - the pass through was apparently great, but in reality a video taken by a tiny camera pressed up to your face is going to look grainy in all but perfect lighting.  I don't think they will ever get passthrough perfect, it will never perform in poor lighting and there will always be warping when you bring things close to your face.  they need a different tech, like those see through OLEDs that were debuted recently."
2024-02-02,Oof there it is.. so the passthrough is probably just as bad as quest 3
2024-02-02,Issues resolved and this thing is truly amazing. I initially pre-ordered thinking I’d likely return it after the “wow factor” wore off but I truly think this will be a game changer for me in terms of productivity (I have ADHD and struggle working at home with outside stimuli).
2024-02-02,"I haven’t noticed that too much so far, have you tried both of the cushions? One of them is noticeably harder while the other is way more comfortable and squishy IMO. With the softer of the two, I haven’t noticed that issue."
2024-02-03,Have you updated to 1.0.2? It comes with eye tracking fixes I think
2024-02-02,They walk you through a series of questions and just really walk you through the demo in general and then they just try and see if it’s the right seal
2024-02-02,on both of the lightseal sizes?
2024-02-02,"I also have a substantial gap on the bottom where my nose is.  I asked about it during the demo and he said  ""that's normal"".  I wasn't too happy with that response, especially since the main reason I did in-store pickup was to validate the light seal sizing.  I think that the device comes with a second thicker light seal cushion, so I'm hoping that helps.  Maybe that really is normal though, curious what other people experience."
2024-02-02,I bet the aftermarket starts shipping upgraded seals before long.
2024-02-02,Its not enabled
2024-02-02,what controller would you use with Minecraft?
2024-02-02,seconded
2024-02-02,Because of privacy and security etc I bet you need to be on the same Apple account.
2024-02-02,"Im wondering this too. I have a MacBook with a broken screen, signed into my old apple account. If I need to log into a different account first to be able to use it, then I still need a monitor to do it."
2024-02-02,"Seen thread on macrumors, it does not work with managed AppleIDs so far"

2024-02-03,Was this your first VR experience?  I'm wondering how this compares to the Quest 3.
2024-02-02,But what if I refuse to do business with Facebook?
2024-02-02,"In Charleston, South Carolina, they had plenty. I was able to trade my 256 for a 512."
2024-02-02,I asked them how many extras they had for walk ups and he didn’t know.
2024-02-02,There seems to be plenty in Pleasanton.  I was able to walk in and pick up one around 9am without any sort of line without issue.
2024-02-03,I️ hope we get that one day soon!
2024-02-03,I have astigmatisms. I was able to use it fairly well but once I got them in I could tell it was better. Being able to blow stuff up to unrealistic proportions helped as well.
2024-02-03,I just had this idea of a whole new market for rhinoplasty surgeons in the future who adjust people’s noses to work for vr
2024-02-03,My long beak has this same problem. Tried on tons of different sizes and light seals etc
2024-02-03,"how's the field of view? Can you see at all angles? Like in reality, with our eyes, we can see in corner angles even though we are looking in the center.  
How is this in the Vision Pro? If the field of vision is low or not the same as reality, does it take away from the immersiveness?"
2024-02-04,"Same thing happened to me with a brand new MacBook Air a decade ago. It's a lemon, it happens, take it back to Apple and get it replaced."
2024-02-02,"Not sure why you’re getting downvoted. I think even if people have used VR, there has been a large leap in progress made with clarity and lens the past 4-5 years so if someone is coming from early VR this seems like it will be impressive. But if they’ve used a quest pro, any of the modern pc headsets, quest 3, etc the jump is not going to be that large.

I was just watching the livestream from Bradley and one of the first things he pointed out was how the motion blur for pass through is still a problem even with this headset."
2024-02-02,"Opposite take for me.

This thing was designed for sitting. I haven't been moving my head much, so don't experience any motion blur at all. It feels incredibly crisp, and the resolution is so high, it doesn't feel like I'm looking at a screen. The Macbook latency is definitely not great, super noticeable when clicking and dragging a window or something. But as a 1.0, perfectly usable. I've been using it as an external monitor all morning. Easy.

The last VR device I used was the Oculus dev kit, so... it feels like things have come a LONG way."
2024-02-02,A little bit. Far more motion blur and graininess than I was expecting.
2024-02-02,What about the apps?
2024-02-03,"Same experience here. My Quest 3 is perfect for watching 3D content, which the ONLY real interesting thing in VR currently. Save your money and buy a 3d cam or lens to start capturing content"
2024-02-02,I want to be able to do finger guns at my smart home devices to have them turn on and off like a cheesy wizard
2024-02-02,"It probably depends on how each store handles things. They had me do the rescan and wear the demo unit before they even started packaging mine up, so if I told them I wanted or needed a different size at almost any point before they actually brought it out so they could package it with a different size if needed."
2024-02-02,they seal it in store
2024-02-02,Yeah it might not even be there yet
2024-02-03,Yeah. 15 pro max. It was readable in normal light. Low light it was readable - just :)
2024-02-03,Not perfect but good enough to use
2024-02-03,I have to move it pretty close to my face to read my phone
2024-02-04,Apple will link the screen directly soon so it comes through using casting instead of cameras (software fix).
2024-02-04,I’m pretty sure there’s an accessibility setting to use just one eye of your choosing for tracking.
2024-02-04,That's the case for all vr headsets. Avp is just the most expensive vr headset its not true ar.
2024-02-02,This doesn’t come across in the videos that Apple has shared with us so far. Disappointed.
2024-02-02,Multiple monitors. Nothing on my face. Image is “clearer” even though pixel density on my monitors is lower.
2024-02-03,You’re eating them wrong lol
2024-02-02,Hah. This is the correct answer. :)
2024-02-02,Latest MBA 13.  I guess I could try a 15 inch and see if that is better.  Will try that tomorrow.
2024-02-02,"The mouse and keyboard does seamlessly move over to the Vision OS, but it is a bit clunky. 

The most on-point thing that I've seen echoed by a few reviewers is ""it feels like a dev kit"". Like the first iPhone or Apple Watch, from the tech to the hardware, everything is a bit clunky, but very cool nonetheless."
2024-02-02,"Better compared to the MacBook Air, which isn’t shabby"
2024-02-02,I like it better than airpods if only because you don't have two uncomfortable things sticking in your ears. Sound quality is excellent.
2024-02-02,"Comparing it to AirPods is probably not fair. For being open-aired speakers, though, it's pretty decent."
2024-02-02,"No bass to speak of, but that's because they're sitting way outside your ears. Imagine first gen AirPods with less bass"
2024-02-02,"I've done some media consumption. It's pretty immersive, especially when you turn on the environment backsplash; the world just melts away."
2024-02-02,"For some, sure. For literally any professional implementation, no, not yet. Workflow through iPad OS, for example, will never be as efficient as being on MacOS. Once MacOS is (well, if) available on Vision, for sure. I just don't think we'll see MacOS be a standalone on the device anytime soon. Think iPad OS and MacOS. M1 and above iPads would have no problem with MacOS, but that will never happen. 

To me, the Vision Pro is clearly a media device first, with everything else secondary or coming way down the pipeline.

My personal workflow requires VMs and desktop apps. Could I get by in just Vision OS? Sure, somehow. It wouldn't even remotely be as efficient. I'm not convinced that using the Vision as the display is really as efficient either, but it sure is fucking cool."
2024-02-03,"While I know it CAN be used for work, do you see yourself WANTING to use it for work day in and day out?  Or is this just like a niche thing, like an alternative to using a laptop when you are on a plane?"
2024-02-03,"I’m developing a Pokemon-esque game for AVP. Posted about it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/s/yNrpvkIs7r

Working on multiplayer gaming, could use some beta testers in the meantime!

2024-02-02,"u/Fargle_Bargle just tried out SteamLink and it was pretty epic. I played a quick strike in Destiny 2 on the moon and set my environment to the moon (full immersion, moon on all sides) and made the screen as large as it goes. There was some latency here and there of course, but not any different than I've experienced using SteamLink in the past. Seems really solid so far."
2024-02-02,I’m hoping it’s a fluke and it will be fixed in a few days. Whole purpose was to minimize windows on my actual desktop and move them to vision apps
2024-02-02,I signed into Teams fine...
2024-02-03,"Thanks, that’s a decent if not dumb workaround. That doesn’t fix my other issue of not being able to scan the external QR codes though. One of my work apps we can only register by scanning the QR code we’re given to activate the app."
2024-02-02,Oh it scanned an Apple proprietary qr type code during setup that was displayed on my iPhone so it’s possible. It’s third party apps that don’t have camera access that’s an issue. I wonder if Apple doesn’t want to go down the second device for camera road if they can make a just QR code mode where the cameras on the Vision only pass the QR code data and it’s handled by the OS instead of the app.
2024-02-02,"This is more of a Signal problem than an Apple problem, honestly."
2024-02-02,"For me that was less accurate- I found myself selecting a letter and then immediately looking to the next letter before the “pinch” was registered and it gave me more errors.

I just need to keep using the “look-to-type” option and I’m sure it’ll become second nature. There’s definitely a learning curve"
2024-02-02,"Obviously that’s the case, a physical keyboard is always going to be faster."
2024-02-02,"The more I use it the easier it is to use, I think it’s just so “new” and I’ve never used anything like it before so I was reluctant to use that vs the “touch” type.

I’m thinking pinch to type will eventually be the fastest input"
2024-02-02,"Got a pure demo setup an hour from now, went to store in person and they had some slots. No plan on purchasing yet."
2024-02-02,I’ve built some Magic Leap prototypes a few years ago. Then it’s just sitting in my closet for the past god knows how long. Hoping this blows it out of the water. Demo in an hour!
2024-02-02,Not sure what you mean. Many of the reviewers have been using VR for years.  My friend has been a VR guy for 10 years.  He said AVP is amazing. What other convince do you need?
2024-02-02,"cable zesty money provide disagreeable simplistic squeeze square oil continue

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*"
2024-02-02,"> Because I feel like that’s everyone’s initial opinion when they try VR for the first time. 

That wasn't my initial opinion when I tried PSVR1; wasn't as good as I had hoped."
2024-02-02,Yep. Used VR for a while. This is a VR headset. Not a “revolution”.
2024-02-02,VR’s been around for 30 years. Most of the general public has tried VR at some point.
2024-02-02,Having to move my head around is whats annoying about the PSVR2 lenses. Oh well hopefully they make it more comfortable/better next generation.
2024-02-02,There will be a lot of aftermarket headstraps. Also you just have to get used to it.
2024-02-02,"Havent tried quest 3 but i also heard complaints that it felt like something was strapped to your face. Not sure about black levels yet, but the light bleed from around the nose would probably be distracting during dark scenes"
2024-02-03,Quest3 is light years ahead of PSVR2 IMO.
2024-02-03,If you’re getting warnings your eyes are too far away that can definitely impact eye tracking which in turn impacts foveated rendering which can cause things to look blurry and weird. Definitely would focus on getting the light seal fit issue figured out first.
2024-02-02,Just added an update. Will keep updating.
2024-02-02,Really? Even with the Solo Band?
2024-02-02,"Yeah, she didn’t even offer that. She was so scripted. It was bizarre."
2024-02-02,"Ya, I just took a picture with the headset, and it looks like a camera phone picture from 2012. Odd. I'll take it in next week when things calm down."
2024-02-03,I used the quest 3 and then the avp - I thought/felt that the AVP had less of a binocular feel. Could it be a fit issue? I’ve always had trouble getting the quest 3 to fit just right.
2024-02-02,iPhone was different because it the benefits were immediately apparent. Everyone had been carrying a cell phone for years by the time the iPhone arrived. VR enthusiasts are a small subset of people
2024-02-02,How does the pickup experience work with the demo?
2024-02-02,"I mean why do you think lol, can’t have anyone going against the OMG THIS WILL CHANGE THE WORLD hive mind"
2024-02-02,"Sorry, out of topic, noob here. How do you something is downvoted?"
2024-02-02,"Oh, no I never said the others were anywhere near as smooth. Just that the tech has been here."
2024-02-02,"I agree the HoloLens 2 isn’t anywhere near the Apple Vision Pro, that is why I said it is much more performant and the software is obviously better. My point was that the technology has been around. The form factor has been around. 

Also, The same issues have been around. (I still haven’t tried mine, but when I tried it in the store, I started getting the same annoying pressure on my forehead I’ve gotten from some other devices)"
2024-02-03,"Yeah, it was cool but I've done that before. I sat courtside (in VR of course) at several NBA games.

\*\*\* Of course it is going to be better on the AVP, I just need to see if it is worth the extra expense."
2024-02-02,"it's uncanny because exactly that happened with the Quest 3 (and even Quest Pro) ... different people had wildly different perceptions. We mostly attributed it to lighting but it was still weird how different they were. Sometimes people posted ""through the lens"" shots and we all even disagreed on the quality of *that* and decided that to some extent, people just have vastly different expectations."
2024-02-02,"It's exactly this. I'm still waiting on my Zeiss lenses. I don't know if my vision is *that* poor but I don't really get what people were talking about when it comes to a fidelity. It maybe my eyes, and I do see some reflection on the corners of the display. I’ll report back after I get my lenses."
2024-02-02,"There's another post here from u/Effective-Ad-6731, they said the review from The Verge is accurate, that you can see a black border as if you're wearing snorkels."
2024-02-02,Edit: also I had the prescription lens inserts on so maybe that made a difference
2024-02-02,"That seems more generous of a description than ""binoculars"""
2024-02-02,Field of view. What  your eyes can see before the HMD cuts it off
2024-02-02,"Does it work at all in the dark, or do the cameras always need light to see your hands?  Or do you have to press a button to select on the headset?  I guess one good thing about having controllers is they still work for basic things like pointing and clicking without light"
2024-02-02,"Thanks. Also what’s the pass through situation with other TV screens?

Like if I wanted to pair this with a Wacom tablet which can’t be mirrored. Any screen like a TV or iPad would be a nice test.

I’ll get my personal results in due time but I’m living vicariously through you all today lol"
2024-02-02,"Same problem with the nose in the store, but I've been wearing it at home all day afterwards and you really forget about it. I don't even notice it anymore"
2024-02-03,"Exact same issue. I also dont notice it at home, but now at home the glare is terrible."
2024-02-02,Sad Mac and cheese noises
2024-02-02,"Reading text is pretty blurry for me too…  I have the optical inserts from a prescription from just a month ago,  and text in Safari or subtitles is blurrier than I would expect"
2024-02-03,Yes I can connect my 2018 intel MacBook Pro no problem. Just had to change the resolution and it works extremely well.
2024-02-03,"Great question. 

I really like having discord up on my left, a browser window in the middle, iMessage on the right and music floating somewhere."
2024-02-03,At this point the answer seems no...
2024-02-03,Yeah that makes sense
2024-02-02,"You would think that, but on the PSVR2 i tried using it while lying with the side of my face on the pillow and the screen was unusable."
2024-02-02,That’s what I’m hopeful of!
2024-02-03,Hahahaha
2024-02-04,">Will it have absolutely no reflections if one is in a fully lit room?

The internal reflection in the pancake lens is still there, it's just much less noticeable without a sharp contrast between light and dark.

For me the easiest way to minimize it has been to use one of the environments with a dark mode with low but even lighting, like White Sands."
2024-02-03,Yeah I ended up retraining mine a couple of times after I got used to what I was supposed to be doing. The last time through and I was actually able to use my eyes to type on the keyboard.
2024-02-02,"I think it goes back to what Nilay said right about how we're so used to not having to focus on the input. But yeah, for sure especially with Compatible apps, eye tracking has not at all been good"
2024-02-02,"Third party straps should help I hope? In my case the stock Q2/3 were not bearable for long sessions, with halo-style straps I can use them through a full charge."
2024-02-04,"Ie, if you like cool toys and it costs you less than 30 hours of work, full send!"
2024-02-02,Does it require a us based Apple ID to work?
2024-02-02,"Right now I think it only supports NA - English, etc.  but I think it could work overseas…"
2024-02-02,"Thanks, I was worried after reviews because of the fov/passthrough clarity in different lightings"
2024-02-02,"sitting in my house with the blinds open. very strange, might need to chat with apple since it doesnt seem like other people have this problem"
2024-02-02,LOL nah. Hop on the discord and everyone is saying otherwise.
2024-02-02,"Shortly after making this comment, mine showed up. I’ve been using it for a little over an hour now!"
2024-02-02,"This is heartening to hear. I'm AuDHD (Autistic + ADHD) and have been dreaming of a more controllable sensory experience while using a computer. Once the price goes down and some of the features get polished up, this could really make computers more accessible to fellow Neurodivergent folk."
2024-02-02,That would be the true reason for me!!!  Everything else would be nice but to be able to do productivity with this thing would be a game changer.
2024-02-02,"Same. I have serious focus issues, and being able to block out my environment visually will be a game changer for me. Like noise cancelling headphones, but for visual stimuli."
2024-02-03,ADHD here as well. I find this more calming than my double monitor setup with headphones on. Maybe that will change when I’m in the office with other people.
2024-02-02,I heard one reviewer make the comment he was buying two and was interested in testing the glass. So I think at least one reviewer plans to drop test this bad boy.
2024-02-03,I did yes :( this is all after that
2024-02-02,Did you get your or just get a Demo?
2024-02-02,How accurate is the face scan for the face seal and band? Did you need to get a replacement?
2024-02-02,Yes. Could see it on both. Could just be my face or nose shape?
2024-02-02,That’s exactly what I was told but I felt the same way as you. I wish I had more time to try different seals
2024-02-02,Damn :(
2024-02-02,Can you link to it?
2024-02-02,It's been confirmed no support for Intel macs
2024-02-02,Pretty sure they said it needs to have Apple silicon.
2024-02-02,Apple already announced awhile back this \*only\* works with Apple Silicon Macs.
2024-02-02,"Yeah the UPS app says this is shipped by ""UPS Worldwide Express Saver"" and requires no signature.  


EDIT: which is funny to me because I usually have to sign for Apple devices that are much lower in price."
2024-02-02,You pay 8x more and give your data to Tim.
2024-02-03,The field of view seemed really good to me. I didn’t notice it like I do for the quest 1/2/3. There is some limit compared to normal vision but it’s so minimal that it doesn’t throw off the experience for me.
2024-02-07,I thought the field of view was similar to my G2.... I'm sure it's wider....maybe it's 100 degrees. Not even close to what we all want.
2024-02-02,The motion blur is really strong.  I vould never understand why reviews were not making more of a deal of this.  It limits comfort of movement dramatically.
2024-02-02,Right there with you. The pass through video is astounding. It took my brain a few minutes to realize I was watching a camera feed and not looking through the headset.
2024-02-02,But Brian tong said there was zero lag and he could edit no problem with his MacBook?
2024-02-03,"I’m gonna get blasted for this but I’m massively disappointed and I feel like Apple misled me. I know it’s basically a dev kit but god damn, the FOV sucks. And the latency on the Mac is awful but the motion blur?…….Its fucking jarring."
2024-02-02,I'm really hoping for a baller Home Assistant app that lets me drop widgets in different rooms.
2024-02-04,"There is and it workes great! I only have one eye, so without this I was going to have to return it"
2024-02-02,So you’re saying the bigger screen in the AVP doesn’t justify the trade off?
2024-02-02,The only thing that truly feels clunky to me is the Macbook mirroring. Everything else is pretty smooth.
2024-02-02,"I see. I’m considering getting the USB C AirPods Pro, but I already have the original AirPods Pro"
2024-02-03,What latency issues? I was working with Vision Pro apps and my Mac with no issue. Significantly better than my other headsets
2024-02-03,"Very cool! 

Wish u the best ❤️"
2024-02-03,I️ would love to test this!
2024-02-07,Wait this is awesome where in the strike did it lag you? Doing a deep stone crypt raid with this on would be glorious 🤩
2024-02-02,is it possible to share the screen during a teams call?
2024-02-02,"Slack is an entirely different story. It was supposed to be native in the App Store at launch, but we only get the iPad app today."
2024-02-03,"Yup, definitely some growing pains in version 1. 

It’ll only improve :)"
2024-02-02,"Totally, but it’s just slow either way."
2024-02-02,"Oh awesome, ty for the response"
2024-02-04,"Bought a Vive back in the day, felt the wow, enjoyed the games, sold it in a month"
2024-02-02,Well I don’t know your friend so I didn’t have that confirmation.
2024-02-02,"My company builds software experiences for exhibits, museums, and trade shows, so I have sampled my fair share of headsets.  They all had major flaws and shortcomings--motion sickness being a big issue.  I couldn't keep a headset on for longer than 20 minutes.  From what I'm reading, Apple has fixed a lot of these visual issues for a truly immersive experience.  I don't expect a ""welp, this is perfect"" as the iPhone wasn't perfect upon launch.  But I do hope that I ""see the future""."
2024-02-02,"Yeah, tried a friend’s VR goggles several years ago – don’t remember which ones – and they were pretty meh. Not a wow experience. Very pixelated. Haven’t tried the AVP but by all accounts they are more of a wow experience."
2024-02-02,That's definitely not true in my experience. I work in tech and even most of my coworkers have never tried VR.
2024-02-02,"VR has been mainstream for only 5-10 years at *the most*. The Oculus DK1 came out only 10 years ago, and most people I spoke to about it back then had no idea what it was."
2024-02-04,"The quest 3 default strap is terrible, but the headset is much lighter then the AVP. And as the quest 3 is much cheaper you can buy a really nice 3rd party strap thay will make the headset really comfortable while still spending wayyyy less than a AVP. And you get controllers and wayyyy more apps and games you can use."
2024-02-02,That's crazy they said the scans aren't 100% accurate so we are gonna make sure it fits
2024-02-02,"Glad to hear on the other band. I'm guessing that would make a big difference for me as well. From the start the eye setup was very buggy for me. It wasn't picking up my clicks but the employee acted as if it was normal. 

I think both of us may have had unrealistic expectations for the pass through. It's certainly best in class but you'd never mistake it for reality. Feels a bit like looking at old GoPro footage. Curious to hear if you adjust after a little or just take it on and off a lot."
2024-02-02,"The reviewers all said it was horrible for still pictures (because the cameras likely weren't really optimized for that), but most of them were impressed with the passthrough"
2024-02-02,"Yeah, I was nice about it. I know that have to do it. I just didn’t have much to say until I could try it."
2024-02-02,I've generally had really good experiences at my Apple Store. And yes the workers do seem more relaxed when you break the script and let them talk about themselves more :)
2024-02-02,"Yep, makes sense. It’s just weird because when I preordered I kept getting errors when I’d chose other time slots. Eventually (like after noon) I started over and thought I got lucky with 9am. In reality, I only saw one person finishing the demo and picking up a headset when I arrived and another starting when I left."
2024-02-02,"Sat down, he checked some stuff on his store iPad and then took my glasses to scan them. Had some small talk while we waited and someone else brought an AVP out on a wooden looking tray. He walked me through how to pick it up, adjust, etc… then walked me through the demo. They can see what you see on their iPads. Then once you’re done, you stand in line like normal at the pickup spot. I don’t think they ever checked my ID now that I think about it. Ha."
2024-02-02,It’s the second highest voted comment
2024-02-02,Probably saw it with a negative score for a moment before people started upvoting it
2024-02-02,Agree on the reviews pretty much glossing over this use case. Would be one of the reasons I'd get one.
2024-02-03,They have dedicated IR down facing illuminations in the hands so that tracking still works fine in the dark.
2024-02-03,"Yeah, I’m seeing like reflections of what I’m looking at it in each lens. I guess glare. It’s rather unsettling."
2024-02-03,It might be wrong prescription or lenses… I read perfectly
2024-02-03,It’s way faster than hunt and peck with the finger.
2024-02-02,no sure. But I vaguely remember someone saying that you do need a US Apple ID
2024-02-02,i’ve been buying VP apps with my Canadian account all day…
2024-02-02,"You have to remember, many ""journalists"" today aren't paid to be objective anymore; they are paid to generate clicks for ad views. And if you say something controversial, the buzz brings curious people in to hear an ""expert"" talk trash about a product whether the reader/viewer already decided they love or hate said product."
2024-02-02,"Hmm, can't tell ya; mine is still out for delivery...

But based on what you said I would have guessed you were using it in an area with relatively low lighting. If it feels like 20 fps, then something may not be right."
2024-02-02,That doesn’t really answer it.. is it sunny? How big is the window? Do you get a lot of natural light with your window facing? Any additional lights? It’s still a camera based headset so lighting is crucial.
2024-02-02,lol nah I’m literally wearing it and it’s barely better.
2024-02-02,I honestly think this will be amazing especially if there are some dedicated apps for neurodivergent folks to improve productivity. Can’t wait to get mine on Sunday!
2024-02-02,Reminds me of when they would line up to get a console before everybody so they could smash it in front of everybody waiting in line.
2024-02-02,Demo units it’s all done through demo units
2024-02-02,Yup! Had to get a replacement
2024-02-02,"I couldnt find one that didnt let light in by my nose. The questionnaire dealt more with comfort, as opposed to light coming in."
2024-02-02,In store demo unit
2024-02-02,"> Could just be my face or nose shape? 

That's my guess."
2024-02-02,"Hey, i’m noticing the same thing but honestly it’s not breaking immersion for me and I have to look down really hard to even notice it. I’m guessing it’s normal after seeing others’ comments and Ray Wong (reviewer with early access) also noticed the same thing but said that it’s not bad at all for him either."

2024-02-02,Perhaps it works less seamless on older MacBooks with slower wireless
2024-02-02,it reminds me of early days of airplay. hopefully gets better.
2024-02-02,It's not really bigger because of the smaller fov. If you make your screen huge you won't see a lot of it.
2024-02-02,"Not yet, although I haven’t spent time to really fine tune it. But I also have my Macbook connected to a 40” Ultrawide monitor so it’s not like I’m suffering over here haha"
2024-02-02,"Unless the charger is really that important to you, I wouldn't. I upgraded to the USB-C Pros after losing my original pair. There is no noticeable difference in sound quality."
2024-02-03,"Just tap the testflight link! Should give you the steps to beta test! And thank you!

https://testflight.apple.com/join/NXwVzIZo"
2024-02-09,"It wasn’t really a Vision Pro issue and wasn’t at specific points, it was just a slight bit of latency (which occurs with every game streaming platform). I always notice it but it never really negatively impacted my experience since I’m used to it from other streaming services like Remote Play and Xbox Cloud Streaming. That’s the only game I’ve tested so far,  but it was epic."
2024-02-02,"The point is this is not for everyone.  Get it don’t get it, it’s a personal decision.  We can only go by what others say or experience it ourselves instead of forming an opinion first and then try to satisfy that narrative."
2024-02-03,"Yes, they spent an additional 30 minutes after my demo trying to find the right light seal"
2024-02-02,"Got it. I'm most curious about face sizing, I don't trust the size I was assigned at ordering 

How did they scan your glasses? Did you take your prescription with you as well? My zeiss lenses just showed up"
2024-02-02,It wasn’t when I replied mate
2024-02-02,Oh.. make sense. I’ve always wondered if I missed a function or something
2024-02-02,"That’s correct, only keyboards and trackpads are supported as of now. I was able to pair a Bluetooth mouse, but it told me mice are not supported and asked me to unpair. With a keyboard attached, though I don’t have any productivity apps installed so can’t speak to individual apps,  I feel like I can browse at near desktop speed. Typing without a Bluetooth keyboard can be pretty tedious so for any type of productivity, BT keyboards will definitely help a lot."
2024-02-03,Strangely using it in brighter lights this am the glare is gone
2024-02-02,yeah that's what macrumors reported a while back: https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/apple-vision-pro-apple-id-set-to-us/
2024-02-02,"its my home office, its cloudy outside but its the middle of the day so i dont see it as a low light condition. tried turning all the lights on in the house and openning all the blinds and its still the same, very grainy looking passthru with visible motion blur when i move my head. maybe not 20fps but definately not a smooth motion. if i look out the window its just a white blob of light with no detail lol."
2024-02-02,That’s brutal.
2024-02-02,"Shame, how does that work if you order for it to be shipped to you"
2024-02-02,I’m wondering what my options are then cause it’s kinda distracting for purposes of trying it. Do I go with a larger seal?
2024-02-02,Ah gotcha thanks 😊
2024-02-02,"Interesting ty. People say the new pros have a chip which enables lower latency between the Vision Pro and the AirPods, but idk how much that matters 🤔. I guess I’ll wait and see if people do comparisons"
2024-02-02,"i find APP2, lightning or usb, is a considerable improvement to the original ones, on every category"
2024-02-02,"This is my biggest anxiety. I've got a huge head. Like my motorcycle helmet is a 5XL. And Apple assessed that I would be ok with a Medium band. And I didn't see any way to change it or to see which sizes were appropriate for one's head circumference. 

I'm looking forward to mine arriving, but anticipating that I won't be able to use it until I return to the Apple Store to un-botch the automated sizing."
2024-02-02,"Sorry, just seeing this. Yes, just scan your glasses. No need for your prescription. The scan is only for the in store demo.

You also rescan your face and they update your box with the correct interface if needed. (They have people that reseal them or something in the back)

&#x200B;

Re-reading this - they used a device that they place the glasses on. I think he called it a Lensometer."
2024-02-02,So you were wrong?
2024-02-03,"Yeah, I’m about to get up out of bed and go try it in my bright living room. I’ll report back!"
2024-02-02,Hmmm I would say that’s not normal as turning lights on would dramatically improve my pass through on my Quest 3
2024-02-02,"Nah, they had extras in stock"
2024-02-02,"I have tons of light coming through with my other headsets, you stop noticing it very quickly"
2024-02-02,"If changing to a different seal doesn't work,

maybe a ""cheap-make-shift fix"" could be ""good enough.""

like adding tape or stuffing some cotton or something soft in the light-gap \[which I'm assuming is a minor slit\]."
2024-02-05,Ty
2024-02-02,"Me too, re: head size - their sizing app wrong"
2024-02-02,My size changed several times. I think the one I got today is different than the first two times I scanned.
2024-02-02,I’ve been wearing it for a couple of hours now since it was delivered. I do feel the solo strap is squeezing my head. And I do feel the light seal is squeezing my face.
2024-02-02,Thanks!!
2024-02-02,I have not and unfortunately don't have one handy to test. I do think I remember hearing though (could be wrong) that the port was only for charging and couldn't be used for accessories or other USB-C peripherals. I'm unable to test though so somebody else can check to be 100% sure.
2024-02-03,My glare comment was about last night btw.
2024-02-02,"yeah, weird for sure"
2024-02-02,"Yeah, tbh I kinda prefer it this way. It's something you get used to, but it allows you to glance down and still feel a bit connected with reality. The Metq Quest Pro is pretty open at the bottom by design and it works just fine after an adjustment period. I'm sure there will be some purists that would complain, but from my experience, it's not a huge deal."
2024-02-02,Oh that’s actually very helpful thanks for letting me know. This is a new experience for me. I just assumed that all light had to be locked out
2024-02-02,Yup. Quest Pro just floods light in under the eyes and it works fine. Much ado about nothing.
2024-02-02,"I’ll give it a try but hoping I can figure it out, mostly cause for the price I’d like to have something oem work"
2024-02-02,Because you don't look enough like a dork with the VR headset on your face without adding a sock or a tampon or something to your face to get a better seal.
2024-02-02,You’re welcome. Good luck!
2024-02-03,"Same, I experienced glare last night. Sounds like everyone is having similar experiences."
2024-02-02,Turn off the lights /s
2024-02-02,SAME!!!! But the other seal fixed it
2024-02-02,">tampon

but then you can feel free and do things like roller-blading with a poodle"
2024-02-03,"When you’re back from trying it this am, please report back!!!"
2024-02-02,Can I ask what seal you were assigned versus what seal you ended up with?
2024-09-28,Like once a month when I want to sit next to my wife but don’t want to watch what she’s watching.
2024-09-28,"It’s too much work to put on and takeoff so I usually just end up using my iPad.

Edit: I’d like to add that I have a 4 yo and a 2 yo and I need to be able to quickly drop what I’m doing to go and help them out if need be. Not very easy with the Vision Pro. I can’t just take it off and put it to the side because there is a very high chance of one of the kiddos breaking it by dropping it. So not only I should take it off but also pack it up. With the iPad I can just close the case, put it to the side and be done with it."
2024-09-28,I do not. I bought it day one and sold it back in July and haven't missed it one bit. I wished I got more value out of it but it really needed to be MacOS and not a facial iPad.
2024-09-28,"I have a pretty interesting use case for it. I’m currently learning perfumery and studying aroma chemicals and noting how they smell. Sometimes I’d have 20 different raw materials out and I find the AR is useful in helping me categorize and have info on all 20 materials at the same time. Normally I’d have 20 safari tabs open all cycling through notion and sheets. I also go into environments which helps me world build out these accords eg working with sandalwood at night in Joshua tree really puts me in the zone as I work on this Mojave moonlight vision. 

However I did buy this at launch and only recently with os2 did I finally find use for it. I’ve been living with buyers remorse til now."
2024-09-28,"I use it often as a virtual display for my Mac at work, but don’t watch as many movies and shows on it until the weather got shit in autumn. 

That’s just me though; I try not to spend too much time indoors on devices in spring and summer while it’s nice out. In winter, it’ll be a far far more frequent thing."
2024-09-28,I’m back to using it every couple of days. I think it will pick up more when the new ultra wide virtual display gets added.
2024-09-28,"Daily, almost exclusively for media. Watching movies and TV on AVP has become my favoured method but it’s very rare that I use it for anything else unfortunately. The few experiences it does have are incredible but the lack of content is massively holding it back imo. I’m no dev but from what I’ve read here from actual devs, Apple seem to be holding back a lot of useful tools and APIs and a lot of their ideas can’t be done to their full potential. If Apple don’t want to provide content for it then that’s on them but also limiting third party devs is really weak."
2024-09-28,"I use it probably average 4 days out of every week. It has replaced a lot of computer usage that would previously have been done on my laptop or PC. Watching videos, web browsing, anything I would do on my phone or PC moves into the VP."
2024-09-28,Everyday. Mostly laying in bed at night either gaming or watching movie/tv show. Sometimes while doing dishes/washing baby bottles.
2024-09-28,"I'm waiting for the amateur version to come out, so I can also not buy it."
2024-09-28,"My friend bought a Vision Pro in Canada 

Apple Store employee told him he’s the second ever to buy one from their store. 

This was 3 weeks ago 

It’s in a major city."
2024-09-28,Every day for work and entertainment.
2024-09-28,Nope. Pretty much once a month at best now. Every now and then I feel like watching something in the immersive environment.
2024-09-28,Watch something on it every night. Virtual desktop a few days a week.
2024-09-28,"I use it every day to watch videos, read news, etc."
2024-09-28,"i travel a lot for my job. ITs freaking great. its like openign a secret room and getting some privacy to clear you mind only see your just in your car at the hotel and go back to reality. i wouldn't leave the house without mine

  
Also 3d photos capture memories in a way that makes you kinda emotional. Like an emotion you've never felt bevause you know its fake but there are synapses going off in your brain saying this is real."
2024-09-28,"I bought one on launch day and returned it at the end of the return window. It was a super fun device but I don’t think I would have ended up using it a ton long term and I’d rather have that $3,500 making me more money rather than have that device sitting in its case"
2024-09-28,I use mine almost every day. Posting from mine right now!
2024-09-28,It would be really cool if VFX and CAD software ran on it. 3D data on a 2D screen is the problem that this 3D device doesn’t solve yet. I hope they make it into a useful 3D display for the Mac.
2024-09-28,"I use it often enough weekly to catch shows and watch movies, which it’s what it does best.

I have to force myself to use it for other use cases sometimes just to get use out of it.

Not worth it, not much to do with it. Price needs to be cut in half at least."
2024-09-28,I got the device in February. That was the last time I used too too 😂
2024-09-28,"Vision Pro is really just a best of class commercial prototype.  Developers will find the features best suited to their use case and find a killer app which features will filter down into Apple Vision and Apple Vision SE.

Apple have the resources to play the long game here."
2024-09-28,Only when I have someone come over who hasn’t used one yet
2024-09-28,Many times a week. It could be more but I’m not comfortable taking it into office with me.
2024-09-28,"I didn’t buy but I tried it, my thoughts are that I was expecting a faster evolution in terms of software, for example in this WWDC they barely spent time about it and even didn’t seem they are supporting Apple intelligence or at least they’re not having a clear integration despite it’s a great device for it, minimum a good demo using the new Siri in Vision Pro and using their ai capabilities in a work day would have helped."
2024-09-28,"I use mine a couple nights a week to watch tv or movies when what I want to watch is on Apple Tv+, Disney+ or Max."
2024-09-28,"Launch day owner and I use it a couple times a month, mostly to update betas and tinker with apps a bit. 

The tech is so cool and I’d totally watch immersive movies or sports on it whenever releases are more frequent. But for regular media, I have too many other options where I’m not wearing something on my face."
2024-09-28,"Every day for 3 to 4 hours. It replaces my iPad for most things, and I enjoy working on it with my Mac. It’s like having infinite iPads or iPhones around you."
2024-09-28,"I initially used it a bunch, then stopped for a while. Now I'm picking it up more again.

As others have said, it's great for movies and YouTube - though I sometimes wish that I could watch the same thing my wife is watching.

I also downloaded all of my ~150 movies to the TV app, so I can watch movies in peace and quiet on a big screen while on an airplane. That's been fun!

There are a couple of neat apps, but I haven't had time to do a full sweep of the store yet, and I think developers are still figuring out what makes sense. (For example, I wish there was a cohesive 3D map/globe feature - I looove exploring the world this way.) And until someone finds out what types of apps uniquely make sense on AVP, we'll just have to wait. But even without killer apps, I enjoy it already.

Surprises: I mostly use it stationary, just like my other devices. Walking around and placing windows contextually in different rooms hasn't become useful to me yet. But on the plus side, shopping in Safari and shopping apps (NOT 3D!) is actually amazing, because you see all the pictures much closer / in greater detail!"
2024-09-28,"I use it all the time! I love it!

-Tim"
2024-09-28,Few times a week for tv and movie watching.
2024-09-28,"Yeah of course I still use it, I knew I wanted it for movies and tv shows beforehand. And I still use it for exactly that. Not for 100% of the movies and tv shows I watch, but certain movies and tv shows do get “reserved” for the vision pro. Same with some youtube videos where the production quality is much higher. It’s great, I put my airpods pro in and the vision pro on and I can get crisp Dolby Atmos audio and a giant display easily over 140+ inches. I also sometimes scroll reddit or the news app on it too and I’ve played a couple games like Lego builder journey"
2024-09-28,"I live in Singapore. It’s wayyyy too hot to use one for extended periods of time, so I sold mine"
2024-09-28,"I use mine daily. I use it for productivity (I’m a part time researcher, writing papers in Vision Pro), for gaming (Starfield, Overwatch 2 currently) and for watching movies and for DJ mixing in Djay"
2024-09-28,"Couple times a week, solely for work, on days where I’m not swamped with meetings. Love it as a monitor replacement, but it has a long way to go for average consumer."
2024-09-28,"Still use it about 4 times a week for like 3-4 hours each. It’s great for streaming my PC into via Moonlight, and it’s my main movie/youtube/music video watching device, plus it has some games on it I still play in it. Honestly, I would use it more if it was lighter though. 4 hours is close to my limit when I start noticing the device more and more in my face. Once it starts becoming heavy and distracting, that’s when I’m usually done for the day. 

Funnily enough - I’ve found that using it during the early day allows me to feel it less for longer, but if I start using it at night, I feel it sooner. I assume it must be because at the end of a full day, your body/face is more likely to be tired overall, so the weight of the device is more amplified."
2024-09-28,I use mine regularly for media consumption.
2024-09-28,We have become ONE.
2024-09-28,"Everyday for movies and shows. Anything else I do it on it just cherry on top. I got it for multimedia to enjoy and have fun with it. I only paid about half of what it cost new at apple. I had quest 3 but it wasn’t at the quality I was fully happy with. Truly love this thing, best single tech device ever owned. Look forward to future updates with it and enjoy the ride. People get to serious with it, just relax and enjoy it."
2024-09-28,I use mine for up to 12 hours a day while working.
2024-09-28,"I use it more when traveling than at home. It's really great when traveling.

At home, it gets used for Disney+ or Apple TV+, but there hasn't been much lately that really gets me to open either of those."
2024-09-28,ppl browsing the sub still are going to skew your poll.
2024-09-28,Would consider if there’s something near the price point of the Quest… they’re great for just watching netflix/youtube on my bed.
2024-09-28,What’s funny here is reading how many people bought it thinking it was a tv and complain there’s no content 🤣🤣
2024-09-28,"I develop apps for it, so yes I use it a fair amount.

I'll also watch some shows on it."
2024-09-28,Everyday for most everything we use all our other devices for and then some
2024-09-28,Too cumbersome unless I’m intending to use it. It’s easier grabbing an iPad or another available screen. The wires are bothersome. Hopefully the next iteration uses WiFi 7 to get all the compute wireless. I’d really prefer an AR experience over what we currrntly have
2024-09-28,"I deleted many apps from my iPhone and iPad, turned around and installed those apps onto AVP.  It gives me reason to use it on the regular.  I went through all my apps and found the ones that were a better experience on AVP than touchscreens."
2024-09-28,The R&D Apple was putting into the Vision Pro should have been into AI.
2024-09-28,It’s not a product that’s going to have constant buzz six months after release.  Most people aren’t going to purchase one like most people aren’t going to purchase a MacBook Pro with the M3 Max chip.   It’s expensive and unnecessary for most people.  My guess is Apple wants to have a product in this space to plant the seed for its ecosystem but is fully prepared for it not to sell better than any other $3500 product.
2024-09-28,"I purchased on dat one and I use mine 4-5 times a week.  It’s still my goto device for watching movies / shows.

Anything more interesting than watching on my phone.  I no longer use my TV or my iPad.

There is still no other device out there like it."
2024-09-28,Tbqh… I still use mine a lot. Usually 5/7 days a week if im in town.
2024-09-28,"I bought one and was going to return it, but my little brother (25) begged me for it. I let him borrow it for a few weeks to make sure he wanted it, but I kinda forgot to follow up with him.

We hang out about once a week, and I have not seen him use it."
2024-09-28,They made a mistake by not using controllers. I’m not saying controller less is impossible but you need a way to make the virtual world seem tactile and you need a method of locomotion.
2024-09-28,Day-one user/owner. I barely use it.
2024-09-28,I wish I never bought it and that I was $4000 richer
2024-09-28,This was the dumbest product apple has released. No retail employees can even afford to buy one. Most have hardly used one and they’re expected to sell them ? And the price point insane
2024-09-29,"Returned it right before the deadline. Bought again later, and again returned it.

It’s just way way way too heavy, and expensive."
2024-09-30,Sold mine last week. It’s an extremely uncomfortable device with a beautiful screen. I regret the purchase but I knew the risk.
2024-10-01,I’m dying to sell mine
2024-10-02,"Day 1 owner here, but unfortunately I don't use it anymore. I broke it out to watch Dune 1 ahead of seeing Dune 2 in theaters, and it was awesome, but as a busy husband and father of two young children I don't really have time to be in my own little world like that all that often. It's very isolating, though my 3 year old calls me ""Daddy Robot"" when I'm wearing it. 

I almost brought it with me on the plane recently but couldn't figure out how to pair it with my non-Apple ordinary Bluetooth ear buds. 

These days I'm more interested in the Meta Orion glasses approach and am toying with getting the Meta Rayban Wayfarers for my normal prescription glasses. I was always more interested in the AR aspect and felt like the passthrough of the AVP was a little oversold. No one is like cooking in that thing routinely. Plus it's kind of heavy to wear around the house and too weird to wear outside."
2024-09-28,"Maybe 5 days a week or so. Either to watch a game, show, or movie."
2024-09-28,"Barely. It’s mostly a glorified dust collector which looks pretty.

The most annoying thing (except weight and price) is its App Store regional lock. I have services and apps already subscribed to, that I don’t want to pay again for, so…"
2024-09-28,"Wonder what OP thinks about the device, it’s hard to tell"
2024-09-28,"Yes every day.  This is very unlike the Quest which after a few games was done for good.  The AVP is just so much more useful.

A lot more than ""11"" of us bought and use them... try a few hundred thousand and growing."
2024-09-28,"I was considering to invest in one after trying it in a demo at the Apple Store. But could I do my work as a sound designer with it? Can it be like a Mac by itself or it's just for entertainments, emails, and alt?"
2024-09-28,"Not seeing a lot of verified users replying.

I use mine 2-3 times a week."
2024-09-28,We bought a couple to make apps. We made 1 hasnt really sold. Working on a second. Hoping it will do better
2024-09-28,Never buy first gen
2024-09-28,"Every day, one of the best products Apple have ever made"
2024-09-28,Wonder if Apples Vision Pro team is freaking out by Metas Orion.
2024-09-28,"Pretty sure there’s people who bought it without knowing what they would use it for and expected Apple to tell them lol

But, if you understand that it’s just like any other computing device, then it becomes a matter of what do you use technology for.

I use technology for work, gaming, reading, learning, social and entertainment, so any device I use it’s used for those things daily.

I use the Vision Pro every day for more than 6 hours, if I’m home it’s my primary device and it replaced my iPhone and iPad.

Most of the negativity on this tech comes from people having literally nothing to do in it, just like on any other device, perhaps scrolling socials as the most devices, and if you have a phone, that’s enough for that, I wouldn’t even recommend you get an iPad or a pc if that’s all you do.

If you use technology a lot, then the Vision Pro is just a better experience than any phone or tablets for most use cases but making actual phone calls (not a phone, but you can use facetime).

I made a post if you want to know what I do in it, but a part from 4k movies and 100inch gaming screen, the rest is unsurprising cause it’s the apps you’d expect people to use every day, which is exactly what people normally do… https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/s/V7LDZcQjf4"
2024-09-28,"Every few days. It’s too heavy for long time productivity use. I bought it as a device to explore visionOS development and watch stuff. It’s the best way to enjoy a movie (with AirPods) for me, but I definitely want to put it away after 1-2 hours."
2024-09-28,The real question is: **How many of you use it outside?**
2024-09-28,"Wife bought me one for anniversary present and I use it pretty often. It’s great for plowing through emails, news, video etc"
2024-09-28,"Ironically, I work from home and use it more when I go in the office.  

At home I have multi monitor but at the officer there are small visitor cubbies.  So turn the wall that makes me feel claustrophobic into the beach the so open space off to the left, work in reality center and watch for people needing me on the right (with floating windows)"
2024-09-28,"I don’t have one, but I had many VR headsets in the past, which I never used for long. Consequently I didn’t buy the AVP. But if it would run Mac Applications and had full support for keyboard and touchpad, then I would buy one tomorrow."
2024-09-28,Once every few weeks to watch something alone. I also bring it on long flights but it’s so clunky.
2024-09-28,"I use it when I travel, not really otherwise."
2024-09-28,"I use mine about 2 or 3 times a week, usually to watch movies and tv shows. I live alone, so it is a much nicer visual experience for me rather than using my tv. Just wish I could get a better audio experience than AirPods Pro when using it.

One unexpected thing with using it to watch content is that I’m much more engaged with watching the movie/show because it eliminates distractions (can’t really multitask in the cinema environment)."
2024-09-28,"Yeah, I just watch YouTube videos and TV/Movies on it, sometimes I'll use it for screen mirroring. Taking 3D photos and videos is kinda fun too.


I mainly bought it because it works really well as a personal theater. I also have a Q3 which I bought before the AVP and used while traveling, so having that content consumption experience with higher quality displays and without the hassle of controllers is pretty nice."
2024-09-28,I have not used mine since May. I bought a few for my office and a personal one with 1 TB. Definitely a mistake lol.
2024-09-28,"Honestly, hardly ever. Watching movies in the most compelling thing, and my home theater is better than the AVP. It’s a fun novelty machine. Honestly I think the entire product category is flawed and needs to transition to something like Metas Orion."
2024-09-28,"Almost daily - I use it as a virtual monitor for my MBP whenever I’m anywhere that’s not my office desk, and it’s my default TV for movies/shows/youtube. This usually means it’s used in my bed 90% of the time and I go from my MBP at night over to streaming Plex at Mt Hood all while being cozy. 

Also flying with it has been a godsend."
2024-09-28,"I use it daily. Mac Virtual Display is the killer app, in my experience"
2024-09-28,"I would like one once there are more compelling apps.  I suspect the initial one is for developers and social media to build the infrastructure. 

But for me AR is more important.  I have the Rayband Metas which are good but need the visual side of AR to be better"
2024-09-28,"I travel a lot and use it constantly when flying, in hotels etc. I haven't used inflight entertainment or turned on a hotel TV since I got it."
2024-09-28,This should have been a poll.  Would have liked to see some stats
2024-09-28,once every month or 2 for watching movies. IT doesn''t have night shift so kills my sleep if I watch it before bed on weekdays. This leaves the weekends but I rarely want to watch movies / tv then. That's more of an unwind activity after working all day
2024-09-28,"I still use it from time to time, and it’s a great piece of tech, but I do have some regrets on spending money on it."
2024-09-28,"Watching things! Definitely the best form of media consumption I’ve ever used. But beyond that, not much."
2024-09-28,In my world only folks born in or falling in to excess wealth could spend that much money on entertainment for themselves. Kudos to y’all.
2024-09-28,Once a week at most
2024-09-28,"I use mine on the daily in place of an iPad. At home I use it for browsing, computer work, movie watching, etc…. 

I also travel a lot for work and this has been one of the best devices I’ve ever bought for that reason alone. I use it on flights for entertainment, in my hotel room for work and entertainment, etc…

I had a brief moment where I thought I would sell it about a month after launch, but I sort of “forced” myself to use it more and I’m glad I did.

I’d buy it all over again."
2024-09-28,I regret not returning mine. I never use it.
2024-09-28,"I love it, but after putting it on, there’s just not much to do in it."
2024-09-28,"I defo had more faith in Apple. But after flying to NYC, I couldn’t say no after the demo."
2024-09-28,I’ve owned it since the day it was released and I’ve used it almost every day since. Im a big movie buff and typically watch a movie every night. Now I do it on the AVP while laying down in my bed. It’s just incredible as a personal theater.
2024-09-28,"I used to be a big VR influencer now my quests are at my nephews house collecting dust; I promoted the AVP for work, but honestly never spent more than 10 minutes in it"
2024-09-28,I had this thing for 48 hours and I would have kept it….if we could have had profiles. The lack of profiles was really the dealbreaker for me at that price point.
2024-09-28,It's hot in Canada
2024-09-28,A few times a week typically
2024-09-28,I mirror my iPhone games directly to it and then use a controller. It’s a pretty good experience for light gaming.
2024-09-28,"Every couple days, yes, usually when I just want to enjoy some video content. I really wish there were more immersive content out there and easily accessible. That’s the killer app, content, rather than apps like an iPhone needs. 

People keep trying to box it into the iPhone or Mac world by saying it needs apps, and it really doesn’t fit there. *It’s an iPod for immersive content.*

I find it hard to work in. Comfort is a factor, sure, but there’s something else really weird about Vision Pro that nobody seems to talk about: the sleepiness factor.

For some reason, I can only use mine for an hour at a time before I get really tired and find myself closing my eyes. Not sure what it is, maybe relaxed posture, maybe the darkness around my periphery, maybe it correlates to the time of day I’m using it, or maybe it’s the fans slowly drying out my eyes. But when I take them off and go do something else, even just watching the same content at my computer desk, the feeling goes away."
2024-09-28,"I’ve used it almost daily since it got it (about one month after launch for my birthday). I finished my online degree using it (information systems), and am using it regularly for my new/2nd/remote job (data annotation/AI Tutoring). My main use case is virtual display from my Mac, but it’s nice to have my work flow on the virtual display and then have work slack open in the AVP floating next to the virtual display. I will add that working remote is even sweeter when you can do if from the sands of bora bora…

When I’m not using it for work, I use mostly to consume movies, tv, YouTube, or browse the web. Especially at night laying on bed. My wife is light sensitive so having it on doesn’t bother her like being on my phone or iPad does. I’ve also found that a solid use case is while on the couch, if I want to watch something, say like a sporting event, and my wife wants to watch one of her true crime shows… she can have the tv and I can use the direct tv app in the Vision Pro to each watch what we want but still be able to cuddle on the couch with each other. Not something I’d recommend doing all the time, but comes in handy on say Sunday where I can watch nfl red zone and she can watch whatever (pro tip: position the AVP window just off of the tv and the pass through is good enough that I can at least stay engaged enough that I can keep up with what she is watching too."
2024-09-28,"I only use mine about once a month, if that, but I don’t regret buying it at all. I love the technology. By the way, I just got the new iPhone 16 Pro Max when it came out and took a ton of spatial videos and panoramic photos while on vacation. Can’t wait to view them on my Vision Pro!"
2024-09-28,It’s crazy I was in the Apple Store the other day and there’s was still 6 people doing the user experience.
2024-09-28,I haven’t used it in about a month. I should have known better to buy one. Got the quest 2 used it for about a week and it’s been in the box ever since.
2024-09-28,Nah
2024-09-28,"I wish you could explore realistic historic sites with it, to see what life looked back then in detail and around you. Super immersive"
2024-09-28,"I don’t own a VP but the same reasons I stop using my Quest 2 are mirrored here and I think is just a hurdle for this tech in general. It’s just a little bit of a hassle to put on adjust, wait for updates , adjust again because I got an itch on my nose etc. It’s fine when I have a new game or something I really want to play but it’s a not a casual device for me to use. I’m burnt out on VR in general but if it was easier to jump into id use it more often."
2024-09-28,"I use it occasionally solely for the purpose of viewing spatial photos and videos, especially after the visionOS 2 update where you can convert a 2D image to spatial. Use it quite a lot to review my past life, and those family members I haven’t been able to see again."
2024-09-28,"Frankly I feel this is another iPad type of thing. Back in 2010-2012 you didn’t really need an iPad, when those awful netbooks and the like were still very much all the rage. 

In the last twelve or so years that’s definitely changed, especially as Apple’s competition evolved in the existing markets. Nowadays, an iPad serves as a useful tool for minor productivity. Nothing more, nothing less. 

From this I can foresee a similar effect happening with the VisionPro. Maybe not for the same uses, at least from what I understand, but for many other reasons."
2024-09-28,"It’s a very neat gadget with interesting prospects, but no, I don’t regularly use it. Once every few days or so when I get some free time. Mostly it’s too isolating from my wife and daughters.

I bought it for $1800 used. So at that price, well worth trying. At retail? Yeah. No."
2024-09-29,"Daily, for when coding on the laptop, watching tv shows and movies in the evenings, while doing jobs around the house or hanging out in environments. Took a nap with it on today listening to a podcast while hanging out in white sands.

I’ve had it for 2 months and am very comfortable with using it with just the solo strap now. Took a while to get used to it."
2024-09-29,"I own lots of $AAPL stock. Feel it’s my obligation to own and use the Vision Pro. 
While it’s not a daily device. 3D movie experience is unmatched. I wish they offer more 8K 360 films."
2024-09-29,"When I suggested the Vision Pro would not be a mass market success until it was smaller like a pair of sunglasses, I was met with lots of hate from Apple fan boys. I wonder if those same fanboys defend it vehemently today still? It was/is a great idea, that has exponential potential but not in its current form. I suspect it’s 10-15 years away before it’s ready to be widely adopted by consumers (and that’s with the assumption it’s small and convenient to carry around), but will Apple abandon it before then is the real question. Apple typically are pretty quick to abandon a product that doesn’t make them big dollars. 

On the other hand, I am going to buy a Vision Pro when they are clearing them out and keep it sealed in box to sell in 20 years time…that’s where this generations real value is - The collector market."
2024-09-29,"Still think that, once they make this tech into something than looks like regular glasses, you’ll see everyone wearing them……..until then? Just a novelty, the same way computers were before the Internet."
2024-09-29,"I went and tried one out in an Apple Store and was super impressed compared to other headsets, but when it starts at AU$6000 and can’t be a laptop replacement I’m not sure who’s buying this honestly… 

At the demo they weren’t trying to push a sale at all and were purely focussed on just showing it off - it really seems like Apple just wants to get the idea of this kind of device into people’s heads before they release something more reasonable."
2024-09-29,"I probably use it about once a month to check if there are any interesting new apps. The thing it does best is display movies, but if I'm going to sit down and watch a movie, I don't do it alone.



 I told myself I'd try my hand at AR app development, but just haven't been motivated. Most of the concepts I had in mind would require access to the raw camera data. (and even if I had that access, it would take a lot more time than I have available at the moment)"
2024-09-29,I got mine off of Facebook Marketplace for 1000 off. It has it’s uses and I try to use it at least weekly
2024-09-29,"Still use it most days for watching a film and web browsing. Tried working with it and just wasn’t for me, still too much friction compared to a real world set up"
2024-09-29,"Almost every day, instead of sitting and watching YouTube or tv/movies/news on any other device I probably sit for 30-45 minutes and use it instead."
2024-09-29,"Mainly use mine as portable TV for quick spinning sessions everyday. My bike trainer is basically in a small closet with no space to mount a TV. It is however too big and bulky for longer spinning sessions and it get extremely sweaty.

I also do some thermal hunting for pest control/monitoring weekly. I use my Apple Vision to see through the thermal scope, which makes camping out a lot more relaxed. I do wish there is a way allow a window to move with you instead of being pinned to a physical space.

I also watch 3D movies through my AVP maybe once a month."
2024-09-29,"Maybe 2-3 times a week. Usually in the evening for content consumption.

I used to work with it during the day but there are so many stupid little quality of life issues that make it just annoying. First it was the lack of mouse support (now resolved, thankfully), but now it’s the inability to keep the damn thing on when I want to rest my eyes for 5 minutes or go to the bathroom. You can’t take this thing off your face at all without everything going to sleep, so my extended desktop has to be reconnected and apps refreshed, etc. it’s seriously stupid. Just give me a setting that lets me keep it awake but locked when it’s off my face.

I think apple had much bigger plans for this but they were caught with their pants down on AI adoption, so this got the back burner while everything went towards apple intelligence. It sucks, but I understand it. I could probably sell it and be ok but I would occasionally miss it."
2024-09-29,I use it pretty much daily. I forgot my luggage in a coworkers car Friday and won’t have it back until Wednesday. I miss it a lot and really missed it on the plane!
2024-09-29,"Daily, for hours. When you pair it with a mac it's amazing for productivity ""stuff."""
2024-09-29,"It is unexpectedly a great device to help me to focus. Floating macOS in a virtual environment still feels super cool, and because of the friction of having to remove the headset to look at my phone, it has helped curb distractions and keep me on task.

Downside: my M1 MacBook Air lags a bit when mirroring to the Vision Pro while working in Figma. (Only happens when a Figma is open, the larger my Figma window is the worse the lag.) My solution is to reduce the window size or drop the macOS screen to 1080p. I will be upgrading to the M4 MacBook Pro whenever it comes out to reduce the delay."
2024-09-30,"I use it everyday, as a nice closet ornament"
2024-09-30,Just watched the last two episodes of industry and my brother often uses it to watch movies also.
2024-09-30,Nope
2024-09-30,"A post like this happens like every week, “Apple Vision Pro owners after a month do you use your device”…. 

To answer all the previous and all the upcoming questions exactly like this: 

Owner since launch, I use it when I need it, the same way I use my iPad or my drone for that fact. My main use is when I want a change, from  my desk or usual areas of work and would like to go anywhere in the house and finish what I am doing , yes an iPad would allow me for that but not in the way the AVP does, for video I am a plex user and there are apps to live convert content into 3D so for me that is one of the bests uses I got from it.

Money worth? Yes.

In 7,8,9,10 months my answer will still be good.

For reference the device I use the most is my kindle scribe."
2024-09-30,I'd like to thank everyone for pioneering this new tech and helping support the development of future apps that I will purchase once Vision Pro V3 comes out!
2024-10-02,"I use it for work 1 to 8 hours a day, and now that the dark tracking is so on point, since wife goes to bed earlier then me and prefers to have me go to bed with her, I lay in the pitch black and read books. Or watch a show. probably 5-6x a week. 

A bit worried I’m going to get brain cancer."
2024-10-02,"I use mine about 6 hours a day for work. Now that Microsoft upgraded Remote Desktop, I no longer need to use my MacBook Pro for display."
2024-10-02,"Pretty sure the tech in the device will be diluted into other products once it finds a solid use case. The tech has serious merit, just no real use cases."
2024-10-04,"Not regularly, but I do watch movies or TV shows on it sometimes. Especially great for long trips.

I’d use it way more often (probably every day) if it were lighter and more comfortable."
2024-10-18,"The accurate metric to answer the question is that nobody talks about it.  So no matter how much people in denial might claim it’s useful to them personally, most of them are lying and this product was a waste of carbon emissions.  It does almost nothing that a convenient flat 2D screen can’t do, and even for its tiny niche of uses it’s impractical.

Another way to understand the product being a pointless failure is: people pretend to be interested in things (“3D nature videos!”) that they don’t care about on a highly effective 2D screen.  Therefore you know they’re never going to do that."
2024-11-17,I use it some. But have never used it much. I bought it cause I believe it will be fantastic. Technology just gets better and better. I’m believing it can grow with AI. Will wait and see
2024-12-11,It’s one of the coolest things ever if you don’t have to worry about anything else like kids or time
2025-01-04,"I have my niche use case and that increase the total time spent using it substantially.  
Nowadays I use it during 3 days a week, for 8 hours plus on each of those days.  
I achieve this by either being plugged in, or having my ugreen nexode power bank 20k mha, 100w.

1. I don't like mixing work with personal life, as someone who still carries work laptop, work laptop  
but miss being able to access at glance my personal stuff usually meant carry double everything  
to have my music, documents, code, etc.

Nowadays allow screen mirroring in the same wifi network, and just share the work screen into AVP  
but all the surrounding windows are AVP windows and thus there is no data cross contamination.

2. I am quite picky on maintaining a portable workflow, thus when doing something I always prefer to work on the MacBook screen and only at best have reference content on the larger displays, this way, my workflow habits are always with me, window navigation etc. This for me can easily become a productivity killer hence why I opted for this. Similarly I had quite often struggled in moving between keyboards, same reason... and thus I used to religiously solely use laptop keyboard.

AVP allowed me to finally get the MacBook out of the center of the desk, I can reliably have a big display with me in a portable fashion. This was a game change for me. The now minimalist desk, is giving second thoughts to the monitors I have. 

This has already helped me do my soldering, and 3d print projects much better as space is less of an issue (I live in an apartment).

3. Finally some real 3D apps have been showing, with real promising, I started doing piano ""lessons"" on my keyboard, and there is an app Simply Piano which detects your keyboard and overlays the virtual keyboard on top of your keys. this is precisely what I expected from Mixed/Augmented Reality.

I also found that the djay is fun, incorporated with Apple Music, the controls are surprisingly precise despite lacking physical feedback.

4. Flying combined with AirPods Max is ultra delight. Perfect to feel less confined.

Things that are definitely not there yet for my intended use case:  
  
1. Text from Real World, id like it to be more interactive. I saw news about Visual Search, seems like there isn't such thing in EU. Having to resort at taking a screenshot then going to photos.

2. Text in real world that is not coming from a screen and is small is terrible to read. You need super bright lights to have a chance, despite the iPhone camera doing it just fine.

At the moment my workaround is screen mirror the iPhone to AVP and point it to whatever I need, if I will be needing it for extended period of time.  
  
3. Navigating outside, or even indoors, no ability to pin an APP to follow oneself is annoying to say the least, some data is relevant to be overlayed at all times, this for me would be a killer feature. While working, on a 3d Print, assembling something, this would be fantastic, to be able to have those references just there at the corner of my eye with adjustable transparency.

4. Flying is great, but content to be downloaded to AVP requires the AVP to be on. On a flight, it is still better to just use pre-downloaded content, and this means using the AVP for the duration of the download. There is no way to AirPlay the content from the phone, or allow it to read the data from the iPhone, nor turn on AVP without being on the face and instructing it to download.

5. App Availability is definitely low, but I think there is quite a bit of potential here. Posture, Health related, augmentation of other apple products, all these visual cues that can enrich the real world are still missing, and they should feel like ""plugins to the vision"" rather than apps."
2025-01-05,There is a bug with mine that makes controllers convey input as mice which ruined remoting and playing steam games for me!
2025-03-13,I use mine daily. Mostly for spatial content and other movies and videos.
2024-09-28,"Vision pro aged very bad, I’ve got the chance to try it. Still can’t get how a company like Apple thought that was a good and usable product"
2024-09-28,I saw a family in the Apple Store last weekend when I was returning an iPhone. They were buying three sets. One for each adult and one for what seemed to be a 16ish year old girl. I was having a very hard time figuring out what the 16 year old’s use case would be other than “look at this expensive thing my family got me.”
2024-09-28,"Nope. Rarely used it, maybe once a few months too much hassle to just wear it."
2024-09-28,"I used it for about 30-45 minutes at an Apple Store after a quick demo as I was waiting for someone. 

It was ok and the tech was seriously impressive, especially viewing those Live Photos. But by the end I wanted it off my head, I just do not want something on my face like that."
2024-09-28,"None, waste of money"
2024-09-28,"AR>VR. I want to add to my world, not be ensnared in a lesser one."
2024-09-28,It’s an overpriced PoS.
2024-09-28,Barely twice a month or so. So not worth it
2024-09-29,"I think it had to do with the price point, if they had offered it at Oculus, Meta Quest prices they would have took off….but Apple kinda fumbled this with the 3.5k price point. And then there was the quality issues…."
2024-09-28,"I saw someone using it on a Frontier flight, which doesn't come with any IFE.

But apart from flights, I don't see many real-life use cases"
2024-09-28,"You’ve tried posting  this 4 times. Dude, get a life"
2024-09-28,"If they can figure out how to cater to glasses wearers, without insert lenses, then I’ll be there. That’s the stumbling block for me, and I’m guessing more would-be users."
2024-09-28,Do people really pay 3.5k for a device and not use it after a couple of months? You guys really need to read up about electronic junk and care more about the environment not to mention maybe think about smart spending. EDIT I like how I'm being down voted for pointing out some people should spend money smarter and care more about the planet. Consumerism at its finest
2024-09-28,"Once Apples makes the Vision Pro with a cellular function, then I’ll considered getting one."
2024-09-28,"> the buzz has completely died down. No more press, no more YouTube videos, no more publicity for Apple Vision Pro.

So, the same as every other headset then? I see none of this for any of them. This isn't a defence of the AVP, it's just what I see. These devices aren't things for the masses."
2024-09-28,It makes a good paper weight 😃
2024-09-29,"I forgot the article I had read loke 9 months ago but it seemed a lot of people basically just bought it tried it out and returned them. Knwoingthe high cost unless it was mindbkowing always intended to return them; Especially, when it seemed like every tik tok person had one. Well yea made their vid and returned them. 

My buddy who woke slucrerice job oil field and still has his lol just in his closet didn't like how they felt after a while. It's cool tech and definitely not made for average Joes bank account or lifestyle. If more people could afford it and Be apart of it kind of like how iPhone fisnly blew uoannd iMessage j can see it being cool"
2024-09-28,It was always TOO immersive IMO. Never owned one but that was my initial reaction. I forgot these existed until now lol.
2024-09-28,Clowns
2024-09-28,Jealous spam for a loser who can’t afford it
2024-09-28,Do you feel like you got your money's worth out of it?
2024-09-28,"I sold mine. Loved the tech, but man it is heavy. My wife called it a waste of money and I kind of agree at this point. It was overly expensive and limited in functionality. Feel like I was beta testing the real product coming in 1-3 years."
2024-09-28,That sounds romantic .
2024-09-30,You mean porn right ;)
2024-09-29,You sit next to your wife once a month?
2024-09-30,"> Like once a month when I want to sit next to my wife but don’t want to watch what she’s watching.

I sold mine when I started doing weekly

- 1hr yoga
- 8hrs crossfit
- 14hrs pickleball

Doesn't help I sleep before 10pm & wake after 6am.

Working hours are 8am-5pm.

My RHR dropped from ~100bpm to <60bpm with a target of >40bpm.

Replacing my 6yo AW S4 with S10 this week to better record my fitness journey! Woohoo!"
2024-09-28,"Thanks for the perspective 

As a busy adult, the main benefit I can see from it is consuming media and sports while I work around the house. Haven’t a virtual TV floating around while I wash dishes, vacuum, etc would be awesome"
2024-09-28,"1000% this.    It feels like a 5 min ordeal getting the thing ready to use.   From powering it on, to adjusting the fit, placing it somewhere on the person, running the cable behind my hoodie, making sure tracking works well."
2024-09-28,"I used to think that would be the case, but for the experience being waaaay better than the iPad, I find it easy enough to justify it. Especially if you have long sessions, I love not having to hold an iPad in my hands while laying on my couch, it’s such an uncomfortable thing for an 11” screen.

My arms and eyes actually prefer to rest, which they can’t properly do with the iPad. Compared to a TV, of course the TV is probably easier, but then again, you can do more things in it, and the TV doesn’t zone you out if you want to be immersed.

Maybe they figure out a way to make it even better in time, who knows!"
2024-09-28,You can watch TV+ show with mountain scene on iPad tho!
2024-09-28,"This was my entire argument against it and people were saying Im just being an Apple hater. This is what makes the Meta Orion much more appealing (except the frame is hideous). A pair of glasses with AR is  easy to put on and very light, the only concern is battery life and cost. Apple should be focusing on that form factor and not the Vision pro."
2024-09-28,"While I can’t say your wrong in your opinion, I literally timed how long it took for my to put it on vs how long to take my iPad out of a sling and begin using it. The difference was seconds. I’m not bothered by that small bit of time for something I feel is drastically superior."
2024-09-28,How do you mount that to your face?
2024-09-29,"Similar situation here is why I didn’t bother with it. Device seemed like it would be amazing, if and only if I was available for extended sessions."
2024-09-28,"This 100%. At the very least it needs to be more open. For what is basically an enthusiast only device, you can’t force the same restrictions as a mainstream iPhone. I mean, you can, but you are seeing now what happens. 

Either it needs to seriously slim down (features, cost, weight) to have more widespread appeal, or it needs to fully cater to enthusiasts by allowing the same freedoms of macOS."
2024-09-28,Vision Pro running macOS with mouse support would be killer.
2024-09-28,If they make Vision Pro more like MacOS Apple can’t get its 30% tax on every purchase you make through it.
2024-09-28,Bingo
2024-09-28,Agree. Using it as a screen was so clunky. Limiting our number of screens made it useless for me because I could just use the standard screen.
2024-09-28,Oh can’t you use it as a display for your Mac OS laptop or computer though? So you can have access to Mac OS that way? Or not? (Not an owner of VP yet).
2024-09-28,"I was drooling over it from the announcement in June of 23 until a few days before it went on sale when all the first reviews started to come out.

It hadn’t even occurred to me that it wouldn’t just be a Mac with pass through instead of a wallpaper.

I would never pay more than the price a Mac Mini for something that (despite being much cooler) is much less useful."
2024-09-28,This is what I was thinking. Apple gimped the OS. The OS needed full MacOS treatment in order for people to use it due to the form factor.
2024-09-28,This was not on my list of top 3000 use cases for the AVP and yet it makes so much sense
2024-09-28,"Unrelated but have you read the book Perfume? Most amazing portrayal of scent, it may be very interesting to you…"
2024-09-28,Grats on getting OS/2 running on it
2024-09-28,I ain’t paying a dollar until they add MULTIIPLE virtual desktops of Mac. Just streaming Mac’s display? Come on Tim Apple. Is that a joke? Add some complexity so I can boost my productivity
2024-09-28,How does it work as a virtual display for Mac from your experience? Any complaints? Is it possible to sit for hours in it for work or do you get fatigued quickly? All apps work fine?
2024-09-28,"I haven't got one, but that would be my primary use for it if I did. How does it compare to a traditional screen for this?"
2024-09-28,Being able to make virtual tours of real estate would be incredible. Don’t know how it doesn’t work with matterport by now
2024-09-28,"Apple going full Apple Watch on the Vision Pro. There are barely apps for Apple Watch and still no custom watch faces. On a watch that’s not a huge issue, because you use it only a few seconds at a time. But on the Vision Pro it’s of course essential to gain more app support."
2024-09-28,Reminds me of when the iPhone first released without the AppStore.
2024-09-30,No head or neck ache?
2024-09-28,What gaming? But for real… as I know few Apple Arcade titles are available for it and that’s it.
2024-09-28,"I wish it was more Mac, but if they’re going to make it more iPad they need to get the cost down. I mained an iPad for years as my laptop, I got by fine. All I do for work is text documents and slideshows so it did the job, but even then that’s a $1000 device after Magic Keyboard and Pencil (and even that is outrageous for what it is.) 

I’m down for what is essentially an iPad on my eyes. I am. I really want the thing just to watch movies truth be told. but at $3500 I’m expecting Mac level performance and I just cannot stomach it. get it to $1500~ and I’ll *consider* it and even that is a huge maybe. at $500~ I’d hop in with no hesitation. 

I’ve got a Quest 2 and it’s such a gimmicky device that I’m just not sold enough on VR."
2024-09-28,"Vision SE: less glass, more aluminum, and more affordable."
2024-09-28,What kind of entertainment
2024-09-28,You can do Bridge Runs on a Vision Pro?
2024-09-28,Do you really mean VR porn?
2024-09-28,I simply don't believe you.
2024-09-28,"I get genuinely curious about these types of experiences. I had the same issue with the iPad, turned out I simply didn’t need it when I bought it.

Now I’m more home I use it mire. What was your use case for the vision pro? Why did you decide to buy it?"
2024-09-28,"I, too watch “something” on it almost every night."
2024-09-29,"I usually use three monitors for work in my home office. It’s mostly spreadsheets, slack, marketing programs, lots of internet tabs, nothing super intense or anything. 

However, I also travel a lot and then I’m stuck with my single 16” screen. 

How good is Vision Pro at replacing a few monitors?"
2024-09-29,Which apps do you use?
2024-09-28,"iPad 1 did actually have a keyboard Apple sold.

It was basically a Magic Keyboard that had a 30-pin the iPad could be docked to vertically"
2024-09-28,Yeah especially given it’s not accessible to most people. $3500 isn’t something people can easily shell out money for. Especially for a first gen product
2024-09-28,"How much ridicule they often get for new products and then how often they are portrayed as boring. I must say they are playing quite well in a few spaces. Apple silicon is nothing short of amazing. I’m also rather surprised how AirPods could get such a large market share in wireless earbuds. 

Apple Watch 1 also got such a review, what do you use it for? And then year over year they tweaked it.

So I am also rooting for this product category to get more movement beyond a select group of gamers."
2024-09-28,"Apple has put a lot of effort into making their products smaller over the years. They will eventually get these small and cheap enough for widespread use. 

High-rez AR sunglasses will be hard to deny. But it’s gonna take a while to get there. 

Phones are going to seem so awkward to future generations. “You had to hold it in your hand? How did you even see that tiny screen?”"
2024-09-28,"Yeah, they've always had a ""first generation sucks"" problem.  They're very good at iterating into the proper use case though."
2024-09-28,"The idea of having to put something on my head in n order to do that still seems rather off putting and foreign to me. Until it comes as a pair of smart glasses that is, since I wear normal glasses already."
2024-09-28,Apple marketing would like to get this testimonial for the the next presentation of Tim.
2024-09-28,Can this be covered by my mental health insurance
2024-09-28,"When I did my demo I thought that if I would have kids, I would buy one in a heartbeat because of how immersive home videos can be captured and viewed. 

I don’t have a kid so I’m waiting for future versions where the process point is lower, lol!"
2024-09-28,"I can’t imagine lugging around that giant case, in addition to everything I have. Things is like a full carryon."
2024-09-28,Nice try Apple PR plant
2024-10-02,"How are you capturing the photos/videos? As the father of a 1yo and 3yo, this was a major reason for me getting the AVP but I've been pretty underwhelmed tbh. I've been more impressed with the ""full screen"" video capture, but it's a little grainy and always warns me about motion sickness when I activate it, so I might be capturing wrong somehow."
2024-09-28,"Same, got the excitement out of my system and kept my $3,500. Will definitely be interested in future iterations though."
2024-09-28,Based on your experience what would you think the price point should be for it?
2024-09-28,So how is that 3500 making you more money now?
2024-09-28,Is this a joke? No way someone browses Reddit in VR
2024-09-28,Used they’re often around $2000. That’s a fair price for what it is. I bought in at $1800. I feel like it’s worth $1500. Certainly not $3800 retail.
2024-09-28,Well You be ridiculed?
2024-09-28,"What type of sports can you watch on it that makes it immersive? I see the quest has NBA Courtside for example, does AVP offer something like this or?"
2024-09-29,Curious. Can’t you do SharePlay with the Apple Vision Pro and one of her devices? Maybe even the Apple TV? I was thinking about doing this if I got one.
2024-09-28,"Unbelievable, how do you support you head? Isn’t this thing super heavy"
2024-09-28,Does it have a YouTube TV app?
2024-09-28,Released any apps yet?
2024-09-28,Or siri
2024-09-28,"It’s like an iPad, but the added advantage is you can use your mac with it as a screen.

Consider it like a better iPad (4k oled, massive flexibility on multi tasking and screen sizes), but with the ability to extend other devices for that added visual quality and flexibility. I use it on its own or as a screen for my mac, ps5 and gaming pc.

Multi tasking means, I can keep work apps like mail, calendar and zoom or reminder aside and at a glance, while keeping the main window in front of me focused on what I’m doing on my pc."
2024-09-28,How much development for the app did you do before getting it?
2024-09-28,"There is hardly a userbase, not sure what one can hope for in terms of sales…"
2024-09-28,No need to be so sensitive. It’s a fair question.
2024-09-28,"Why would they be freaked out about a prototype that isn’t coming to market like this?

I think people forget that Meta show A LOT of things off early. Apple don’t show it till it’s almost available. 

You can’t infer the state of Apple internally the same way."
2024-09-28,"Zuckerberg was saying there will be many headset form factors for the various use cases. This is just saying there doesn’t exist a single set of technologies to build a single device to cover every use case. Meta was saying they will likely partner with hardware companies to build more niche headsets.

Unless Apple can drastically reduce price, AVP is at risk of being a large failure (not enough buyers at $3500 plus tax)."
2024-09-28,Orion is the new AR glasses?  Those are a prototype with no announced date for being turned into a product.  I'm sure they are paying attention to their competitors but they can't be too worried.
2024-09-28,This is a weird take. I’d bet 100k that Apple has glasses just like Orion in their labs
2024-09-28,"Spa experience vs. Barber

Totally different experiences.  I'm very excited about Orion, but moreso for all-day activities.  The AVP is something I'd wear if I'm doing hardcore work, or want to escape into my own ""headspace""."
2024-09-28,"I think they took one look and laughed and laughed.

Not only is it the most butt ugly pair of glasses ever developed by humanity, but it's only a concept vision of what someday they might make.  Like in five years...

Meanwhile Apple is shipping and iterating."
2024-10-27,"I was in line at Apple Store few weeks ago to try it but couldn’t due to closing time. I remember a person finished their demo and discussing with Apple employee  that this is great tech like 5-7 years ago. Now we are moving to eye wear devices like glasses etc. I have the quest 3 and like it for the many games, 3d content etc and community that is supporting it. But noticing a switch to smaller eyewear glasses."
2024-09-29,And no usecase aside from movies.
2024-09-28,"I’m most excited about the AR functionality. 

I want to cook with it. Have my timers floating somewhere. A conversion calculator floating there.  Have the recipe floating over there and checking off the ingredients as I go. Can even have a show on somewhere else that I can tune into during lulls"
2024-09-28,Honestly I can tell you as an AVP owner and former owner of two more traditional VR headset that you definitely want the prescription lenses to be part of the headset and not a headset that fits over your glasses.
2024-09-28,"After all of these years, Apple still can’t figure out how to get cellular connectivity built in to the MacBook Pro.  They are in no rush to give cellular connectivity to Vision Pro."
2024-09-28,"That’s a terrible idea, it does not need its connection, in fact it doesn’t need to be its own computer, I don’t know why it doesn’t just connect to the iPhone"
2024-09-28,"Quest 3 alone sold over 1,000,000 units. When the price is right augmented reality devices sell very well."
2024-09-28,"No judging, so you spent 3k+ on something to watch YouTube?"
2024-09-28,Nope.
2024-09-28,Of the wife or the Vision Pro?
2024-09-28,Even if someone is using it 24 hours a day.. 365 days a year they won’t get the moneys worth with this thing. It’s outrageous.
2024-09-28,"Absolutely not, no"
2024-09-28,The wife or the Vision Pro?
2024-09-28,Get a quest 3 for $500 if you want your money's worth.
2024-09-28,"I mean, does that _sound_ like it?"
2024-09-28,It’s great. She can watch some Korean drama show she’s into and I’ll just overlay the TV with hockey or something.
2024-09-29,I also sit next to this guys wife!
2024-09-28,"> while I work around the house.    

I own a similar headset, that weighs a little less, and I'd find the almost 650 grams hanging from my head/neck cumbersome while trying to get stuff done. For laying/sitting and light exercise, it is alright, but I cannot imagine trying to do household chores with that boat anchor on me.   

I feel like people who haven't own a VR headset let their imagination run wild with the possibilities. Nobody who owns one does those things for a very good reason. If the weight/bulk was substantially reduced, then maybe, but that isn't today's tech by any brand."
2024-09-28,"That sounds like hell.

Disconnecting feels so much better."
2024-09-28,Long commutes as well
2024-09-28,"Nice try, Apple."
2024-09-28,You must have really buff neck muscles lugging around that brick on your face.
2024-09-28,Why not have a case that can hold the ipad?
2024-09-28,"The AVP is actually going to be worse for your eyes, at least according to two optometrists I’ve spoken to about it."
2024-09-28,Hello Tim Apple.
2024-09-28,Takeoff is the name of a popular rapper who passed away in 2022.
2024-09-28,"There was a moment where I had the beta of Vision OS2 back in June and I realized I didn't want to be in this version of Apple's ""walled garden."" It's rather silly, but hear me out.

They touted this feature allowing the keyboard to ""passthrough"" so that you can see and type on the keys while still in immersion. This was a feature I really, really wanted because it helps with my focus to be immersed, but it's hard to see what I'm typing.

The problem is, this feature is only allowed for Apple's keyboards, like the Magic Keyboard. I have some mechanical keyboards I love to type with—and if Apple allowed, VisionOS could be taught to recognize their shape like they recognize different user hands. But no. Apple insisted the keyboard only be Apples.

I get their POV that they don't want to support 3rd party things, but at that point, I realized I was trusting a company to literally allow its own products to appear in my view, and was blocking the products I preferred and enjoyed using. There was something unsettling about that, and it cemented my decision to sell the device. I just don't like the implication."
2024-09-28,"Yes. From what I’ve read they need to fix the weight issue with all these devices. 

And then they need the software to make them worthwhile. For example a fully 3D Skyrim equivalent might just get me over the line.

Ultimately it has to be something immersive and entertaining that I can do from my sofa to replace my TV, because I’m sure as hell not wearing this stuff outside the house.

If wearing VR headsets in public is a thing for my kids and grandkids then great. But it’s not something I think I’ll want or need in my own lifetime. I always knew I needed an iPhone long  before they were invented, due to using Palm devices and clearly seeing how and where they should go. I know I want a self-driving car. I still dream of “thought-to-text” technology.

But I don’t think I’ll ever want or need a VR headset except as an optional gaming device."
2024-09-28,ios should be strictly for iphones or any device with a smaller screen.
2024-09-28,"> For what is basically an enthusiast only device, you can’t force the same restrictions as a mainstream iPhone.

Yeah, as soon as I heard it was going to be locked down, and stuff like app developers not being *allowed* to use the term ""VR"", I lost all interest in the product.

If I'm spending that much money I want to be able to do whatever I want with the product. This is NOT like an iPhone, which is more of an appliance. 

You can't even run stuff like VRChat on it. It's artificially limited; it is capable of so much more than what Apple is allowing on it."
2024-09-28,"It really would have been fantastic, and I guess that's just the direction I had hoped Apple would have taken it. Unfortunately, the time when I got the most productivity out of my Vision Pro was when I had it connected to my Macbook Pro. It was great, but not $5k great, and at the end of the day Apple just chose to go with the walled garden of iOS which isn't a direction I want to go for my needs. The ""computing"" part of ""spatial computing"" was very cumbersome, even with external mice and keyboards, it just wasn't worth it to do what my laptop and a 4k monitor can do.

Pity. I was really hoping Apple would be the one to bring the AR/VR-whatever of dreams into reality."
2024-09-28,"I mean that’s basically what it is if you use it as an external display.

It’s just an expensive Mac display that’s clunky to activate.

It’d be nice if they used the built in M1 to actually run the Mac and make it reliable, but.. this is what happens"
2024-09-28,"Large and expensive headsets like the Vision Pro need to be able to replace laptops for productive work. It is the only strategy that makes sense for them, their high cost is impossible to justify otherwise."
2024-09-28,It's never going to happen because Steve Jobs is dead and the current Apple executives are like heroin addicts for the App Store commissions.
2024-09-28,Do you find reading MacOS text comfortable on AVP? I don’t. The apps would need to be redesigned.
2024-09-29,I’ll settle for iOS with mouse support…
2024-09-28,You can. But you're limited to essentially one monitor. And while it's nice to have a giant floating IMAX screen size computer monitor it still doesn't feel nearly as easy or intuitive as just using my 27 inch 4K monitor. It's hard to describe other than it feels like working on a very large TV so you have to blow up the font sizes of a lot of apps in order to get them to feel comfortable and to get the viewing size acceptable.
2024-09-28,"Exactly. I guess my enthusiasm for the potential of ""spatial computing"" overrode what was actually being delivered, and it took a few months of really trying use the AVP as my primary computer to come to the same conclusion you did. I've always been an early adopter, but with the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and more the devices felt like they solved actual problems with less friction."
2024-09-28,">makes so much scents

FTFY"
2024-09-28,Imagine alien vs predator on that thing
2024-09-28,"After reading the wiki for this title, I saw an entry that said there is a Netflix movie adaptation of this called “the Perfumier” released in 2022, assuming of course this is the same book you’re referring to.

Also, nice username!"
2024-09-28,"I have not but thanks for the rec, I’ll check it out!"
2024-09-28,"The odd thing is, the nReal/xReal/whatever they're calling themselves now AR glasses *can* do this, and they're *far* less powerful than the Vision Pro.  

It's still slightly janky, the software is still in ""beta"" (though it's been out for a long time), and the displays themselves are much lower resolution.  *But*, you can set up an array of three virtual displays, which is very cool.

The Vision Pro obviously has the power to spare - if Apple wanted to do this badly enough, they certainly could.  This was actually the use-case that would have most likely sold me on a Vision Pro."
2024-10-01,"Tim Apple is a joke for letting them greenlit that Vision Pro nightmare in the first place. It’s ok if y’all find it useful but at that point it’s a sunk-cost fallacy. 

Quest is way more useful at a cheaper price. Facebook also does not lock down your $3k+ brick."
2024-09-28,I honestly can't tell if this is satire or not...
2024-09-30,"Did… did you not [see this](https://youtu.be/rzefQ-DRa-8?si=Q_rru5qiaaqKKbxi) though?

At that point multiple screens is a burden to me. Just this alone upgraded this device from a need to an absolutely-must-have for my workflow."
2024-09-28,"It’s poor. It can only be enlarged so much, and the PPI at the largest setting is still way worse than a Retina display. Plus then you have distortion to contend with."
2024-09-28,"I worked at a startup twelve years ago that did this. We were actually partners with matterport; our tours were rendered instead of scanned. And man oh man would we have loved to have had AVP. Getting our software into a form where customers could use it was most of the battle; 3d in a web page was still an experiment and most customers’ machines were too underpowered to run it. Even if it worked, they couldn’t figure out how to navigate 3d in 2d. We tried oculus dev kits (hadn’t been released yet), but they felt like an experiment and    made everyone nauseous. 

These use cases are coming to maturity with devices like AVP. Apple isn’t wrong about spatial computing,  it’s just early days. We now have the hardware we wanted back then, but culture will be slower to catch up. But Apple plays the long game. They can outwait you, as they did with iPhone, iPad, Watch, Apple Pay, AirPods, or any other now-ubiquitous “flop”. How many years away is the Vision that costs $999 and comes in 5 colors?"
2024-09-28,It's incredible for potential thieves too. Makes it 10x easier to practice raiding the houses.
2024-09-30,"You don’t need an AVP for this though, the optics and processing on the $500 Quest 3 can handle this just fine. 

What AVP SHOULD be better for is media viewing, AR and using as a monitor replacement but they don’t really have apps to support the first 2 well yet and it’s way too expensive for that."
2024-09-28,To be honest I found I had the same issue with my Oculus. HL Alyx was a great experience but the novelty of VR wore off pretty quickly. There just weren’t enough use cases where I thought I’d rather be doing this with a box strapped to my face.
2024-09-28,"Vision is a new platform, and like with Watch they are taking a spaghetti approach. Watch was released as an app machine like the phone; it wasn’t for a few years that the device found its focus and they sharpened the product, and its marketing, towards notifications, fitness, and health features. Vision is way more capable and has some killer uses already, but I bet in a few more iterations we’ll see the primary cases emerge and the platform be reshaped around them."
2024-09-28,"Gonna be difficult, I don't want to spend my resources and a lot of time making a special app for a platform with a handful of users, I'd be losing money. A lot probably don't even want to adapt their existing apps from other platforms.

Apple knows this and that's probably why they've tried to position it as a new way of doing general productivity and some multimedia, rather than the mythical killer apps."
2024-09-28,"> There are barely apps for Apple Watch

Because it's hard to integrate ads and users don't want to pay for apps."
2024-09-29,"I do both pretty evenly, both are comfortable for me. I don’t use the solo band though I use the dual loop strap"
2024-09-28,"It's a massive screen for anything. Use moonlight to stream any 2D PC game, or ALVR for any VR game. It's amazing, from Tears of the Kingdom to Red Dead 2 to Half Life Alyx."
2024-09-29,I stream either my PS5 or my gaming PC. Mostly College Football 25 right now.
2024-09-28,"Dude people don’t use mobile devices for gaming, we all use consoles or pc. You can stream your ps5 to it easily with a free app on 1080p or if you have a pc, you can stream 4k, and it works at about 3-4ms latency if you have a good networking setup.

I have occasional spikes at 4k as my girlfriend often also plays online or watches videos, so to avoid problems I play at 1440p so I never have any issues whatsoever. With the 100” monitor you don’t notice the difference much as most games are upscaled to 4k, rather than native anyway."
2024-09-28,Try the quest 3. It’s a lot better than the 2 and has many of the features that the Vision Pro has.
2024-09-28,"""Unapologetically plastic"" ;P"
2024-09-28," Vision Pro Max: MORE glass, MORE aluminum, stainless steel, titanium, MacOS (pls) and MORE expensive."

2024-09-28,Yes
2024-09-28,Entertainment that only requires 1 hand
2024-09-28,What’s the difference between not believing someone and simply not believing someone?
2024-09-28,Media consumption pretty much. I think the tech is very impressive. But it’s not as practical for me I guess. More of a to-do to try to use it. It’s clunky and not the most comfortable for me.
2024-09-28,"I basically only use my ipad when i travel. But its the GOAT for travelling. Second screen anywhere, can actually get work done on planes. Great device"
2024-09-29,"It’s about to become a whole lot better with the option to create a wrap around screen. As it stands now, it’s good enough for traveling imo."
2024-09-28,Yeah if it was $1000 I’d probably already have one
2024-09-28,"MacBook Air was kinda in the same boat when it first released. Looked great, but underpowered and ahead of its time. Thankfully, Apple stuck  with it and iterated until the hardware caught up with the product."
2024-09-28,"This is my premise. The phone becomes a server in your pocket and the glasses only have to have thin client capabilities. Limit their processing requirements, amp battery to the max, my phone can be twice as thick with a worse or no display at all, just near-field to the glasses."
2024-09-28,"Until you try it and enjoy any piece of UI at 4k and seamless interaction with eye tracking and pinching, then you might change your mind or just not care. Most people that try mine don’t ask “why would I use this instead of my phone?”, but rather “when are they doing a cheaper version, and does it have app A or B?”."
2024-09-28,"I find it is better quality than other displays I have, and it’s relaxing because I can lay down. In fact, that is the number one reason why I pick it up instead of another screen is because I can lie anyway I want and have the screen perfectly in front of me, and look at social feeds or something Else like News without having to hold my hands up in front of me."
2024-09-28,"Absolutely!

^offer ^exclusive ^to ^virtual ^reality"
2024-09-30,Apple PR couldn’t live with all those typos.
2024-09-28,"Maybe it could have been $2500 or $3000, but the technology is honestly mindblowing and I understand the high price tag. I just don’t think it’s useful enough to warrant keeping unless it was like $1500 or below. But the technology seems too sophisticated to be that inexpensive."
2024-09-28,Threw it in my Roth IRA
2024-09-28,"Uh, why not? Scrolling is really easy with just pinching and dragging. Its p chill to just zone out in an environment in VR with Apple Music playing and reading Reddit"
2024-09-28,"I literally use Reddit and X on it every day. This is like saying “nobody uses Messages on their MacBook, it’s already on your phone”. Technology is all about meeting users where they are. If I’m on Vision Pro maybe watching something, or using it as a Virtual Display or streaming pc gaming on it to get advantage of the big screen, I want to be able to also check my mail calendar and reddit.

Also it’s the whole point of multi tasking. It’s just another type of screen, I don’t know why this is so strange to you lol"
2024-09-28,"I browse in it, don’t post though lol"
2024-09-28,Nah. I just don’t feel comfortable. No one else wears anything like it.
2024-09-28,"Naah, I’m planning to take it into the office when I go back as it’s part of my work setup, people are not gonna care that much past the first round of questions."
2024-09-28,"Not really yet. They have some 5 min shorts that are clips for what I assume are upcoming releases. Documentary or highlights style, not full games unfortunately."
2024-09-29,"Yes, but it only works for some services. Tried to get it working with Amazon Prime and was unable to."
2024-09-28,"No, not super heavy. They left the battery off to reduce weight. I use an open face kit to take pressure off my face, and it’s very comfortable"
2024-09-28,"Naah it’s 400gr and less without the light seal. You bug a vertical headstrap to move the weight from the forehead to the top of your head, it’s like 30£, and you can wear it for hours, I do that and my eyes are well rested after."
2024-09-28,"There’s a YouTube app, but it’s third party. Works alright though!
Also you won’t find TV apps on computers, they’re only available on TVs."
2024-09-28,"Not on avp as yet. Working on 1 currently that is avp first and a couple of other that may come to avp. 

Had a Quest mixed reality title I worked on come out last week called Starship Home."
2024-09-28,Er ?  What is Siri if not AI?  Is a bad one now but that is what it is.  Or did you think there was an actual little mentally challenged person living inside your phone?
2024-09-28,"I didn't find the resolution of the Quest 3 even high enough to work as a computer monitor.

Also, I do use some iPad apps in the Vision Pro, like Slack and DuoLingo.  It's a pretty big advantage to be able to run most iPad apps."
2024-09-28,"But there's music, even DAW for iPad. I don't see this for the Vision Pro (yet). It does mean that you'll need a Mac sending a feed to the VP to run a DAW or a Virtual Instrument, isn't it?"
2024-09-28,Not a ton. We had ideas but we needed to use it to pick a few. I’m more hopeful the next few might get a bit more traction.
2024-09-28,It’s a fair question asked in an antagonistic and bad faith way…
2024-09-28,Apart from once when they showed off that magic charger and then couldn’t make it work.
2024-09-28,"Yes, they are working on Apple Glass."
2024-09-28,💯- think the feedback is clear that people want Vision Pro to be more like a Mac/PC experience for productivity but Apple kinda built a face iPad. Something like Orion will inevitably take off and kill face iPad.
2024-09-28,"> The AVP is something I'd wear if I'm doing hardcore work

Cap. It's heavy as fuck and it's a glorified iPad strapped to your face. No you wouldn't."
2024-09-28,They'd actually look better with a small piece of white tape wrapped around the bridge.
2024-09-28,And grease splattering on the front glass
2024-09-28,"That wasn’t the point. We were talking about the buzz for AVP. I have seen nothing recently for AVP, but have also seen nothing for Quest 3. How many either has sold isn’t relevant to that discussion. Pepsi sell millions of drinks and I haven’t seen a Pepsi commercial for ages."
2024-09-28,What made you want to buy it?
2024-09-28,From my limited experience the eye tracking is cool. Everything else the Meta Quest 3 can do. The cameras are at a much higher resolution in the Vision Pro but it is also $3000 more expensive.
2024-10-02,"Thank goodness I returned it. After 1st week, I had to force myself to use it"
2024-09-28,OP: Yes.
2024-09-28,Why isn’t OP responding? I want to know if he’s selling.
2024-09-28,"Do you ever look at her like wtf, why’d he get that penalty? Only to realise she’s watching something entirely different.."
2024-09-29,Y'all should get one of those 3d tvs that allow you both to watch something different at the same time. Not entirely sure if they ever actually came out though.
2024-09-28,I have a PSVR2 so I have an idea on the ergonomics
2024-09-28,The weight balance is more important then the weight itself
2024-10-01,Isn't that really the issue though? We all romanticize the idea of it and that is why everyone gets excited about new launches but after a few weeks reality sets in and these just aren't the products we imagined. What we all really want is a borg implant that doesn't make us look like monsters.
2024-09-28,Why are you being downvoted? This would be awesome on a plane or as a car passenger as well

2024-09-28,"This person gets uncomfortable looking down at a screen and moving their hand to tap things on an iPad. 

They have no muscles whatsoever"
2024-09-28,"???

It’s not an actual brick dude lol"
2024-09-28,"You underestimate how taxing it is on your back and neck to have your head in a forward leaning, downward position staring at a screen. Likely more energy spent doing that than if you are completely upright and balanced with the heads set"
2024-09-28,"Cause I want to lay down, and the iPad is nowhere near a big enough screen, and if I open another 2 apps, the main window is gone, as the screen is limited. This is all about removing screens basically and using your space, meaning you can be almost in any position with your head, you would see the same!"
2024-09-28,Compared to what other device sorry?
2024-09-28,"From what I can tell blue light is the biggest concern, for sure, but with good breaks it should be alright. I have less eye strain using though than when I use my phone or ipad for a similar amount of time, as my I’m not focusing on a small rectangle in front of me, but on much larger and far away targets.  Plus my neck is not down like with my phone.

Longer usage can definitely cause problems I think, not sure the impact long term, but short term I see a little improvement on eye fatigue."

2024-09-28,"FWIW the Meta Quest supports a dozen or so Bluetooth keyboards from different brands, including Apple."
2024-09-28,"> I get their POV that they don't want to support 3rd party things

I do not. I remember growing uo with accessories being compatible with both macs and pcs."
2024-09-28,"The trade off for being a closed ecosystem was the benefit that “it just works!” and we got a more seamless experience.

What I’ve noticed is that over the last ~8 years the “it just works” isn’t always there- I get very annoying and long lasting bugs that continue to persist for years (despite filling clear tickets explaining how to reproduce).

I think the complexity of the Apple ecosystem has gotten so much that they cannot maintain quality of that seamless user experience :/"
2024-09-28,I wonder if it works with a 20 year old A1048 keyboard.
2024-09-28,Always gotta be earning 30% off of others work and products. You want to use your third party keyboard? Stop being selfish and give up 30% of your salary to Apple.
2024-09-28,Genuine question. Can you not write on a keyboard without seeing the keys?
2024-09-28,"Re: keyboards, that’s in part because they had to train a ML model to recognize keyboards. If they had made it work with any keyboard, it would also have more false positives and show other random things through."
2024-10-10,I’m in the boat of “call me when AR contact lenses exist”
2024-09-28,"the external Mac display in AVP is not in 3D. you can't move each application's windows all around you. It's limited to be within the window. So it's kind of a paradox, that you have a spatial computer but you are using it to show a Mac's display limited by 2D.

It seems like a huge opportunity missed."
2024-09-28,"if it actually worked as a universal external display I would have used it 10x more.

But it's only mac, and even that on only one window with limited resolution/refresh rate. 

or you jank your way with moonlight on PC and hope wherever you go has FLAWLESS internet. I've said this like a million times over at the AVP sub, but a simple wired port for display would have solved every problem I have with this device."
2024-09-29,"It really is such a shame that the best computing devices are made by a company that is so against the superuser. I guess that’s just what happens, you make the best device, normal users buy it, and normal users have a better experience with a locked down device that can’t be as easily broken by accident or run malware."
2024-09-28,"Not familiar with a Netflix release, but there is a theatrically released movie that is very good. Has Dustin Hoffmann in it iirc. 

Both the book and the movie have the same ending, which is… interesting. One of a few endings that have made me go 😳🧐🤯"
2024-09-28,What would they add for AVP2 then?
2024-09-28,"No, it’s a common complaint. The Mac “extended desktop” is literally just the Mac’s one screen floating instead. The actual Mac screen goes black and just transfers to a floating window instead. It’s not an extended display, and you can’t do multiple external-display-style windows… which is, like, the only damn thing most work-users wanted it for."
2024-09-29,"The reason I made the comment was ""adding complexity"" rarely improves productivity... not really the multiple virtual desktops issue. 

My thoughts, relating to the bandwidth issue, is if you *did* have multiple virtual desktops you only really need *the one you're currently looking at* rendered in high definition – the ones in your peripheral vision need only to upscale when you focus on them..."
2024-09-28,"I feel the same way about my Index. When VR ""works"", it's goddamned revolutionary.  But there are so few games/applications that do it well that it's relegated to being a toy.

HL Alyx, as you mentioned is amazing.  The first time you load up Google Earth in VR is impressive as hell.  But after that it's really more of a toy to play some cool 3D arcade games (I love Space Pirate Trainer, as an example).  If it'd caught on, we might see more, but it was unfortunately kind-of a flash in the pan."
2024-09-29,Huge difference is that it runs a variant of iOS so optimizing an existing app to run on visionOS is less difficult than to write dedicated apps for each platform
2024-09-28,"So many people don’t get that it’s all about what you already do but with massive and flexible screens. I believe it’s been massively under advertised and people think it’s a tv, then complain there’s no content lol"
2024-09-28,"It's a shame that the Quest is tied to Facebook. The hardware's priced well, and the software ecosystem is probably as good as anything out there.  Unfortunately, it's tied to a company that I really, *really* want nothing to do with."
2024-09-28,yeah a big problem with the vision pro is that the quest 3 basically does a lot of what it does with more games lol

2024-09-28,The cameras pointing down for hand gestures must be getting crazy!
2024-09-28,A hand that will be watched and tracked by the cameras the entire time.
2024-09-28,It’s simple.
2024-09-28,"For me it turned out, it was the fact that the screen was not flexible enough and having to use a keyboard meant I don’t get the flexibility of holding it in my hands conveniently, unless you buy the expensive Apple keyboard.

I got the AVP now and actually sorted all the issues. The iPad is still nice to use for me when I’m at my desk if I’m not using the Vision Pro as I can quickly check a few things while I work at my laptop, but it does not add as much value at this point for me…"
2024-09-28,"I bought in at $1800 and I feel it’s probably worth $1500 as is. Happy enough at that price, but at $3900 retail? No."
2024-09-28,"I don’t doubt I would love it, but it’s one of those extra devices that I would love for two weeks and then the excitement would wear off because it doesn’t necessarily fill a hole in my needs, it’s something else to hassle with etc etc. I just did this same thing with an iPad. I loved it and used it for about two weeks and now I realize it doesn’t really do anything I can’t do with my laptop and phone, I barely pick it up. 

I’m waiting for those AR glasses level tech. After seeing Meta’s Orion demo I’m more hopeful we will get there soon. And I’m sure Apples version will be the tits."
2024-09-28,"That would be a really dark game, one where you have good health insurance and can afford to live beyond paycheck to paycheck without working multiple jobs. A dream. But IRL you probably wouldn’t be able to afford the Vision Pro…"
2024-09-29,"Is it though? MacBooks have been in that price point forever and while they have had performance gains, there hasn’t been anything innovative. It seems to me that’s the perfect price for Vision Pro."
2024-09-28,"See, I like this. I just don’t want to spend so much money for the experience."
2024-09-28,"Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tim Cook’s Reddit account."
2024-10-01,"With Apple being so involved in MLS, you'd think they could put one 3D camera (an iPhone?) at each game."
2024-09-29,"Surprised a popular app like Amazon prime wouldn’t allow that. Does prime work in Apple TV channels in the tv app? Sometimes I get a better experience not using the app, I just go to the tv app, scroll through the sidebar to the service and click it and it tends to work better. Like the shudder app my wife subscribed to is better in Apple TV channels. 

Otherwise, I guess just turn on a show on both devices and try to sync them up? Apple should really have a better solution to all this"
2024-09-29,I would think that at some point they will come out with an app for the Vision Pro depending on where Vision Pro is in ten years.
2024-09-28,Whats the Starship home about?  Sounds like a game
2024-09-28,"If apple is going to reshape the company around AI/Siri then the current state of Siri isnt good.

It is miles behind Alexa or Google home so building everything around an inferior program isnt a good idea

I mean, just last night, I asked Siri on my HomePod to message a friend and she replies, there is no (friends name) in your contacts. A minute before she read me a message from that person"
2024-09-28,"There’s a few apps for music editing already, but I can’t speak to the quality. In that case you’d just mirror your mac display to it, which works well for 99% of use cases.

https://youtu.be/b3PJ6bCvjTI?si=1ljny938n_wbw-XO

In this example, the point is not to necessarily run it on the device itself, but to use it from it, so you can use other stuff (like instruments) while you look at it. I do this with my piano lessons, I use the AVP with factime and sit at the piano with the music sheet app opened and the teacher sees what I see, piano and music app, so they can follow my hand movement and direct me on the sheet where I go wrong (given they see that too)."
2024-09-28,"Thanks for the answer, I was curious how well pre-development went if you had done a lot. I hope your next app goes well!"
2024-09-28,"Sure, there is a bit of sarcasm in there, but bad faith?"
2024-09-28,"Yep, apart from that."
2024-09-29,"Again, different form factors for different use cases.

If I don't want to look like a dork wearing AVP in public, I'd buy the Meta Orion glasses (whenever they come out) or the Meta/Rayban smart glasses which look like regular sunglasses."
2024-09-28,This was regarding your own comment that ‘these devices aren’t for masses’. You’re clearly wrong unless by ‘these’ you refer exclusively to AVP.
2024-09-28,Yeah I tried the demo it’s pretty neat but I just think it’s something I won’t use.
2024-09-28,Cool new tech gadget and disposable income would be my guess.
2024-09-28,I really enjoyed my Quest and thought Apple could do a better job. Wasn’t the case.
2024-09-28,FOMO and a lack of impulse control I’m guessing
2024-09-28,I’d like a cheaper version for working. Rather than being limited to my laptop and widescreen monitor it’s all there just in the goggles with even more space. Or maybe it wouldn’t be as friendly to use as I’m imagining
2024-09-28,Tim Apple came to me in a dream and told me that I had to buy it
2024-09-28,wait in line pal I’ve been waiting for that marriage to dissolve for years
2024-09-28,The wife or Vision Pro?
2024-09-28,She might be on sale in Facebook marketplace already.
2024-09-28,"Haha nah. Like I said though, it only happens like once a month."
2024-09-28,"Exactly—that's the issue. While the weight balance works for sitting, lying down, or light exercise, it doesn't hold up during household chores. You're constantly bending, reaching, and moving, which throws the headset off-center."
2024-09-28,"A very American-centric jump from ""commute"" to ""driving."" Heck, even in America's largest cities that isn't the norm."
2024-09-28,WALL-E prediction!
2024-09-28,I think *lots* of people get muscle/joint discomfort these days from holding and typing on electronic devices.
2024-09-28,I mean it's heavy for something you put on your face. That's all.
2024-09-28,"Compared to holding an iPad at a reasonable distance to your face, the screens being closer pose a risk for blue light radiation (which contributes to macular degeneration) and increased likelihood of myopia from lengthening of the eye.

Tablets and cellphones are the same, VR just increase this likelihood. Then there’s the whole VAC thing."
2024-09-28,"Exactly. It's like a very boring Black Mirror episode. Apple could have designed the keyboard pass through in a way that worked for third party keyboards. Then again, they also could have put MacOS in the Vision Pro, but I have a feeling they wanted to gatekeep all apps going into it and get a slice of the action. Having something on my face like that with a four grand price tag was just too much. I've bought a lot of first gen Apple products over the past 20+ years, but this one feels very corpo-dystopian."
2024-09-28,"I’ve read about that, and I think it’s great. I don’t have a Quest but that’s something they’re doing that’s definitely good. It would have made my productivity so much higher."
2024-09-28,"I mean, I'm 45, so I remember plenty of products requiring different drivers or connectors and having to run to Fry's or dig out an old floppy to get it working. I guess what I'm saying is I don't expect Apple to have native pass through for every 3rd party keyboard built in automatically. But a way to teach VisionOS or to ""cut out"" a 3rd party keyboard doesn't feel like a huge ask when they clearly have the tech."
2024-09-28,"There were people in the Vision Pro subreddit and Discord who got it working with keyboards a similar shape and layout to the Apple Magic Keyboard. I think the keycaps needed to be low profile. I know some people got it working by starting with the Magic Keyboard / MacBook, and then swapping out their other keyboard quickly before the pass through faded."
2024-09-28,"Most people glance at the keyboard occasionally, for example to find special characters.

Also if you’ve ever used VR, you’ll know it’s really hard to orient yourself to objects in the real world of you can’t see them."
2024-09-28,99.99% people can’t
2024-09-28,"I can't. Even though I write for a living, years of bad typing habits and crappy posture have lead to some carpal tunnel that makes it tough to write without occasionally glancing down. Plus, I'm new to Alice keyboards so I'm having to learn the split style typing all over."
2024-09-28,wow I literally thought it was just a mac in VR. What a BS marketing campaign.
2024-09-28,"That’s what the Vision Pro should be about from the start, hence the “Pro” in the name. But it looks like they used this term to justify the price tag not the features of the professional device. It’s not really suited for the general audience and not made for the profesional users either."
2024-09-28,"> but a simple wired port for display would have solved every problem I have with this device.

Yeah this. USB-C passthrough that works with my windows computer would have been awesome. ALVR was too annoying"
2024-09-28,best they can do is usb2.0 over lightning
2024-09-28,Ill have to look into that
2024-09-28,Yes. Exactly. I would happily justify such large payment for VR/AR glasses if it had this feature. Maybe Mac can’t handle it? I highly doubt
2024-09-28,"I don’t really see the value in an extended display mode since viewing other screens through the cameras will be a subpar experience compared with viewing that content directly on the Vision Pro displays. I do see the value in having a very large 4k display when working on a laptop especially (not $3500 value mind you), plus you can multi-task with other apps on the headset itself.

And while it’s not available yet, there will soon be an ultra-wide screen panoramic mode that [Apple says](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/09/visionos-2-for-apple-vision-pro-is-available-today/) is equivalent to two side-by-side 4k screens."
2024-09-28,"Nope, I had a rift which was more than 300 and also required a PC. Also that doesn’t invalidate my remorse."
2024-09-28,Monkeytag and beatsaber aren’t worth $500.
2024-09-28,"HL Alyx, Elite Dangerous, MS Flight Simulator, Hot Dogs and Hand Grenades, there’s a ton of great VR games on Steam. 

Really wish Valve would just release an inexpensive Index."
2024-09-28,"Yeah but for most none gaming things it’s waaaaaaaay worse. Using the Quest 3 as a benchmark is why people say “it’s not worth putting a headset in your face to scroll on X or Reddit”, cause on the Quest 3 it really isn’t a good experience overall, it’s just “fine”."

2024-09-29,"yeah I check the used market occasionally for a decent deal, mostly I see it at around $2000 to $2500, which still feels a bit overpriced. I'll probably grab one around $1000 to $1500, which I am sure they'll hit eventually"

2024-09-29,"Yeah I kind of knew that, but it's a bit of a pain as you have to go get the APK to install where on the AVP you just use teh same App Store to find and install apps... also the iPad apps are usually more advanced than tablet apps on Android."
2024-09-29,I see. That's awesome. Thanks so much. Other videos that I saw weren't as inspiring as this one.

2024-09-28,"1 million is not the masses. And yes, I meant headsets in general."
2024-09-28,Bingo. Had a little more faith in Apple.
2024-09-28,"Is there anything similar to Meta Quest TV with a feed of content that keeps updating? I started to use my quest 2 again recently and I was surprised how much media content they had, from documentaries to concerts and even a tv show!"
2024-09-28,What did they not do better as a headset
2024-09-28,"What does the Quest do that is better? Because it feels like the only thing better about the quest is it has controllers, is cheaper and has been out long enough so has better support. If they released a vision roughly the same spec as the previous vision pro at maybe £6-700 I think they would get a lot more adoption and more people would be invested in writing software for it. 

I cant see any reason on paper the quest (which I own the second iteration of) is even remotely comparable to the vision pro. The Vision pro has a lot more power, it has a lot more sophisticated sensor tech. 

If the os was more open and closer to a desktop os and it was even slightly more reasonably priced for what it was i.e. a first generation punt at this tech I would have booked a flight to the US and bought one close to release."
2024-11-17,You need to be patient.
2024-09-28,"Yes, Apple has been pretty disappointing lately. Not only the Vision Pro, but also the iPhone line 16 is unfinished.
It seems that we have reached technological saturation. Usually things get cheaper over time, especially when there is no development."
2024-09-28,You’re not wrong.

2024-09-28,Please link a source to a peer-reviewed study from a reputable scientific journal for this. There is no scientific evidence on blue light from devices causing macular degeneration.
2024-09-28,"Yeaah that might be, all these need to be used with moderation and the right breaks to avoid longer term issues, just as with everything.

Eye strained though I read it’s better as your eyes don’t need to focus as much on something close. A reasonable distance applies well to a tv, but for most devices, tablet, phones and laptops, is rather impossible to keep away as you would then strain your eyes in reading small text at a distance.

There’s a whole thing I read about eye muscles when it comes to focusing on short distance objects compared to things that are away from you in the distance."
2024-09-28,I hope you sent an email to Tim and the Vision Pro VP explaining your decision.
2024-09-30,What was wrong with installing drivers?? Nobody expects compatibility with all products out of the box. Giving the possibility of installing drivers would be huge and would cost Apple basically nothing.
2024-09-28,"Exactly this. In full immersion it was very hard to orient myself. Even with a padded lap rest and a rather heavy mechanical keyboard upon it, it took much longer than I anticipated to home in on where the keyboard was. Best way I can describe it is like trying to type in darkness."
2024-09-28,I never glance at my keyboard. I fail to type the special character until I hit the right one cause i forget sometimes if its shift or alt
2024-09-28,I mean it’s an iPad in VR with support for mirroring your Mac display. They don’t market it any differently.
2024-09-28,"I think it’s a bottleneck with the wireless connection between the Mac and the Vision Pro. Can’t handle multiple streams of high-res video, and computer monitors have to be pretty high-res to look decent. They could probably do multiple streams of 480p or something, but it would look like crap. They’ll have to get more advanced connectivity, or add a wired USB-C connection or something, before they can do it right."

2024-09-29,"At $1500 you wouldn’t likely have buyer’s remorse for the product as it stands today. It’s a tech demo and very early adopter-ish, but without a doubt the coolest innovation Apple has made in ages. 

The main issue for me is a lack of immersive video content, and not enough app support. You can run iPad apps or mirror your Mac, but it’s not nearly the same as native vision apps. Beyond the immersive film **which blows my mind**, it’s definitely the very best way to watch movies though, especially 3d ones or IMAX. 

My issue is it’s isolating from my wife and kids. And it doesn’t allow my wife a proper “2nd user”, the guest mechanism is janky… and even though we wear the same light seal size, she says it doesn’t fit her securely and it hurts her neck. She’s very petite, so she notices the weight on her neck. I have a 7.75 melon head and don’t notice it as much."

2024-09-28,Had more faith that they would do what? I think they set pretty good expectations when showing it initially (aside from weight and passthrough quality) but I know a lot of people wanted more content.

One time early on they were even able to peer in and watch my screen to determine what I was getting a sort of fisheye / warping effect around certain objects.

It felt like they were very receptive to feedback during the early period. Still, I just think their vision for what the device can and shouldn't do doesn't align with my own use for it, so all the feedback is probably just going into the void."

 Any real effort to develop against it wont happen for 1-2 generations because there are no users ... so you arent going to get any benefit unless you have a use case in mind and can do it yourself.

Thats the same with any new platform."
2024-09-28,"To say the Quest does the same, I wonder if you have both. Honestly it doesn’t do the same even remotely, and I have both AVP, Quest 2 and Quest 3. They are now starting to add more features AVP like, but the device is cooked by its own lack of available CPU and RAM for those mobile apps and not having a first party store where you can find standard apps makes it not worth using it for me.

Plus, even if I wanted to go for sideloading, most apps don’t work as-is, you either need the firestick version from the amazon store (cause they don’t have play services either) or do some hacking, just to install a bloody weather or reddit app.

The OS also has no way to link your accounts, so you get no notifications for mails, calendar events, no password sharing, no browser history, no photos and copy / paste continuity.

I mean, if I am to use any hardware without these things for daily usage, it would be only for gaming.

And I didn’t even cover the stutter and random bugs the OS has as I even open the basic launcher. Being 1/7 of the price doesn’t mean being as good just cause it’s cheap. Price is not the issue here, Quest simply wasn’t born with this in mind. Maybe a Quest 4 would have all these improved, then we can compare."
2024-09-28,"The Quest 3 is a standalone device. It has its own operating system (Horizon OS) and color passthrough, just like the Vision Pro. Only difference is, the screens are lower resolution (with higher FOV) and slower hardware. It’s not just a VR headset."

However, during summer, the battery of my iPhone SE bulged and I needed a replacement immediately. I didn’t want to waste money on a new battery, because the phone itself looked quite beaten up and it was time for a new one, after four years. I was looking forward to the autumn Apple event, to see the new lineup and see what model I could get. My idea was to splurge and buy a Pro. I got a very cheap Motorola smartphone with Android.
The event was ~~more~~ less than underwhelming and now I am reconsidering to just give up Apple and staying with my cheap Motorola replacement."

Watching a 360 video or playing certain games like Alyx or beatsaber are a trip when you first do them. But after a year or two there is no killer app or use case at least for me. I pull it out once every few months to measure with stuff but I don’t use it every day or even every week. It feels like we invented it because we could before we thought of what we actually WANT to do in VR. 

So long story short if you don’t mind spending 300 bucks on a curiosity that does cool stuff once in awhile and you love the newest tech go for it. If this is a lot to you and you’re getting this instead of something like a switch or iPad I’d say save your money until it matures."

I actually used the Quest for occasional gaming though and AVP just doesn’t have anything fun. 

It’s way too expensive for a media and productivity device. The iPad can do everything it does and more without the inconvenience of a headset and battery pack."
2024-11-17,What does that have to do with the Vision Pro not being a good product? I’ve been in Apples ecosystem for about 25 years and this is the first real new category that Cook launched.
2024-09-28,"I think the touchbar suffered from what most apple products that have failed in the past 10+ years suffer from: over-reliance on developers to actually make it useful. 

Touchbar was an interesting concept that never took off and ultimately never even came close to compensating for the functionality it tried to replace. Lack of 3rd party support def helped make that happen. 

Same issue the AVP suffers from, and to an extent both the Apple Watch and the iPad. They release the cool tech without the actual foundation for what it should be doing established, and are relying on developers and users to figure it out themselves. I feel like the App Store helping the iPhone explode into what it has become has led Apple to adopt this over-reliance on developers to actually make their products useful and it’s starting to really hurt their lineup over the long term"
2024-09-28,"It is how it is though. Even if you had 300 grams counterbalanced behind your head with another 300 grams it'd still cause strain on your neck. 

I haven't used it personally but use VR and FPV goggles all the time. Even much lighter goggles cause neck strain so I can't imagine how it is for the AVP.

2024-09-28,"I guess we’ll agree to disagree. Nothing you said is true for me, and I have all the devices you mentioned. What the AVP offers doesn’t exist in the same way in any other device. The Quest has some of it, but I mentioned all the missing things, which are still missing regardless of the price (although they might not matter for you, for me not having basic stuff like a password manager and notifications for mail calendar and other apps I use daily is a deal breaker, so it doesn’t actually do what the AVP does but only a subset you might be ok with).

If we say “the apps you run on AVP exist elsewhere too”, then i agree of course, and that’s the biggest advantage for me, as what else would I use a device for if not the things I need yo do with tech every day? I can also agree itself not 3500$ worth for that, but that can be applied to any other device “why would I spend 1500$ on a laptop to go on reddit, my phone does that already”, “why would I buy a 1700$ 4k oled tv, my hd 1080p 500$ tv already allows me to watch all my shows”."

- Diablo 3  
- Ableton Live 11 with a few Serum VSTs  
- Affinity Photo  
- a tab of Chrome with every major streaming service  
- 4 4k YouTube videos in another window of Chrome (I like those long drone footage videos people make)  
- iMovie with 20 minutes of footage (1080p)

...ALL AT ONCE

Diablo 3 hit harder than the rest because it ran in Rosetta, but I didn't really see much lag until then.

Your assertion about high-speed SWAP is absolutely correct by the way- hard drives are so fast now that SWAP is much more useful than it used to be.

As dumb as this sounds, I'd try the basics like turning it off and on again, make sure stuff is up to date, etc., because an M3 should be way, way overkill for what you're asking. A $300 Thinkpad should be easily capable of what you're doing there."

Personally, I tested a MacBook Pro M3 pro with 18GB and it wasn't enough. I usually have Chrome open with 10-15 tabs or so, music/video streaming in the background, my chat apps, and editing in Lightroom. The processor handles all this just fine and very fast, but the memory pressure kept spiking into the red and it was swapping more than I liked.

Affinity was the first option I examined, as a one-time fee for a full creative suite was very attractive. But even on decent hardware, all three of Affinity's apps lacked the pep to keep up. Combined with the learning curve needed for the transition, Affinity had to be crossed off the list.

2024-07-21,Like u/samj I fell for that BS with the M1 MBP. Bought the 8gb because “8 gb on the m series is like 16gb on intel.” Hogswollop. Within a month I was getting stuttering and occasional low memory errors from the OS. Would have returned it for a better model but I’m in a country like you where no returns are possible.
2024-07-21,"You said yourself… it worked well until you started pushing it. 

It’s designed for most people’s day to day use. No point telling others not to get it when your use case requires more RAM and you didn’t equip yours with it"
2024-07-24,It’s honestly really sad to me that laptops are being sold with 8GB of RAM in 2024 - be it Windows or Mac. 16GB should be the minimum.
2024-07-20,"My wife used a base 2018 mini and I just replaced it with a 16 GB M1 mini. I had asked her many times if she wanted an upgrade and she always said no. Her comment on the M1 mini is that it's a lot more responsive. I'd say that the vast majority of people that do light, casual computer stuff can get by with 8 GB of RAM. If you do more than the basics, though, you'll want more.

It could be folks that want a better screen and speakers but are otherwise only using it for casual use."
2024-07-20,That’s why everyone is questioning why is Apple giving 8GB as base model when it is not enough for current normal workload.
2024-07-20,8GB Macs should have been discontinued a decade ago.
2024-07-20,"It is superior to Air with its screen and ports. I would still get it and enjoy. However, if you are doing intense work makes sense to get a higher configuration"
2024-07-20,"You should know better and I would have just opted for he next step up which has a better chip, 18gb. How many times do you have to read this sub!"
2024-07-20,"Rumor is Apple Intelligence will need about 2GB of RAM, it's why the older model iPhones aren't going to enjoy it - because they have 6GB - only iPhones with 8GB or more will. I wonder if folks with laptops with 8GB are going to feel the squeeze too? It will run, but it's going to eat up a lot of space to keep those models in memory. At least that's what I have heard -- I don't know if that's true though.

I can't imagine in today's age any laptop with less than 16GB (that seems like table stakes now). My new laptop I got has 32GB, which is like ""middle"" spec."
2024-07-20,Why can’t you return it? I thought apple had a generous policy
2024-07-20,"I'd have to check, but I swear my base M2 has 16, did they make the M3 worse?"
2024-07-20,Why i went with the max ram stock i could find
2024-07-20,You made your bed…
2024-07-20,"That’s why I jumped at the deal of M3 Pro MBP with 16GB/1TB at $1422 couple of months back. Even if the fan runs fast and gets a bit hot when running AI/ML tools like Junyper or Anaconda, but this thing is a beast for my daily use."
2024-07-20,"yep , as a dev 8GB RAM is unacceptable, in my country I was able to get a brand new 14 M1 max 32GB for less than base M3 pro ."
2024-07-20,They still sell a MBP with 8 GB RAM? 😲 Swap memory is just a last resort; it has always been horrendously slow.
2024-07-20,"I'm truly ashamed that Apple sells their latest MBP with 8GB. It's supposed to be Pro :-(

u/Legitimate-Coconut79 are you able to return it? And get a 16GB MBP or 16GB Air?"
2024-07-20,"8GB of ram on a modern computer is comically low.  Even my MacBook Pro from 2017 has 16gb of ram, and most desktops i build these days have 32gb for a low end configuration."
2024-07-20,"Honestly… I know more GB is better, future-proofing and all, but I have a base model MBP M2 and I use the entire Adobe creative suite daily and extensively for graphic design and video editing, and for me it’s just great, it’s flying through every single task. Take this information however you want, but for me, working on it is just so enjoyable."
2024-07-20,"Meh, I use it and enjoy it"
2024-07-20,"Swap memory works fine for a lot of things, but definitely not if you start throwing programming and heavy photo editing, and video editing at it. That’s definitely in the “need at least 16GB territory.” See if you can return it and get one with 16GB."
2024-07-20,"8GB of ram in 2024 lol Even for my M1Pro I took 16GB and when I buy the next one, I will take 32GB minimum"
2024-07-20,"Some boomer needs to get their caps lock privileges taken away for a while. Don’t tell me what to do. (This is sarcasm, I empathize with your plight…)

Btw, I have an OG 13” M1 MBP with 8GB of RAM and love the little bastard. It does everything I want and has battery life for days. People should have the option and understand what it can and can’t do."
2024-07-20,"8gb, what were you thinking?"
2024-07-20,"i liked M3 macbook pro, nothing wrong with it. it’s not the air in disguise, you just bought the wrong ram"
2024-07-20,Is this the laptop you just sold me yesterday?
2024-07-20,"If you have to upgrade to 16GB anyway, you should just get a M3 Pro MBP that comes with 18/512 standard.  It’s ridiculous to spend $200 per RAM and storage upgrade step for MBAs or the base MBP from their base 8/256 configurations and you’re still stuck with objectively inferior hardware."
2024-07-20,"I had two options 1499$ 24GB RAM 1TB 13inch M3 MBA or 1800$ M3 PRO MBP 18/512 
I went with M3 Pro NEVER EVER THINK BELOW 16"
2024-07-20,You spent so much extra for 1TB of storage but couldn’t bother paying to get more RAM?
2024-07-20,"yeah, this is why I was avoiding the cheap/base M model best buy sales. Sticking to 16gb intel which is slow at processing but holds alot in memory even though its 16GB DDR3. They really should make 16GB the base M's and 24/32 for the high spec. Saving up for the upcoming M4 with at least 16GB if not higher ram."
2024-07-20,Yes I bought a base model MBA M2 with 8GB of RAM and it was not enough. Now I have a M3 Pro MBP with 36GB of RAM and its much more comfortable!
2024-07-20,8 Gb of RAM was not enough for anything even in 2016.
2024-07-20,"I got my m3 MBP a few weeks ago, I was initially interested in buying M1 MBP or M2 MBP, waiting for a long time on Apple Store, always displays that m1 and m2 were out of stock, I eventually went to Best Buy and asked the staff there if I could get a M1 MBP. Long story short, they have it, but the whole staff there were trying so hard to persuade me to get a M3 MBP instead, quote by one of the staff there” Idk what yt video you watched but M3 is better bcz that’s the latest and it does have AI.” I eventually gave up and get an M3 MBP bcz that’s the only model w Apple care 🙂"
2024-07-20,"Sell it and upgrade? 🤷‍♂️ I bought the 18gb ram with 1tb M3 and I actually got the message “your system has run out of memory, please close these programs…” running Adobe suite photoshop, I design and illustrator with Safari… had a 16gb RaM 2017 intel and I NEVER got that message running the same apps. So yeah, something fishy…"
2024-07-20,"The 8gb ram MacBook is for casual users only. What you are working with Photo editing, you definitely need a one with 16GB RAM at least. I would suggest you make an Apple care appointment to see if you can exchange it for baseline M3 Pro MBP. Its baseline version has 18GB RAM by default. 

I myself was going to buy M3 Pro MBP baseline version. But i got a pretty sweet deal for 2019 MacBook Pro with Intel Core i9 2.4GHz, 32GB RAM, 1 TB SSD for 900 USD with 90 days warranty. Really happy with the purchase."
2024-07-20,I have run Adobe Photoshop and Affinity Photo on MBP M1 8gb and everything is okay
2024-07-20,"I bought the 36GB 2TB Max and it gets crazy laggy with photoshop and illustrator; hope Adobe can figure out how to use the hardware, it’s worse in some ways than my late-2014 16GB 500MB MacBook, I don’t get it."
2024-07-20,you're missing the other 90g of ram to be productive
2024-07-20,"Yea, like others said 8gb was the mistake. I’d try to see if I could sell the Mac and recoup most of the money, then buy another Mac with 16gb ram. Even something like a M1 Pro with 16gb ram would perform better."
2024-07-20,"I was just futzing around the other day and was using 21 gigs of ram, can’t imagine being stuck with the base 8"
2024-07-20,I was able to by a 18g 513 m3 pro mbp for like 1699 pre tax. Way better deal.
2024-07-20,"Affinity Photo it’s not Optimized. I wouldn’t judge a device from the experience with it. I have a very good desktop and affinity software works like 💩. 
Test it with Lightroom.
Or with Capture One"
2024-07-20,"No shit man, 8gbr is ass for anyone who does any moderate/heavy work loads// allocating ssd for ram is okay in theory but the results are terrible"
2024-07-20,8GB of ram is killing you. CPU and gpu wise it is fairly solid as an entry point in the M3 lineup.
2024-07-20,Someone needs to put every single configuration side by side and do a speed test on it.  Because right now no one seems to know what to do with all these configurations or maybe that’s the point.
2024-07-20,Don’t beat yourself up too much op. Apple are jokers for selling computers with 8GB of RAM using a ‘Pro’ moniker.
2024-07-20,Agreed! 8GB of RAM is borderline unusable in my experience. I had an 8GB m1 Mac mini and that machine would regularly beachball when doing anything even remotely demanding. Safari and iMovie would show significant memory pressure. DO NOT settle for the 8GB variant. 16/18GB should be treated as the minimum.
2024-07-20,Yeah 8gb ain’t gonna get you far these days.
2024-07-20,We’ve been saying that for months. Fanboys defend Apple like their lives depend on it. Get the m3 pro 18gb model on sales for $1700. Love mine
2024-07-20,Never 8.
2024-07-20,8GB ram with 1TB drive is too funny.
2024-07-20,M3 Pro 18gb of ram here.
2024-07-20,Why would you buy a pro FOR PRO USE with 8 Gb?..
2024-07-20,I’ve got the same laptop as OP and have been using Photoshop and Lightroom at the same time with Chrome opened with seven tabs and it runs fine. I mean I edit sports stuff so maybe each image isn’t as resource hogging but still - it’s been fine.
2024-07-20,"I have the same model but with 24gb ram, yes 8gb is not enough."
2024-07-20,used photoshop on m1 air 8gb and everything worked fine
2024-07-20,You can return up to 30 days after purchase!!
2024-07-20,"I bought the M3 version, but maxed out the RAM to 24GB. I did it more for future proofing than anything else, but yeah buying 8GB RAM (even on the MacBook Air in 2024) is not something I would recommend."
2024-07-20,Have you returned it yet?
2024-07-20,One day they will make 8GB obsolete (maybe?)
2024-07-20,yeah don’t do it if you plan to do anything more than you would with a chromebook
2024-07-20,"My MacBook M3 Pro with 16GB RAM is struggling!!…. I’m merely doing playback on Filmora and my CPU is bottlenecking!! I bought it thinking it’d be a major performance boost, but my 10 year old HP didn’t have these issues at all…. I feel if I got an apple product like Final Cut Pro then maybe it’ll be better?

All in all, I thought I paid good money for something better. What a bust"
2024-07-20,They still sell 8gb models?? 😂😂😂😂
2024-07-20,Insane it’s like 8gb of ram regardless of what fancy words you put near it is still 8gb of ram.
2024-07-20,Generally the order of priority is  CPU > RAM > Storage
2024-07-20,2 weeks ago? Exchange it! Get a MBA 16gb
2024-07-20,Wdym. I bought a M3 MBP with 24GB. It’s fine?
2024-07-20,8GB of memory on a $1000 product in 2024 is a sin...on a $1600 product it's a sucker product.
2024-07-20,Just get a M1 Max
2024-07-20,Bro 8gb in 2024? Come onnn
2024-07-20,"im kinda in the same spot as you, bought the same MPB and only realized my mistake after i got it, different from you i couldve returned it, but budget is a matter, mainly bc Im in brazil lol, the base MBP was around here is ~$2,6k and i got it for $2k
i also work with programming but i havent been running any VMs so my xp thus far is good"
2024-07-20,"I, too, purchased the same machine as a spare to my M1 8TB, and prefer to.use it instead when using Photoshop. It absolutely rips through many (130+) images uploaded from raw in Bridge to jpgs in PS. Generative Fill is, at least, three times faster than the M1."
2024-07-21,"You use the Affinity and you bought a Mac with only 8 gigs of RAM? Dude, most people who use professional apps know they use a lot of RAM. Why the heck would you think 8 gigs is enough for complicated work flows? Most people aren’t using pro apps. 

Your title shouldn’t be don’t buy the base M3 it should be, buy the tools you need for the job you plan on doing!"
2024-07-21,"I keep telling people that in the current state of the art, even if you are a casual video editor, graphic designer, etc, someone that does more than the average joe, you should aim for 32gb of ram. That’s “future” proofing for the next 5 to 7 years. Mind that if something fails, paperweight mode activated!"
2024-07-21,"This is why I hate when people say “ 8gb with apple silicon is 16gb on intel”  ram is ram, when you run out you rely on swap and memory compression which will eventually become noticeable. SSDs are not as fast as ram, and memory compression is only so good because it takes a hit on cpu cycles to compress and uncompress not to mention compression is only so efficient depending on the data"
2024-07-21,Don't buy any Macs with only 8GB - regardless of what Apple tell you.
2024-07-21,It’s the ram that got you. Have to be 16gb+.
2024-07-21,"Every time I see one of these posts, I miss Steve Jobs so much."
2024-07-21,I regret getting rid of my M1 16gb thinking my wife would be better with the base M3.
2024-07-21,I got mine on sale for the price of a MacBook Air and it’s basically an Air with a better display and a cooling fan. It works fine for basic video and photo editing.
2024-07-21,It's irresponsible for Apple to even sell an 8GB model.
2024-07-21,"If I’m gonna buy another MacBook Pro, I’m gonna max it all out with the biggest storage and ram that I can get. It’s gonna be one of a beast laptop that’ll last me for a good 10 years."
2024-07-21,"my M2 air with 16 ram and 500 storage is good with everything I do, and I can have open clip studio paint (like Photoshop), a web server, a Android and iOS emulator, vscode and Chrome with 50 tabs and doesn't lag or get hot. your problem is ram, swap is for an extra boost it's not for default use"
2024-07-21,"when people say that 8ram on Mac is like 16 on a windows, it isn't"
2024-07-21,8 GB is useless in 2024. Horrible purchase.
2024-07-21,Is affinity like photoshop where you can assign virtual memory? Check your prefs..
2024-07-21,"I was consistently using 7 to 10gb or swap on my M1 Air. Had to restart the device for it to keep up with my workload for another few hours before it started acting up again. 

My memory pressure would be in yellow or red and lag so bad I never wanted to experience that ever again and got the 128gb ram Pro. I know it's overkill, but not once have I had an issue with that and have only restarted the computer like twice since I got it in December, and I don’t remember it being because I had a major problem  



8gb is definitely not enough"
2024-07-21,"Wtf, 8gb ram and 1tb ssd? You really did a mistake."
2024-07-21,"In my experience, swap does not get read/written to at 7-8 GB/s as you would expect. So loading and unloading the swap takes a lot longer. It’s not even close to being a substitute for RAM"
2024-07-21,You haven't been able to upgrade the ram on a MacBook laptop since what? 2013/2014. So like...10 years.
2024-07-21,I don’t really know what to comment. We’ve been saying for ages - 8GB is 8GB. In order to do anything else other than browsing the web you’ll need more than 8GB of ram.
2024-07-21,"I have an 8/256 GB M2 Air, 16/1 TB M2 Air and a 36/1 TB M1 Max.

I returned a 16/512 GB M2 Pro.

For video editing, 16 GB RAM still uses RAM swap, which is bad because it degrades your hard drive. Somehow, Apple has been able to convince customers that RAM swap is industry standard and best practice.

RAM is so bloody cheap $12 for a stick. The only reason why Apple would go with 8GB of RAM in Silicon MacBooks and make the RAM and hard drive irreparable is so that there are *higher possibilities of customers ruining their MacBooks faster requiring complete replacement*.

AppleCare+ doesn't cover replacement if your model is obsolete, only repair.

If your MacBook can't be repaired or replaced under AppleCare+, you'll receive a partial refund of your AppleCare+ agreement.

My 8/256 GB can barely cope with Google applications. I like a lot of Chrome tabs open. It's simply not as snappy as my 2015 MacBook Pro 16/512 GB.

In my opinion and having built my own desktops, RAM is the single most important component relevant in day to day tasks. There should be a class action that 8GB MacBooks are not fit for purpose in 2024, which includes onboard AI and simple video editing."
2024-07-21,Yet people publicly defend the base M3 MBP lmfao where’s your “8GB on Mac is like 16GB on Windows” now
2024-07-21,8gb of ram in 2024 is criminal
2024-07-21,You got the worse version of the iPad Pro
2024-07-21,Why would you think swap memory solves a RAM problem?
2024-07-21,Never go with none pro or max …
2024-07-21,Try to always get 36 gb
2024-07-21,Every review video I have seen on macbooks has recommended any of them 16gb or up
2024-07-21,P
2024-07-21,"Then honestly, maybe you shouldn't have gotten a MacBook? In the current market, you can get way better specs in a Windows laptop. 
Apple is still a luxury product, and you're knee capping your user experience trying to deal with 8 Gigs of ram anyways.
Would it not be smarter to get a nice Windows laptop that runs whatever you want to throw at it?"
2024-07-21,"And to add insult to the injury, Mac apps tend to hog more memory and storage than their Windows counterparts. I’m talking about apps natively compiled for Apple silicon. 

In my case (data analytics using R), the very same code, running on the same dataset on the same IDE and the same compiler version would use 1.5 GB RAM on Windows and 5-5.5 GB on macOS.

You would want at least 16GB RAM for EVERYDAY usage, and 32-64GB if your use case is memory-intensive."
2024-07-21,i still believe the m1 pro took the cake!
2024-07-21,"the question I have is that if you do a 5 minute search you will see all over the place that 8GB although good for browsing and movies , is not intended for something else.  
SO what drove you to buy this model instead of a 16GB with 512 disk for example?"
2024-07-21,Yeah I made the same mistake with the M1 Mini. Sold it on eBay shortly after and upgraded. It was unusable.
2024-07-21,"... So the real LPT here is ""Don't buy Apple products from authorised resellers in <insert OP's country here>"""
2024-07-21,Idk why Apple even offers 8gb anymore
2024-07-21,I love Apple and their computers. However 8GB is criminally underpowered. I recommend 16GB or even 24GB for work related tasks
2024-07-21,"Well so technically the title of this post should be ""DONT BUY 8GB OF RAM LIKE I DID IF U WORK WITH THESE SOFTWARES"" 8gm ram is good for some people, just enough, but it's not even close to enough for others, like me, I don't even know why u got a 8gm ram but 1tb ssd that makes no sense at all if u knew what kind of work u would make, u could have spent that mineybkr 32gb of ram and them you wouldn't complain, or if u have the high budget, spend just a little bit more on the m3 max with high ram."
2024-07-21,wait what they sell 8GB MacBook Pros now ? What is this the 90ies ? God damn it apple. The greed never stops.
2024-07-21,"I’ve said it a 100x, the macbook pro under 38gb of ram is not for creatives, but to still be selling an 8gb UNIFIED ram as a professional laptop is a scam, 8gb of UNIFIED ram is split between normal ram and GPU ram is just dumb"
2024-07-21,"I’m using a 16/1TB Macbook and it sometimes lags when using multiple Adobe programs, currently regretting not having purchased the 32GB model. 8GB in 2024 is not enough unless you only needed a laptop for Chromebook tasks. Try not using utilities and always close programs if you aren’t using them"
2024-07-21,That worries me. Gonna buy affinity soon. Got an m1max with 32 gb ram I think
2024-07-21,I went with the macbook pro m3 pro for this reason. That base macbook pro is going to be obsolete pretty soon
2024-07-21,I just got mine for $849 I think it’s a great value even for 8GB. You can do quite a lot with it
2024-07-21,"What you are saying here is - 8GB is totally fine until you do photoshop/photo edits. Hmmmm... i can and to this - virtualisation on 8GB is not an option too, but 90% of users dont do video/photo and vms, so 8 GB can still be a good  option for some ppl. I myself have 18GB mbp for VMs/programming and 8GB older surface device for browsing and some light coding. Both are good for what they do."

2024-07-21,How do you like Affinity photo?
2024-07-21,Agree! A toast machine has more ram than 8gb these days.
2024-07-21,And with 2200$ (depends on local  market ofc.) you could get m1 max with 64gb of ram and 32 gpu cores
2024-07-21,Oh man i could’ve told you this. It’s a scam model there to entice people to get the next model up.
2024-07-22,"8 gigs is fine, it's what I am using right now."
2024-07-22,the cheapest macbook m3 pro has 18gb  of ram ...how did you get a mbpro with 8gigs of ram?
2024-07-22,"I am writing this on an Mac equipped with 8GB... I'm not even running any photo apps, just Chrome and VS Code. It It sucks :-)

I would not DREAM of running a photo app without 2x-3x ""normal"" RAM (so 32 or 48GB)

Can you see if there are options for Affinity Photo which result in less memory usage?  You might be better off without unlimited undo, unlimited layers, or whatever memory hogging features they use. Does school require using Affinity Photo, or does it just require a photo editor?

You screwed up, but I'm sure you'll get by. You can always do some tech project for some pay, and try selling the MBP then buying the next model up.

PSA folks, if you have to cut corners on these, cut back on storage. You can always add yourself a NAS or flash drive."
2024-07-22,"8GB is probably for front desk job type cases where you might run a few excel sheets and webpages, not made for any real world development tasks I feel."
2024-07-22,"I bought the M3 Max with 128gb of ram and 4tb ssd. Photostop works perfectly for me, as does anything else I throw at it like premiere or resolve, or even games like cyberpunk."
2024-07-22,"On the contrary, I say that you SHOULD buy the base M3 MacBook Pro, IF you know exactly WHY it is that you're buying it. 
I'm befuddled by the fact that someone could spend over the value of 2200USD (because you're from a third world country that has got to be the value of the device at the very least there), without knowing what their reasoning is for buying it. This logic applies to every purchase of expensive tech ever. 
My first ever self bought computer was the HP Elitebook 1040 and because I had a very low paying part time job in a third world country (Kenya), I needed to know why I'm getting it over the very similar 840. Every minute spec detail had to be explored. That's when I learnt that not all i5s are superior to all i3s because of the gen number and the little code associated with the chip. I learnt what a little more ram or storage can do. Learnt about soldered on chips etc, and it's been an invaluable skill now that I'm finally in the West. 
The base m3 MacBook Pro isn't bad, poor research ahead of spending a shit ton of money IS bad. This, more than anything, needs to be called out more often on this sub.
With even the slightest bit of research on YouTube you'd know that the 8GB variant regardless of storage option on the M3 MBP is heavily criticised by creatives who would recommend getting either 16 GB over upgrading storage, going to the M3 Pro if you're spending that much money anyway, or getting an M1 Pro or M2 Pro MacBook Pro instead of the M3 MBP with 8GB."
2024-07-22,"At least you have nicer speakers! And HDMI and SDHC ports (which some consider so desirable). 



Apple's pricing and cost tier model is crazy. E.g. ""The Ladder"" when you upgrade a MBA and it nears the cost of a base MBP … which would be less capable than the MBA.

The simple way to buy a MacBook is to simply ignore any with only 8GB RAM. With the M2s, ignore the 256GB storage models as well. THEN price shop the models and screen sizes to one's needs.

Myself, I bought an Apple Certified Refurbed M2 MBA  13"" with 24GB RAM and 512GB storage, and it ably handles anything I throw at it. The added memory for caching makes application and file launch nearly instantaneous.  I've been unable to force it to ""thermal throttle"" the CPU with its passing cooling, but I haven't done 3D rendering or heavy 4K movie rendering …YET. Muahaha."
2024-07-23,"Everytime I tell people on this sub to get more then 8of RAM, it seems like the entire sub comes to tell me I'm wrong and that 8GB will be plenty.  8GB is not enough RAM and no amount of swap is going to make up for that.  16GB is the minimum and frankly Apple should spend the extra $8 and just make that the default.  Harumph."
2024-07-23,It’s gotta be the ram. I’ve got a 2017 MBP with 16GB ram and it runs Affinity Photo & designer and DaVinci Resolve concurrently with no issues at all.
2024-07-23,Why do they even sell a mbp with 8 gb is beyond me
2024-09-13,"Hi OP! I have the base M3 MBP with 16gb bought weeks ago and it’s lagging or freezing randomly even with 2 Chrome tabs! I can’t return it anymore as they only have 7days replacement for it. 

The issue still persist even if I followed the Apple CS:

-used Safari as suggested
-uninstall and reinstall OS
-reformat
- watch activity (it still lags even if I have two tabs eating 11gb of RAM
-shut down every time after using

So I’m running out of options and the apple guys even run a diagnostic and told me there’s nothing wrong with the device. 🥹

So here’s to hoping that on Sept 17th the new OS update will fix my problems. Our problems. Haha!"
2024-09-15,"I know this is two months old, but I got the M3 Macbook Air with 16 GB of RAM, and I couldn't be happier for side work. However, I usually edit photos/videos on my Mac Studio, which has 32 GB RAM. Have you ever changed out your computer or not?"
2024-11-06,"had the same issue with the m2 pro. apple memory management is great, but it's really time to let the 8GB config go..."
2024-07-20,"I have a mpb 16"", M1 Max, 64GB, 8 Tb, and last week I imported around 1TB (whick is not crazy) of 4k footage in Premiere Pro.

It was using 180GB Ram. 
64GB ram + swapiing the rest.

I think with 8GB it would have sent all the files to Abobe cloud, so they could train their AI...

Oh, wait..."
2024-07-20,"Base model with 8g ram is for people like me who use it for music, safari, YouTube, movies, mail, FB, Reddit, X, Zoom, FaceTime.  I wanted it for the screen and the speakers. I don't think the fans have even been on yet. Fast and reliable."
2024-07-20,"wait, mbp? 8gigs of ram? It’s not pro. Affinity photos is a little slow though even with faster macs. Atleast that’s with me."
2024-07-20,"If you are within the return windows, why not return it"
2024-07-20,"Hmm, I am a lawyer and using for work 2 computers, both bought 2 years ago:   
- a mac mini m1 (connected to two 2k office monitors) -  8gb ram, 256 gb storage; 

- a macbook pro 13, m1, 16gb ram, 256 gb storage.   
  
Obviously I don't do anything that involves photo editing, programming and stuff. 

BUT when I work I have approximately 7-8 Microsoft Word files opened, about 20 web pages (in safari and chrome) opened, a lot of pdf files (ones with 700-800 pages - books) opened, Microsoft Excel pages, and electronic signature app/email app, calendar and also Brother printer opened.  

Everything is working SUPER fast (from day one) on both mac mini and macbook pro, even if mac mini has only 8gb ram. I actually feel no difference between them. 

So, I guess it depends of the kind of work you do. For office tasks I dare say (based on my own experience) that 8gb is more then enough."
2024-07-20,"Lessons learned in life by a novice student:

1. never buy cheap stuff
2. If you can't afford it, wait and buy when possible.
3. Always buy the latest with the maximum features available.
4. Always get the maximum warranty package.
5. Never go for cheap repairs.
6. Never try DIY with tech or automotive.
7. Always use official accessories.
8. Always use surge protection.
9. Always back up (time machine) weekly, at least.
10. Always use cloud storage for data backup.

2024-07-20,i have a 64gb m3 pro max.. 8 gb will not get you anywhere outside of casual work
2024-07-20,"Yeah it drives me crazy that folks constantly recommend the base M3 14"" on these subs. Every single person considering it would be better off with an Air or stepping up to a Pro chip."
2024-07-20,Cool story Brah
2024-07-20,8gb in a 'pro' is pathetic.
2024-07-22,Everyone says don't buy 8GB since the first M1 Macbook air and people still do it so 🤷🏼‍♂️
2024-07-24,"It's wild how Apple fanboys aren't giving their favourite company any shit for still selling what they will consider a ""top of the line"" laptop crippled with only 8gb of RAM... in 2024.

Hard to have any kind of sympathy for any of you."
2024-07-20,Only a fool would buy 8gb ram. Please research properly in the future. Atleast watch a lot yt videos
2024-07-20,"If you buy a premium laptop with 8GB of ram in 2024, brother you deserve everything bad that comes with it."
2024-07-20,What you are describing is not ram need. It’s cpu need.
2024-07-20,Don't buy Mac next time
2024-07-20,"couldn’t agree more, I could buy a 15” MBA with 16/512 configuration with almost the same amount of money"
2024-07-20,basically the air with fans.
2024-07-20,"Nah, it's the Macbook in disguise.  Pro features with Air specs."
2024-07-20,😂
2024-07-20,but why? should the mbp base version be considered when buying?
2024-07-21,"It’s a screen upgrade version of the Air, with a lot of extra weight. It’s a side grade."
2024-07-21,I don’t even know why it exists. It looks so scammy. But I think it’s there to convince people of that ‘just. A little more….” Trap
2024-07-22,Even a suitably configured MBA could outperform a 8GB RAM MBP IMHO.
2024-07-21,There isn't a MacBook pro tbh. Not a real professional machine. The limitations are way too harsh for large dataset work.
2024-07-24,"Doesn’t really apply to m3 like it did to m1 and m2. The other pros had no pro features other than fans, and literally were the air with fans. These have the pro features on them with Air level spec, mini led display, promotion, etc."
2024-07-20,I really did fucked up this time 🤦‍♂️
2024-07-20,Source on the upcoming xcode needing 16gb?
2024-07-20,What the.. what's this xcode gen AI thingy. I need to read up on it..
2024-07-21,I even suffer with 16gb.
2024-07-20,Depends on the type of programming.
2024-07-20,"Yeah, as programmers are not “most people” they’re not included in “most people are fine with 8GB”."
2024-07-20,"disagree.

i use all of those with 8gb. no problems so far.

not ideal, sure, but definitely decent enough."
2024-07-20,"yeah, that’s the problem, I’m from the Philippines and we don’t have an Apple Store here (just authorized resellers). The only way I can return the product is if it has a factory defect, which it doesn’t have.

Another thing, I’m still a student and it’s my parent’s money and the budget allotted can only buy the said MBP.

I’m thinking if I should trade it for 14” M1 Pro MBP (16/512), do you think it’s a better computer?"
2024-07-20,"It depends on your region. In the US and EU, they are probably quite generous."
2024-07-20,upvoting this because I’m one of those people
2024-07-21,"Like when I told the guy at the Apple Store that I had 32GB on my windows machine and he just said “yeah don’t worry, our ram is so fast that 16gb on an M processor is like 32GB on other laptops”, yeah fuck off mate, what you say about the RAM in Apple laptops is just a lie"
2024-07-21,Also upvoted because this is so important😭
2024-07-21,"8 gb is still relevant for the majority of the population who just makes documents and stream youtube though. I still use 8GB M1 MBA I bought at launch without feeling the need to upgrade at all. 
The general rule of thumb is: if you need 16 GB of ram, you should know it. If you had to ask, get the 8GB. 
However in this case op did not know and thought he could do programming with 8 gb…"
2024-07-22,"My experience points towards 8GB being enough for most everyday tasks, and heavier tasks in good software. Unfortunately I have to use some badly written bloaty software for work with big files (mainly looking at you Microsoft), and that beach ball slaps regularly."
2024-07-20,"problem is: 8gb it's the only viable option their money can afford.

8gb it's not ideal and you will have to pay attention to not let a bunch of things (that you are not using) openned, but it's definitely manageable."
2024-07-20,fuck them

2024-07-21,"It is insane to me. My 2016 pro has 16gb DDR3. My raspberry pi 4 has 8, my phone has 8gb of RAM. My 2018 refurb dell latitude has 16GB of RAM. I can't imagine a NEW laptop with anything less than 16, really at this point 32 DDR4 at minimum, with the standard being 64 since it can't be expanded anymore. Fucking soldering. I'm building a server and *considered* 32 then realized I was being crazy and went for 64. And I can expand whenever I want.

Apple has been making some really awful decisions. I'm still mind blown there is no touchscreen Mac laptop yet."
2024-07-21,always get me lololol
2024-07-21,Why do you say in Rosetta?
2024-07-21,"ohh, haven’t heard of that. I’ll check it out, thanks!"
2024-07-20,bullseye
2024-07-21,"This, since Mac doesn't have dedicated vram either, it's using that 8gb of RAM to do all your visuals.  I'm building a server where I think the on chip apu is going to be ok for logging into my virtual screens and streaming on our TV. I also opted to go with 64gb ram from the jump. Since up to 8gb, and I'll be pushing that, is going to be needed to stream 4k and run a second screen. Meaning my 32gb ram server would really be 24. This math matters."
2024-07-21,Probably why they started including a few extra GB out of the usual 16 32 etc variants. To account for the fact the Gpu needs ram
2024-07-20,right at it!
2024-07-21,"Damn, I’d blame that on adobe at that point. Or even just the m3 max gpu can’t handle it"
2024-07-20,tell me u’r kidding?!?
2024-07-21,agreed
2024-07-21,"woah, I haven’t had that much app open, maybe I should shut it down. I really haven’t shut it down since I bought it (always on sleep). I’ll let u know if it’ll perform better. thanks!

btw, how’s your M1 performing rn?"
2024-07-20,"MSI laptops have well known and documented build quality issues even on their premium devices. In particular it's a matter of when will the hinge break, not if. They do not make financial sense to fix, if they can even be fixed."
2024-07-20,"the MSI laptop definitely! but I can’t let go of the Apple Ecosystem hahaha. I love that I can seamlessly transfer files between my iPhone, iPad, and Mac! Plus I can have my iPad as a second display which is really handy given that I’m staying at a dorm."
2024-07-24,">And it will cost you upwards of $2K!

You're getting ripped off. M3 with 16GB is $2k (well $1999)."
2024-07-20,"tbh, I think it still doesn’t"
2024-07-20,I haven’t heard of that. can u elaborate? like what does it do and what are the benefits and trade-offs
2024-07-20,"actually I’m not expecting a lot, but lagging with barely three apps open, it’s not acceptable for a PRO machine"
2024-07-20,only if we can return apple products here. sadly we don’t have a native apple store here.
2024-07-20,"Affinity 2, what version is the optimized for m series chips?"
2024-07-20,do u think it has something to do with the architecture of m series chip or the lack of optimization of affinity and adobe?
2024-07-20,"will do next time, thanks!"
2024-07-21,"imma take it with a grain of salt, the price difference here in our country is about 600 usd between my base M3 8/1TB and base M3 Pro 18/512. yup, i know it doesn’t make sense, welcome to third world country!"
2024-07-21,"exactly, idk what am I thinking settling for it and what was apple thinking putting it in their PRO machine"
2024-07-21,no such return thing here. the only way to get rid of this computer is by trading/swapping it
2024-07-21,let’s mourn our purchase together
2024-07-21,"maybe apple shouldn’t call it a PRO, then? I wasn’t even doing professional tasks, just schoolworks, hobbies, and stuff"
2024-07-20,"Agreed, I think MBA is a better deal for them since it’s cheaper! I guess 8GB of RAM and “Pro” shouldn’t be used in the same sentence. What’s the point of calling it “Pro” if it can’t even run professional apps/programs?"
2024-07-20,"They should also not sell the base 14"" either; the MacBook Pro should only come with a Pro and higher chip. All that machine does is confuse buyers and crowd the lineup at the $1500 price point. Every single buyer considering that machine would be better off either getting a 14"" Pro on sale or speccing up an Air."
2024-07-20,literally! why call it MB “PRO” if it can’t even perform normal tasks smh
2024-07-20,They hadn’t even discontinued 4GB macs
2024-07-20,couldn’t agree more lol
2024-07-20,no argument is needed for that! the display on this computer is straight-up GORGEOUS! and the speaker… ugh!
2024-07-20,"if only I had the means, it’s a no brainer actually"
2024-07-20,"i heard about that rumor too and seems quite true. given that apple will also update apple intelligence yearly, as time goes by, I think it’ll be more and more RAM intensive. i don’t what’s apple thinking about giving a “PRO” laptop an 8GB of RAM jeez"
2024-07-20,we don’t have apple store here in PH (just authorized apple resellers) I can only return it if it has a factory defect which it doesn’t have
2024-07-20,"Your base M2, if it's actually a base, has 8"
2024-07-20,good 4 u!
2024-07-20,"yeah, apparently, it’s me who’s been making the bed ;))"
2024-07-20,I wish I did the same lol
2024-07-20,RIGHT? the love-hate relationship I have with apple lol
2024-07-20,"sadly, nope, we don’t have an apple store here in ph, only authorized resellers. the only way we can return it if it has factory defect which it doesn’t have."
2024-07-20,idk what apple was thinking
2024-07-20,is it the 13” or 14” model? ‘cause the difference there is quite big
2024-07-20,maybe we don’t do the same work
2024-07-20,"not quite, we don’t have native apple store here. the only way I can return this is if it has a factory defect"
2024-07-20,idk what am I thinking when I agreed to buy this hahaha
2024-07-20,"ik, that’s some dumb shit haha!"
2024-07-20,"hmm, fair point"
2024-07-21,8GB is never “the right RAM” for any use case at the moment.
2024-07-20,wutt?
2024-07-20,except I don’t have that much money. maybe I’ll just trade it for M1 Pro or M2 Pro if lucky?
2024-07-20,only if I had the money lololol
2024-07-20,"yep, we don’t have much choice here since we don’t have a native apple store here. what u see is what u get"
2024-07-20,especially when they’re calling it “PRO”!!!
2024-07-20,do not fall into the same hole as I did!
2024-07-21,"Intel macbooks are no longer in production (since late 2021 IIRC). If you get one, it’s either clearance stock or second hand."
2024-07-20,what do u use your machine for?
2024-07-20,fuck apple
2024-07-20,"nooo, was that the base model? if yes, let’s mourn together"
2024-07-20,are u serious?? maybe apps like photoshop and such are still not optimized for M series chips? since m series chip uses different architecture than intel’s right?
2024-07-20,"yup, that’s the problem, we don’t have exchange shit here. we don’t have a native apple store"
2024-07-20,"u’r kidding, right?"
2024-07-21,"If your definition of “everything is okay” equals “watching the spinning rainbow circle every time you click something”, then yes it’s okay."
2024-07-20,"apparently a lot of adobe apps have an issue on apple silicon that are addressed (or are being addressed) in the macOS Sequoia beta(s). i have a base 14” M3 Pro for work that i was working in Lightroom CC on a while ago and it would lock up every 15-20 seconds or so. quitting and reopening lightroom would buy me a couple minutes of smooth performance but then it’d be back to tripping out again. fingers crossed macOS Sequoia actually fixes it, since adobe doesn’t appear to be doing anything about it"
2024-07-20,Huh. I wonder what's wrong. My M3 Pro with 36GB RAM and Photoshop and the 15+ filters I use with it flies like a righteous eagle.
2024-07-20,most likely
2024-07-20,thanks!!
2024-07-20,"u wouldn't want to experience it, bro"
2024-07-20,we don’t have those deals here in PH. we don’t have a native apple store here ;))
2024-07-20,someone said that even adobe suite doesn’t work quite well with M series mac. maybe it’s the architecture of m-series chip?
2024-07-20,proven ‘n tested
2024-07-20,"yup, only if apple gave it ram upgrade instead of ssd upgrade, bruh"
2024-07-20,"that’s definitely the point, apple is…"
2024-07-20,fell right through their hole ;))
2024-07-20,"thanks a lot, man!"
2024-07-20,I think the sale only exists in US. I’m from PH and we don’t even have a native apple store here ;))
2024-07-20,"never say never, jk"
2024-07-20,I’m a clown then
2024-07-20,how was it?
2024-07-20,"never considered myself a PRO since I’m a literal student, so nothing serious about the work I do. but my computer still can’t handle it smoothly ;))

I’m not justifying my purchase, I still think I’m a fool for buying it lololol"
2024-07-20,"maybe it’s the app/software optimization? if I don’t have affinity open, it runs quite well honestly even with tens of apps opens"
2024-07-20,"what am I thinking buying a computer with 8GB of ram, wth"
2024-07-20,maybe it’s the app/software optimization?
2024-07-20,"I’m from PH and we don’t have native apple store here, just authorized resellers. the only way I could return this is if it has a factory defect ;))"
2024-07-21,"well, that’s something I wouldn’t recommend xd"
2024-07-20,"I believe OP must get it replaced since it won't be upgraded. The sooner, the better."
2024-07-21,check the edit
2024-07-20,8 GB RAM was obsoleted ten years ago.
2024-07-21,should’ve made obsolete since the release of their M series chip
2024-07-21,learnt it the hard way
2024-07-21,"ohh, that’s a bummer. I heard a lot of good reviews about apple m series chip but it doesn't seem to be true (at least on the work I do)"
2024-07-21,"yep, on their PRO line-up 🤡"
2024-07-21,"yep, 8GB of RAM won’t get you anywhere regardless of how powerful of a chip u’r rocking"
2024-07-21,I would personally prioritize RAM over CPU if the RAM is not upgradable
2024-07-21,how was it? is it performing better?
2024-07-21,"u have 24GB of RAM, I have 8GB, big difference"
2024-07-21,"literally, how does apple get away with it"
2024-07-21,"hopefully, I’ll be able to trade mine for one. I think even M1 pro would perform better than my current computer"
2024-07-21,"I know I know, I really did fumble this time"
2024-07-21,let’s mourn together
2024-07-21,"same 8GB of RAM? if yes, maybe the affinity suite lacks some optimization in the m series chip"
2024-07-21,"fair point. ‘cause whenever I’m just doing school stuff (browsing, document writing, music playing, etc) my computer flies! 

maybe they shouldn’t call it a PRO after all if it can’t even perform pro tasks or even a medium workload"
2024-07-21,"hopefully, I’ll be able to trade it for older model mac’s with more RAM"
2024-07-21,someone should say it louder. 8GB OF RAM IS 8GB OF RAM!
2024-07-21,"yep, gotta learn it the hard way"
2024-07-21,"right at it, folks! lololol"
2024-07-21,"I miss him too. Tim is all for profits, change my mind"
2024-07-21,I would gladly trade mine’s for M1 with more RAM
2024-07-21,"good 4 u, but sadly, doesn't work for me"
2024-07-21,all blame an apple!!!
2024-07-21,"when I have my own money, I’ll definitely do that too"
2024-07-21,"yep, I would gladly trade mine for any m series chip with 16GB of RAM with more"
2024-07-21,"absolutely, don’t get fooled like me. 8GB of RAM is 8GB of RAM, regardless of what OS or chip u have"
2024-07-21,yep!
2024-07-21,"not quite sure, i’m not really familiar with that"
2024-07-21,"once I have money, I’ll definitely do that too. Imma have a beast of a laptop"
2024-07-21,IKR HAHAHAHAHA 8GB RAM and 1TB of storage definitely sounds insane
2024-07-21,"ohh, interesting"
2024-07-21,pretty much it
2024-07-21,"yep, learnt it the hard way"
2024-07-21,"hundred percent true! I think in today’s tech, RAM has more effect on one’s workflow than any other computer component. especially if it’s 8GB only"
2024-07-21,it’s unforgivable
2024-07-21,"yep, especially on PRO machines. how does apple get away with it so easily"
2024-07-21,"u mean MacBook, right?"
2024-07-21,"tbh, I was fooled by apple and all the 8GB RAM MBP fanboys"
2024-07-21,will do next time
2024-07-21,"36/512 with M1 Pro is a better machine, isn’t it?"
2024-07-21,the algorithm isn’t doing its job for me ;))
2024-07-21,"windows suck. I had windows as my main pc before my MBP with 16/512 configuration and 11th gen i5, and boy, I’m telling you, it’s running its fan by just opening a single chrome tab + the battery is terrible. just few things why I don’t like windows"
2024-07-21,do u think it’s a wise choice to trade my MBP and iPad air 4 for a base M3 pro MBP?
2024-07-21,the best bang for the buck!
2024-07-21,"customizing macbook here in our country isn’t available since we don’t have a native apple store. so what is in the authorized resellers inventory, that’s the only available one."
2024-07-21,what’s your computer rn? how was it?
2024-07-21,"where else are we going to buy apple products then? we don’t have a native apple store here so there’s actually no other way. 

ohh, there is, through apple website. but seems pretty hassle tbh."
2024-07-21,"right? even for MBA, it should start at 16GB and 32GB for MBP. RAM is cheap"
2024-07-21,"yuh, the love-hate relationship we have for apple"
2024-07-21,"for the nth time, we don’t have a native apple store here, just authorized resellers. so what they have in inventory is the only available ones. if they do a custom one, I’d go for 16/512 configuration"
2024-07-21,I miss steve jobs
2024-07-21,how can apple get away with it easily??
2024-07-21,"one way to solve it. but I think I’ll swap it out for a lower model with maybe 16GB of RAM, 32GB if lucky but still rocking the m series chip"
2024-07-21,"It should work fine on your computer, 32GB of RAM is miles better than 8GB"
2024-07-21,"yup! it aged like milk, literally"
2024-07-21,"oh wow, that’s a steal! may i know what do you use your computer for?"
2024-07-21,"yea, that’s why I stated at the end that it’s not for the creatives. take it with a grain of salt"
2024-07-21,wtf does that suppose to mean?
2024-07-21,"so far so good! one bummer about it is that there’s not much tutorial about it compared to photoshop. take this with a grain of salt, i’m someone who hasn’t used photoshop."
2024-07-21,LMAO
2024-07-22,"hopefully, I’ll be able to trade mine"
2024-07-22,"yeah, it’s really not fair"
2024-07-22,"totally, ig i just got scammed ;))"
2024-07-22,and what do u use your computer for?
2024-07-22,Its still called the macbook pro but it comes with the base m3 chip. Stupid apple naming since there are two variants of the macbook pro with m3 pro and m3 non-pro chip. The non-pro ones go up to 16gb of ram.
2024-07-22,"they also have MBP with base M3 chip, not M3 Pro and it starts at 8/512. the next upgrade is 8/1TB which doesn’t make sense"
2024-07-22,"ohh, I’m sorry for you man. actually, I’m only using affinity photo or any other creative apps as a hobby! I mainly use my computer for programming since I’m a CS student. Either way, as others have said, the upcoming Xcode will require at least 16GB of RAM to support the new features.

yeah, I hope I’ll be able to save money to upgrade this machine or at least trade it to something that has 16GB of RAM and rocking an M series chip.

As for the upgrade, apple is really notorious for that kind of thing. the base one starts at 8/512 then the next is 8/1TB which doesn’t make sense. I’m from PH where there’s no native apple store. so there’s no such thing as customize here, I can’t upgrade a specific thing like RAM."
2024-07-22,u’r 100% right. but putting it on a >$1700 machine is still a crime
2024-07-22,"maybe if I had the same computer as yours, this post wouldn’t exist lol, btw good 4 u!"
2024-07-22,"I actually did my research and knew for a fact that it wouldn’t be able to handle my workflow smoothly (I’m a CS student, duh). My original plan is to buy a base second-hand M2 Pro MBP. The thing is my parents won’t allow me to buy a second hand, given that I’ll be spending that MUCH money. I can’t also go for the base M3 Pro because the difference between my machine and the M3 Pro is 600 USD, at least here. My family was pressuring me into deciding what computer I’d buy, and that’s when I went with the current machine that I have. 

There are a lot more hindrances to why I ended up with the machine I have, I’m quite okay with it but if someone will be willing to trade theirs with at least 16GB RAM rocking an M series chip, I’ll be more than happy to trade mine."
2024-07-22,"at this point, I would gladly trade these nice speakers, gorgeous screen, fan that barely works and additional ports for more RAM lololol"
2024-07-23,agreed. the base should be 16GB even for MBA. no one deserves to be paying that much money for an 8GB machine. or at least make it upgradable after the purchase lol
2024-07-23,absolutely
2024-07-23,ikrr
2024-09-16,i still haven’t
2024-07-20,"the shade to Adobe LMAO. good thing I avoid using Adobe suite hahaha, Affinity suite better + it’s a one-time purchase!"
2024-07-20,"fair take. speaking of fans, even though I do a lot of creative work, I think the fans never turned on yet 🤔"
2024-07-20,"sadly, yes. idek why would apple put 8gb on their pro lines jeez"
2024-07-20,"for the nth time, we don’t have a native apple store here, only authorized apple resellers. the only way I could return this is if it has a factory defect which it doesn’t have."
2024-07-20,yep! maybe the base M3 MBP is for folks like u!
2024-07-21,most of the software you described are not very intensive on mac. professional photo editing software like Affinity photo and Photoshop (which uses 4gb of ram on idle) are quite heavy on mac so 8gb is not enough and it’s the kind of software that will have a huge difference on 8gb vs 16gb ram.
2024-07-20,"Maybe if you're rolling in cash, otherwise this is horrible  advice"
2024-07-21,"well, it’s not cheap??? or maybe I’m just poor, idk"
2024-07-20,"\*M3 Max

Not a pro max

Lol I bought 96gb just to be sure, even 36gb can be not quite enough nowadays. My basic editing workflow would have humbled 36gb of RAM, I can't imagine what my most complex workflows would do to it."
2024-07-20,"And depends on your need, as Air can only have one external monitor."
2024-07-20,lol
2024-07-20,I’m pathetic then
2024-07-22,"maybe apple isn’t the only one to blame, the consumer as well, isn’t it?"
2024-07-20,ig I’m a fool
2024-07-21,"yep, feel sorry for myself"
2024-07-20,"ohh, is it? I’m thinking if I should trade it for base 14” M1 Pro MBP 16/512, would it be a worse experience given that M3 has better CPU than M1 Pro?"
2024-07-21,then why are u here?
2024-07-20,$1799 gets you the 14” MacBook Pro M3 Pro 16GB/512GB.
2024-07-20,Is that config good for Photoshop/Premiere/Final cut? I'm interested in buying that one but I can't find infos online. Ty!
2024-07-21,Yeah how's that spec. I'm planning to get that for college.
2024-07-21,"It's kind of a tradeoff. The pro has a higher quality display, better speakers, some extra ports, an SD slot and a cooling fan. 


Also, while there's no supporting evidence on paper to say the Air is a more fragile machine, I've seen way more damaged Air displays than Pro and from a historical standpoint, I see way more Pros than Airs still in use after a few years.



8gb RAM still sucks but what I'm trying to say is at the lower rungs, you're going to be making sacrifices.



Used market might be best if viable in your location. The M1 Pro 14 and 16 really dropped in cash value over the past year to the point you might be able to find one less than $1000 if you keep your eye out. They're old enough to have dings and such and that AppleCare+ is starting to expire, etc."
2024-07-20,No fan and worse display 🤷‍♂️
2024-07-20,The MacBook Air Plus
2024-07-21,"This isn’t the base model MacBook Pro, it’s an upgraded Air. The base model MacBook Pro has the M3 Pro CPU (not the base CPU that the Air uses that’s in this garbage) and 16GB RAM/512GB SSD."
2024-07-21,"Like I said, it’s not a real Pro. It’s a model marketed as being a Pro targeting people who don’t know better. Literal false advertising."
2024-07-24,"Yes it does, a display doesn't make it Pro, having a professional level CPU (Pro/Max), decent amount of RAM, useable storage instead of barely enough for the OS, more than 2 USB-C ports and the ability to run more than one external monitor. Not to mention that it has a smaller battery than the real Pro models as well."
2024-07-20,even on 16gb there will be alot of swap with your workflow. Im doing programming with alot of tabs open and running some vm and my 16gb mbp already use about 17gb of swap. my com is still usable.
2024-07-20,You may still be in the return period.
2024-07-20,"Try and return it asap you’d be surprised they might make an exception if you tell them you just need a better machine. 

And yeah debuggers also eat a lot of ram. You should have 16gb or more if you’re doing photoshop stuff or programming."
2024-07-20,"Sorry bro, 8gb was good ten years ago, not these days. I bought a 32gb m2 mbp last year. It should last a while, but you never know the days."
2024-07-21,Can't you return it if it's been under 2 weeks or something like that? I got stuck with this slow as balls iMac for a few years and you don't want to go through that.
2024-07-22,yes you did but can't you return it within 14 days?

2024-07-20,I read the early BS that you didn’t need as much RAM and tried an 8 but even with 16 M1 I’m feeling its limits and looking forward to an M4 refresh. I’d go for a 16 air before an 8 pro.
2024-07-20,"Yeah, anything is better than what you have (obviously meaning an M series chip with AT LEAST 16 GBs of RAM)

If you can snag an M1 Pro with 16 GBs I’d go for it. Even if the storage on it is low, it’s still a much more viable option."
2024-07-20,Break it down the laptop or make some fault on laptop and return is saying that it had defects when you bought it from the shop.  Simple
2024-07-21,Dang that sucks
2024-07-21,"Yes.

The M3 is maybe 30% faster than the M1 at pure computation.

But having too little RAM can make things 10x slower. (Note that extra RAM doesn't make things faster. Just too little RAM slows things down.)

So investing in more RAM is by far the better use of any money you have beyond the absolute base model."
2024-07-21,"Yes just trade it, your storage is going to fucking die with 8GB RAM. The swap is going to be insane."
2024-07-20,"Even though swap is better than it was before, you still want to minimally rely on swap.  Swap is not a feature it's a compromise."
2024-07-21,"I purchased a MacBook Pro in 2019 with intel and had 8 GB just for two college classes, English & some dumb gen ed requirement and it would breathe loudly and heat up when I used Microsoft Word and had like 4 tabs open after about 10-15 minutes. I was constantly uninstalling apps and trying different things to make it run better but I ended up using my iPad to take notes and type with the keyboard you can buy for them until I caved and got a new MacBook Pro with the M3 chip last month. Now that I’m in my senior year I couldn’t take just using the iPad anymore or my cranky 8 GB 2019 oven disguised as a Mac. I don’t do much other than research, read my textbooks, type documents, and watch lectures, and 8 GB was nowhere near enough for me. If you aren’t a student you could maybe get away with 8 GB but other than that noooo."
2024-07-22,"Yeah, I don't know what ram is. I just know 8 gigs is cheaper than 16 and I saved money because of it. It does exactly what I need it to do. I check emails and Facebook. Good enough for me."
2024-07-21,"How is having to micromanage ram a better user experience than just buying a Windows laptop with his budget?
I like macs, I really do, but they're a luxury product."
2024-07-20,"Also, with the M Series Macs we are dealing with Unified Memory. This means your CPU and GPU share the same memory, whereas before you would have had separate memory for each. So in the past you would have had an 8GB Mac with maybe 2GB of video memory, so 10GB in total. Now you have 8GB total! so you have to subtract the memory needed for GPU before you see how much you have left for everything else. 
Apple have tried to persuade us that this isn’t a problem but I’m not convinced. I’ll be buying as much memory as I can afford going forward."
2024-07-23,"I feel like you are blaming Apple for your ignorance. 8gb works for light workloads, which your use case is not. Swap works well but shouldn’t be relied on, especially when you are buying a new device. Why would you buy a device that you will, at best, have the minimum amount of ram at day 1? You should buy more ram and rely on swap 6 years later when programs use more resources."
2024-07-21,"This is an idiotic comment. 16 is low these days, particularly with a bloated OS like Mac OS. There's also no concept of vram so things like high streams are going to choke. 

https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/10/8gb-ram-in-m3-macbook-pro-proves-the-bottleneck/

Sure you might not have 20 tabs in Lightroom, but that kind of power is going to become the expectation as the OS updates, and as the internet evolves. Particularly since JavaScript is having a renaissance and it performs most of its programming client side. Phones will get away with it for awhile because they aren't running as many concurrent processes."
2024-07-20,"And btw, I keep seeing this ad on Reddit that Safari uses fewer resources. When I open only Safari, one tab, it still shows 8.7GB RAM used. Why does a browser with one tab use 8GB memory. That's insane.

The more I use this computer, the more qualms I have with it. Sure, the Apple ecosystem is great, but I don't understand why they made a device that's smooth, slippery, and heavy. This is just asking to be dropped. My work Dell laptop is rubberized, i7, 16GB RAM, and so light that I never worry about dropping it. I wouldn't hesitant to pick it up with one hand. The MBP I wouldn't dare try to lift with one hand in fear of dropping the damn thing."
2024-07-21,yeah I wish I was kidding
2024-07-21,"Well, I traded it in when the M1 Pro came out, and the M1 Pro one bricked on me overnight a few weeks ago lol. I still have an M1 iMac w 8GB going though if you'd like me to test anything.

Idk in full detail what's going on, but a lot of people seem to have this same issue: [https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255211312?sortBy=best](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255211312?sortBy=best)"
2024-07-20,"In China it easily to found technician able to upgrade ram of MacBook.

2024-07-20,"Maybe, you sell it as quickly as possible and you would get a little loss, buy new one with 24 of ram and storage 512"
2024-07-20,"Standard settings should be ok.

I've seen some guys complaining about performance who set RAM usage to 100% with Photoshop or Parallels 100% for the Windows VM, so it was clear that the machine gets sluggy.

Combination XCode and Affinity might be too much for 8GB RAM, sorry for you."
2024-07-20,"yeah I agree. are you using affinity photo 1 or 2? I was able to use it with 3 documents open at once, safari with YouTube videos in the background and other apps running"
2024-07-20,"Both have had years to work out the kinks, and generally speaking, Adobe has had optimized apps ready for major chip and OS changes. For the fees it charges, that company really can't tell its customers that they may have to wait a couple of months for full functionality. 

Affinity being so much smaller, I'm sure its people are always scrambling to catch up and correct, giving little time to focus on optimization. Dozens of people instead of hundreds working. While Affinity is trying to give Adobe a run for its money, I don't know whether the company will ever be able to build an adequate customer base in a David and Goliath situation."
2024-07-21,"Its better to buy last generation high end products if you don't have a buck for a newest one. Base models are good only with cars, mostly. I got M2 Max 38c / 64gb / 2tb for the price of base model M3 Max. I don't get the whole apple fanboy community defending such a pieceofshit config. 8gb were quite something in core2duo iMac but it was fifteen years ago."
2024-07-21,Yea i read the other comments
2024-07-21,"I finally managed to upgrade though. Bought the m3pro for the 18gb ram in November. It’s been perfect. If i had bought the 16gb m1 mbp, id have more money in my pocket today. I hope you find a way to get a more suitable machine"
2024-07-21,"Don’t get me wrong I’m not defending Apple.
I think with copilot plus PCs on the windows side now having 16gb base RAM we finally will see Apple bump up the base configuration to 16gb as well"

2024-07-20,"Yes, I forgot to mention the speakers. Incredible! I had M1 Air and upgraded to M1 Pro 14”. I am very happy with my decision."
2024-07-20,running any machine learning or ai stuff will require a lot of ram because you need to load a lot of data into the ram and train it. i tried running a local model and it already takes about 4gb of ram

2024-07-20,The 13!
2024-07-20,"Damn, I don’t quite know what to tell you. That’s a bummer :/ 

The only recommendation I can make is if you are doing work close out the background tabs. Or another thing you could do is pick up an M2 Mac Mini with 16GB of ram and use that for your more complicated tasks and keep the MacBook for portable work+everything else.

Or see if anyone wants to buy the MacBook? Then reinvest the money into a 18GB version."
2024-07-20,You had enough money to spend about $200 less or whatever for the 8/1tb base M3 MBP so I think you can afford it.  That or wait till you do.  Don’t settle for something and then end up regretting your purchase when it’s too late to return.  That’s the worst thing you can do.
2024-07-21,I meant I've had the intel one for a while but the 16GB ram on this late 2018 is still decent for apps.
2024-07-20,"Honestly nothing to justify the M3 pro and amount of RAM, I just wanted a Mac that would be for the long run since they can never be upgraded again nowadays. Just medium user, like heavy web browsing, lots of tabs open, video editing, and some code development on Xcode."
2024-07-20,Just never buy base model MBP
2024-07-20,"This what I thought, someone with more knowledge about this than me can weigh in. Now I have to quit my apps and use a “memory scrubber” before ai open any big intensive files (and there are a few of them)"

2024-07-22,"Research before buying helps. Some reviewers are quick to champion just about any product they're borderline ""shilling"" for, while others will point out deficiencies. It pays off to be able to determine which are which.

2024-07-20,"I think base 14” M1 Pro or M2 Pro would be a better deal! But yeah, more RAM is better than “pro” chassis. I’d definitely go for the air with 16/512 than pro with 8/512"
2024-07-20,"I’d say not if it can’t even handle affinity photo, I got the M2 Max, 32gb/1TB, handles FCPX, Photoshop etc., etc., with ease, but the better spec you can get, (even if it’s a stretch financially), the better in the long run"
2024-07-21,"better than this base M3 MacBook “PRO”. as someone said earlier, base M3 MBP is a MBA in disguise"
2024-07-21,"yeah, the display and speaker on this machine just… to say it’s wonderful is an understatement. but yeah, I was thinking of trading it to older pro machines with at least 16GB RAM and with an M series chip"
2024-07-20,"haven’t heard the fans turned on since I bought it. and for the display, can’t argue with that"
2024-07-21,but still this is a model in apple store right? and it says MBPRO?
2024-07-20,Same situation as you. Have a M1 Pro 16gb. Are you looking to upgrade?

2024-07-20,A lot*
2024-07-20,"I’m from PH and we don’t have a native Apple Store here (just authorized resellers), the only way I can return it is if it has a factory defect (which it doesn’t have) so returning it is really not an option ;))"

2024-07-21,"yep, welcome to a third-world country"
2024-07-21,"yeah, I think RAM is more important in the works I do (creative works) more RAM would be noticeable difference on my workflow vs a faster CPU"
2024-07-21,"yep, some folks said that RAM would affect the things that I do more than CPU"
2024-07-21,"Why are you bringing up intel MacBook here… 8 GB is not enough for intel chips yes but the apple silicon chip is leagues above them, not even close. You do realize the M1 MBA was so revolutionary it beat intel so far ahead they haven’t even caught up to the efficiency of the M1 MBA, 4 years later. M1 MBA had no fan and still beat intel in performance and battery life. 

I used the base M1 MBA with 8 GB of ram as a college student for 4 years without any problem and so have many others. The major population is not the average redditors"
2024-07-21,"xcode? (or any other apple only software)

i'm not referring to OP, i'm saying in general."
2024-07-21,"apple is really anti-consumer, if only they let consumer upgrade their RAM on their own it wouldn’t be a problem, but they don't. they’re all for profit"
2024-07-21,"You do realize there are millions of base MacBook users who are happy with their 8 GB configuration? Sure, if they increased their workload or in the future the websites are more taxing  then maybe their Mac will slow down a bit, and it's okay. You need more ram, buy more ram. 8 GB is totally enough.

The real issue and what you should be angry about is the exorbitant price of memory upgrade from 8 to 16, not whether 8 GB is enough or not."
2024-07-21,"Mac OS will load as much stuff on ram as possible. It doesn't try to save ram If you have it. Load it up and watch your memory pressure. It will compress and manage perfectly well. If is allowing it to stay in ram till you need it. You'll be green. The plain math of counting ram is not a true representation of how fast it manages it.  What tab were you running that sucked 8 gb, sounds like a memory leak.  I have never seen that much from a tab, seems like it's a weird site or keeps loading things/memory leak. 

Apple has always been a design focused company. Form and function. They last longer than most other oem computers and end up being cheaper per year. 

I have no qualms with my machine. I made so many cool things on it and it handles everything. It keeps killing it for me, so I keep taking care of it."

There might be a memory leak on the website you’re visiting"
2024-07-21,"was actually considering trading for a windows laptop with at least 16GB of RAM (upgradable) and an i7 chip. do u think it’ll be a better computer for my work? I do video editing, photo editing, UI/UX design, programming, and some other creative stuff."

I tried, only 4070 laptops can do it - and i'm not gonna buy those bricks.  
Waiting for price drop after m4 arrival"
2024-09-25,"That 8 gb of usage is not from the browser, Mac OS manages RAM differently than windows, it loads as much as posible in order to make the RAM useful, but when programs start asking for more memory, it start moving things around.

When it comes to Mac OS you should only keep an eye on the ""Memory pressure"", that´s the real metric when it comes to RAM on Mac OS"
2024-07-21,I feel sorry for you son
2024-07-21,"if it’s okay with you, can you check how’s the memory pressure (green, yellow, or red) when you open demanding apps? like at what point will the memory pressure turn red?

my machine’s memory pressure turns red whenever I have about 10 tabs open on safari, affinity photo, and a music playing in the background.

based on my testing, it’s not the affinity photo that’s causing the memory pressure to go bad, it’s safari."
2024-07-20,"Can’t be done anymore in M series, the unified memory is within SoC, meaning that any upgrade you’ll have to get whole different SoC"
2024-07-20,"For older macbooks maybe. But for M series, it can only upgrade the SSD (and by doing that, it's voiding the warranty). The RAM chip for M series is within the same area of the processor its self, and so far no one been able to upgrade the RAM for M series."
2024-07-20,do u have an idea what are the compromises of that method?
2024-07-20,"hmm, not really an option for me to upgrade since I’m still a student (budget issues) maybe I should trade it for 14” M1 Pro MBP 16/512?"
2024-07-21,"affinity photo 2. how many layers do your documents have? mine has barely 20 layers in just one document and it’s stuttering like crazy, I’m just switching between safari and affinity"

2024-07-20,"maybe a PROfessional movie/TV show watcher and PROfessional music listener, because the base M3 MBP is really great at those!"
2024-07-20,Of which the M3 has one. You only get two fans if you buy the M3 Pro or M3 Max
2024-07-20,"speaking of fans, I haven’t heard the fans turned on yet lmao"
2024-07-20,"Apple is already saying *""Xcode 16 includes predictive code completion, powered by a machine learning model specifically trained for Swift and Apple SDKs. Predictive code completion requires a Mac with Apple silicon and 16GB of unified memory, running macOS 15.""*

So the latest (base model) Macbook **Pro** can't even run features that are coming this fall. Talk about planned obsolescence."
2024-07-20,"is it the base 14” M2 Pro MBP? if yes, then yeah. I heard that the base M3 MBP is supposed to replace the 13” M2 MBP."
2024-07-20,"Base 14""? or base 13""? M2 Pro 14"" had 16gb"
2024-07-20,maybe the affinity is just not optimized for m series chip?
2024-07-20,thanks a lot dude! do u think swapping it for base 14” MBP 16/512 would perform better than my current one
2024-07-21,"not really that simple actually, but fair point! 

i’m from PH and we don’t have a native apple store here. so the upgrade thing isn't really available here. what they have in inventory is the only one available. we can not upgrade piece by piece"

2024-07-20,what exactly are parallel programs and what are the examples of it?
2024-07-20,"meh! lol take it with a grain of salt but my thought is that it’s a mix of that and adobe simply not optimizing their software for apple silicon. gotta keep in mind we’ve had intel chips for decades, apple silicon is still “new”(ish) in the grand scheme of things"

2024-07-20,thanks for the advice!
2024-07-21,"well, I know for a fact that it’s not enough for me. but there are a few reasons why I get it anyway. one thing is money, if only I had the money, I wouldn’t settle for this one. check the edit also, maybe you’ll get more context as to why returning and upgrading stuff isn’t really not an option"

2024-07-22,"ohh, right. maybe it all depends on what we use our computers for. but either way, I still think 8GB of RAM on a >$1600 machine is a crime. especially when u know how cheap the RAM is."
2024-07-21,I will willingly do that lol
2024-07-21,"yep! felt like all my money was wasted. hopefully, I’ll be able to trade it for a lower model with more RAM but still rocking an M series chip!"
2024-07-21,"ohh okay, thank u man!"
2024-07-22,"yeah, even for MBA, 8GB is not enough, what more on PRO, right? plus RAM isn’t cheap, the cost of upgrades is ridiculously expensive lol"
2024-07-21,"yup! I think the base M3 could handle that easily. but if you’re planning to keep it for more than 5 years, I doubt it’ll be able to keep up."
2024-07-22,what can I say lololol
2024-07-22,"yea, I can confirm that lol"
2024-07-23,"yup, works fine whenever I don’t use serious apps"
2024-07-22,"we don’t have a native apple store here, the MBA is either 8/256 or 8/512 also, we can’t customize our computers. so I don’t have much choice."
2024-07-23,"I did my research lol and my knowledge of computers is broad enough to know that 8GB is not enough for my workload (I’m a CS student, duh). 

few reasons are; that we don’t have a native apple store here, we don’t have the capacity to upgrade certain parts of the machine (i.e. RAM, SSD, cores, etc.) we mostly have the built one on the apple store, in the base M3 case, either 8/512 or 8/1TB. 

Secondly; my original plan is to go for a 14” M2 Pro MBP. The thing is there’s no brand new. My family won’t let me buy a second-hand computer for that MUCH money.

Third, I can’t also go for base M3 Pro, the price difference here in our country is around 600 USD which is a lot given that we’re a third-world country.

Lastly, I’m still a student so I don’t have much choice or money to choose whatever computer I want.

My family was frustrated at the time of purchasing my computer ‘cause I literally can’t decide whether I’d go for the machine that I have right now."
2024-07-20,"Affinity has a 6 month trial on version 2 , and might still be half price for the universal license for Mac, iPad, & windows."

2024-07-25,"if you only do office tasks and nothing else ya then 8gb of ram is enough. in fact most of your workflow were already quite fast on my 2013 macbook pro 8gb of ram, which is a 11 year old laptop. so of cos ur m1 mac can handle it well. it was only laggy the moment i open photoshop"

You cannot use two external displays with it, it has one fan, less ports, base model CPU (not the Pro or Max). It is not a real MacBook Pro. It’s marketed to idiots who cannot afford a real MacBook Pro but don’t want to be seen using an Air."
2024-07-20,"not anytime soon. my laptop is still quite fast for my needs in college (in CS where even an M1 MBA 16/512 is sufficient). Might upgrade when i graduate and start working which is like 4 years from now.

16gb ram with swap is still alot faster and usable than 8gb with swap"
2024-07-21,"""Swap is indistinguishable from RAM""

Til you burn through the unpublished, but present endurance rating of the flash cells. Then you have a dead computer that can't be fixed. 

I HATE soldered on RAM and soldered on SSDs. 

Did I mention I hate them?"

2024-07-20,"Unethical tip:

Have a second person SSH into your machine and send random reboot commands while you’re at the authorized dealer. Tell them it’s a defect and they need to accept the return.

Or write a small bash script that starts on login and randomly reboots every 1-120 seconds"
2024-07-20,Damn. Sorry dude.
2024-07-21,"Oh what that's so lame. I'm going to be honest - I got an M1 but with an expanded graphics card and RAM. Overall.... it's not amazing for 3D stuff. Since there's virtually no games for the platform it's hard to tell, but the few 3D workloads I've had it to it's been sort of mediocre, and just getting more RAM might not even fix your problem."
2024-07-22,yeah you messed up 😅
2024-07-20,"RAM is more important than anything else. I would rather work on a 10-year-old box with plenty of RAM than on a brand new one where I have to rely on swap memory. I had projects where 256 GB wasn't enough, and an old machine with 512 GB was running circles around the shiny new box with 256 GB."
2024-07-21,"Well yeah, obviously. Having more than 8GB RAM is way more important than your CPU, which is already extremely fast on the M1 Pro, and will be more than fast enough for you.

Just get more RAM, it's way more important than a 30% faster CPU"
2024-07-21,"Ah, my apologies I honestly just skimmed and saw basically “8 GB is good for anyone” and it sent off alarm bells. You’re right, I definitely got up too early this morning!"
2024-07-22,Dual boot hackintosh ;)
2024-07-21,"That’s a separate issue but not unrelated issue. The problem is you have fallen into the unified memory trap. Before the M Series it was clearer what types of GPU & VRAM you needed for graphics intensive applications, most of those apps would have minimum specs published. That allowed anyone using their Mac for photo or video editing to know what spec Mac they would need. As someone who has stated they are doing photo editing you will be claiming a significant portion of your 8GB unified memory for Affinity Photo which leaves you with a few GB for everything else. It is difficult to say how much memory would actually be enough in your case, 16GB might work, but if it doesn’t your only option with the base M3 is to upgrade to 24GB. 

Apple selling the base M3 as a MacBook Pro, I think is misleading for them to do, imo any MBP they sell should have at least a Pro chip in it! Otherwise it is an Air in disguise effectively, as some people have already mentioned.  When you look at what I consider to be the true MBP’s (those with the Pro or Max chips) they all start with 18GB as their minimum spec now.  That is really what Apple is saying is the minimum spec for a pro user these days, but they hide it from casual buyers with the base M3 MBP range."
2024-07-21,"It isn't 😂 for this year maybe. Not a few years from now. Mac laptops used to be an investment you kept for far longer than that. My 2016 is just starting to disappoint.

It doesn't just slow when you max it out, it crawls, and keep in mind it's swapping with an equally skimpy SSD where the OS already is eating up most of the space and growing by the year. Why I posted the link, the 8gb was 4-5 times slower. That gets unusable when browsing, the apps tested that power is mostly needed when applying effects. When the OS, websites , streaming services up their minimum you're talking about a delay for your mouse to move across the screen.

A computer as expensive as a Mac shouldn't be that way. $300 Chromebooks have 8gb ram. Dell latitudes with 32gb ram and a 1tb and a swift processor cost $1200. Don't like windows, install Mint, since Mac has even fewer options at this point. A Linux laptop would at least have the ram and power to run games and Office to over wine or a VM.

I get you're a hopeless shill caught in an awful sunk cost fallacy. This comment is for potential buyers. BTW my nearly 80 year old parents got these and are absolutely miserable. So yeah I'm mad that they got fleeced and feel all kinds of guilt for turning them into apple 20 years ago, at this point they are kinda stuck with the interface."
2024-07-21,"Intel is not the way to go nowadays, Apples ram and drive are much faster. Your computer is fantastic for it. I use an M1 Pro and it handles massive mixes and masters for albums, heavy photoshop. Have you not pushed your machine? Don't stare at ram while you're working. Memory pressure is the metric you want to check."
2024-07-21,"Alright yeah, trying it now- I have

* Chrome with 12 tabs (LinkedIn, Best Buy, Perplexity, ChatGPT, Amazon, Reddit, a few other shopping tabs)
* Discord
* VS Code with a basic React Native website
* Final Cut Pro, dragged in a few short 4k videos
* Apple Music (Apple Music is always a little buggy, kinda wish they'd fix that)

it doesn't feel laggy, gonna check the memory pressure now

memory pressure is yellow

edit: gonna try Safari in case that's worse than Chrome. It shouldn't be, but it might be

edit again: added a few tab of Safari. Memory pressure is still yellow in the graph, but it's at 7.15GB/8GB RAM now, so SWAP should start if I push it a little more"
2024-07-20,To do such ram upgrade would void MacBook's warranty.
2024-07-20,"Yeah, I would rather get an older chip but more memory."
2024-07-21,You may be upvoted for your cynicism and sarcasm but that doesn’t make it a productive post. The fact remains: Not all things are for you. Your attitude is childlike.
2024-07-20,Me either.
2024-07-20,That's because it isn't needed on the base M chips and does not make a difference in day to day performance.
2024-07-21,Apple gave me $610 for my 2 year old MBA M2 which brought down my new MBP to about $1700 from $2400
2024-07-20,"I looked at all the vids doing the testing and none do Adobe apps, they do compiling software like for programming etc. so it may actually be that Adobe is just a memory hog."
2024-07-22,"What I meant was if you have affinity photo open, don't open anything else with it. I often have parallel  programs open like xcode, Docker, pycharm, vscode, multiple terminals, and browsers. Even on 16GB RAM, the MBP would have a tough time running all these in parallel. Hence why I went for 32GB one, and that too a 5 year old Intel MBP."
2024-07-20,makes sense
2024-07-20,Your welcome!
2024-07-21,"That's alright. You can still sell it and get an M1 or M2 with at least 16 GB RAM. Otherwise, the more time you use, the more its price will drop, and so is your productivity. 

Time is money, and money is everything."
2024-07-21,"I believe if Apple authorizes the resellers, they will facilitate you in a similar way as Apple would."
2024-07-21,"That’s simply not true, manufacturers go for cheapest cost. That’s why cars use screens when most people want knobs/buttons, things break instead of needing repair, and air travel is worsening with every visit. $$ > customer satisfaction"
2024-07-23,"Are you talking about RAM in general or the specific type of RAM Apple uses? You also realize that Apple sells a hell of a lot of Macs so bumping up the base storage means not just that they pay a bit more for RAM for that one computer, but they actually double the amount of RAM that their base models need, which drives up the cost of RAM they pay for all models including their base models, which also drives up the cost of RAM for other company's products because Apple has now had a significant impact on how much RAM is available for sale.

You need to stop complaining, open activity monitor, so you can see what's hogging RAM. Quit Chrome when you're using the Affinity apps, and get back to doing creative stuff on the Mac instead of complaining that you didn't do your research before buying a computer. Also, just in general stop using Chrome it's a huge RAM hog."
2024-07-21,"MacBooks are extremely expensive here in Brazil, I was able to sell this 9yo MBP 2015 for $570. Then asked a friend to bring me this new M3 from the US.

2024-07-22,What?

2024-07-21,"agreed. the base M3 MBP is the replacement of the previous 13” MBP. it’s quite alarming how apple markets it as a PRO when it can’t even perform moderate tasks effectively. it’s all about profit, they want people to spend money upgrading specific things which is crazy expensive. they should’ve given the base M3 at least 16GB of RAM."
2024-07-21,"yep, I have affinity photo open together with safari with < 10 tabs open and music playing in the background. I checked the activity monitor and the RAM pressure is in yellow.

the thing is, if my affinity photo is closed and I have tens of apps open, the memory pressure seems to handle it pretty well."
2024-07-21,"Ok, a few more videos in Final Cut Did it- SWAP jumped to 5GB lol and things did start lagging. Looks like my hard drive was almost full, so it can't do any more SWAP lol

edit: Final Cut Pro crashed"
2024-07-21,"woah, and that’s on M1 with 8GB right? how the heck ur machine handle apps better? I think there’s definitely a memory leak going on with mine. thanks for the effort man, appreciate it!"
2024-07-20,"As long as it's under warranty, I wouldn't do it."
2024-07-21,"maybe if they didn’t call it a PRO, your argument would be valid"
2024-07-21,"too bad we don’t have an apple store here, so there’s no way I could sell this to Apple. the only way I can get another machine is by swapping. i’m still a student so I don’t really have an income."
2024-07-20,"what’s with all these benchmark tests, hopefully, they’ll do more real-world use"
2024-07-21,It’s not only Adobe. Seems to me that all apps consume significantly more memory on Apple silicon. Even Apple apps.
2024-07-22,"ohh I see, thanks!"
2024-07-21,bullseye! thanks mann
2024-07-21,"i hope that’s the case, but yeah, tried doing it and sadly, there’s no chance I can return this ;))"
2024-07-23,"for the nth time, I did my research lol and my knowledge of computers is broad enough to know that 8GB is not enough for my workload (I’m a CS student, duh).

few reasons are; that we don’t have a native apple store here, we don’t have the capacity to upgrade certain parts of the machine (i.e. RAM, SSD, cores, etc.) we mostly have the built one on the apple store, in the base M3 case, either 8/512 or 8/1TB.

Secondly; my original plan is to go for a 14” M2 Pro MBP. The thing is there’s no brand new. My family won’t let me buy a secondhand computer for that MUCH money.

Third, I can’t also go for base M3 Pro, the price difference here in our country is around
600 USD which is a lot given that we’re a third-world country.

Lastly, I’m still a student so I don’t have much choice or money to choose whatever computer I want.

My family was frustrated at the time of purchasing my computer ‘cause I literally can’t decide whether l’d go for the machine that l have right now."
2024-07-21,that’s quite clever hahaha!
2024-07-22,"yup, the only configuration they have is either 8/512 or 8/1TB"
2024-07-20,Yeah it is 💀
2024-07-20,Is it not still in the return window?
2024-07-20,"Well, that's a maxed out MBA and I don't think I could go higher :("
2024-07-20,"for creative work: if you are using blender, an M3 pro 18/512 will be much faster as M3 has dedicated ray tracing cores

for programming work: M1 pro 16/512 will smoke your M3 8/1024

also hello fellow SEA cs student"
2024-07-21,"I personally would go for 32gb. With my creative work 18gb on the m3 was barely cutting it, massive showdowns when working even with fairly conservative 4gb photoshop beauty retouch documents.

I returned my m3 18gb to purchase a 14 in M1 Max 64/2tb for just a few hundred more than what the m3 was."
2024-07-21,"Honestly graphic processing isn't really my thing, I just tried using this 3D visualizer of a room and the entire thing started lagging and getting choppy, which kind of surprised me because I'd gotten the latest Apple graphics card (at the time) and 16GB of ram.

\\I'd ask in a subreddit with people that use a lot of the same software you use, and ask them what works for them."
2024-07-21,"No, that's not enterprise server-level. Those were just basic workstations in my industry over a decade ago. And I didn't say he should get that amount of RAM. I just made a simple analogy."
2024-07-21,"In photoshop you can control how much ram is used and save some for the system. Check to see if Affinity photo has memory management. It should if it's worth its salt. 

As far as the 8gb model goes it would def be worth reselling and getting an M1 Pro with more ram. I have an M1 Pro with 32gb and ram aside, the cpu can do every creative app I throw out it with one hand tied behind its back"
2024-07-21,but it still does a better job than mine. apple really should fix the memory leak issue ASAP
2024-07-23,"It's a couple things. I'm not a hardware expert, but

- Desktops are larger and can accommodate better cooling equipment, even if they're thin and such like the new iMac  
- ""running at once"" is a little misleading, because MacOS probably does some sort of hibernate function on windows you don't have open. I know for sure web browsers do this  
- there's a difference between allocating and actually using RAM  
- SWAP is sooooooo much faster on modern hard drives"
2024-07-21,"You don't need to be physically near an apple store, I did mail in trade in to Apple."
2024-07-22,">ohh I see, thanks!

You're welcome!"
2024-07-21,"Last week she bought me a MacBook Pro M1 13 inch 16/512 from Amazon Renewed for $790 , but when it arrived it had some scratches , a dent and the battery health was at 93% even with only 63 cycles. The next day Amazon started Prime Day deals then I saw this brand new M3 for $849 , and I decided to return it and get the M3 , since the M1 is already 3 years old and had no warranty."
2024-07-22,"In that case, does what you do need MacOS? Because if you're going to spend that much might as well get something that's adequately functional"
2024-07-20,"what’s return window? we don’t have native apple store here, just resellers"
2024-07-20,"I haven’t tried 3D works so I really don’t use Blender. I mainly use Figma for UI/UX design, Affinity Photo for photo manipulation, and Affinity Designer for vector works, uhm, that’s pretty much the software I use. 

Given that I can’t afford the M3 Pro 18/512, will the M1 Pro 16/512 still beat my M3 8/1TB for the works/software I’m using?

2024-07-22,thankss!
2024-07-21,"512 *gigabytes* of RAM is not the spec of a basic workstation today let alone over 10 years ago. 

If you’re working in a field that has that level as a basic workstation then it’s not something that is a reasonable analogy - it’s so far from the norm. 

It’s like saying in my field as a Formula 1 driver I found a big difference between these two cars, and somehow trying to apply that to the features of a Toyota Camry."
2024-07-21,"ohh okay, thanks man!"

2024-07-20,The window time allowed to return the product and get your full amount back. They may charge a fee but if it’s all good and you got a nice employee that’s chill they usually let that slide

sup, i’m from singapore xd"
2024-07-21,"Yo I’m a UX designer and use Figma as my main software. I have been using a 2019 MacBook Pro 16gb 256gb storage for quite a few years. I literally just upgraded to the m3 pro 18gb/512gb on Friday. Didn’t get a chance to really run much software, but in general using the new hardware is super smooth. Everything is gliding like butter. The real test will be next week when I have it fully set up, but at a quick glance it’s been nice. 

All this to say that I have been using an older MacBook Pro that has done quite well. Sure it’s slow sometimes, and the fan sounds like a jet engine, but it’s gets the job done. So even if you don’t have the best hardware out there you will still be fine for a decent while. 

Can you return the laptop and upgrade though? That’s what I would do. You only got it two weeks ago. If not then maybe you could sell it for like $50-100 less than what you paid and then uograde to the m3 pro. I know it’s more expensive, but you will end up needing a new laptop 2-3 years earlier than if you just got something better now. So in the long run you’re not only saving money, but also getting better performance for your day to day"
2024-07-20,"in the context of 8gb M3 vs 16gb M1 Pro. M1 Pro will win. of cos if it’s M3 16gb, then M3 will win"

2024-07-20,yayyyyy! :'(
2024-07-20,"this is from someone who hasn’t tried adobe photoshop, so take it with a grain of salt.

let me start with the issues I had first. The only issue I had was the learning curve. Compared to photoshop, affinity photo doesn’t have a lot of tutorials on YT, which is kind of a bummer since I actually don’t have an idea what those tools and buttons do. plus if I want to do some specific design, most of the time, the tutorials are using photoshop.

the good thing is, that almost every feature in photoshop is available on affinity photo, so what I do is learn all the tools and where they belong. after that, I watch a photoshop tutorial and did the same thing on affinity. they’re like the same software, just with different tool placement and tool names.

aside from that, I never had any problems with affinity! I think it’s definitely better value for everyone, especially for us students who still don’t have an income.

this is your sign to buy it! it’s currently on sale, 50% off. you’ll get all the apps on all platforms (Mac, Windows, and iPad) it’s a steal!"
2024-07-21,thanks man!
2024-07-20,thank you so much for the detailed write up!
2025-02-22,It was one of the coolest consumer gadgets I’ve ever seen or used in my life. But I ain’t paying no $4000 for it lol. That’s what went wrong.
2025-02-22,It was just simply too expensive to gain mass adoption.
2025-02-22,"They priced it at a point where nobody in their right mind or with economic sense would touch it. 

No audience = no apps = dead product"
2025-02-22,"The average person has no use for a $3500 augmented reality headset that does not play video games.

If AVP had also launched with a bevy of AR or VR games that people wanted to play *and* were platform exclusive, I think the device might have been more successful in finding an audience. But without video games, AVP is kinda useless to most of us. And we’re not going to pay $3500 for what amounts to a toy.

Apple *needs* to start taking video games seriously. It’s the thing that’s actually holding them back in terms of Mac sales, and it’s what ultimately doomed Vision Pro."
2025-02-22,"Dang, I know the 'Redditors don't read articles' meme, but this comment section really shows that nobody here has watched or even intends to watch the video and are just discussing whatever they want."
2025-02-22,"I think another problem is the form factor for AR VR headsets in general.  They suck, you look like a dork, they are heavy and uncomfortable, and they are hard to use for people that wear glasses.  Nobody is going to put something in their face that doesn’t make them more attractive."
2025-02-22,I love mine and use it nearly everyday via the virtual display for my Mac. It’s become so embedded in my workflow I can’t imagine going back to not having it. I understand it’s not for everyone though given the price. I hope that Apple doesn’t give up on it and releases a cheaper model so it can go mainstream
2025-02-22,"Apple: Please make apps for our AR/VR device. 

Also Apple: No, not games. People don’t buy games. 

Also Apple: Only for our App Store. No sideloading. No apps where we can’t get a 30% cut. And that means no apps where is taking 30% would make it unprofitable for you. 

Final Apple: Why no one making software for our restricted device? Why no one buying it?"
2025-02-22,"It's not made for the masses, stop pretending like it was. It was for the SF tech elite and developers to actually have a platform to publish their apps on."
2025-02-22,"I saved my money to buy the AVP for when it releases here in Mexico, one year or more later there’s not a hint of when is it coming"
2025-02-23,Apple failed to embrace games properly… again…
2025-02-22,"Super ironic watching this from my Vision. I love mine, great for so many tasks and media. New major update today too. Do I recommend anyone need to buy this? Nawh. But it will mature and cheaper models will arrive. Until then I’ll keep enjoying it for what it’s worth."
2025-02-22,"I personally always thought it was going to be like this because it's just like the apple watch (albeit more expensive and complicated). Release the first gen, get early tech enthusiasts and some developers to get it, and then listen to their feed back about what it should, and shouldn't, focus on for the next generation. IMO with the apple watch it wasn't until the S4 that it REALLY was a good product."
2025-02-22,"It’s a product two years too early, two thousand too much, and too useless to own."
2025-02-22,It’s technology seeking a use case. Cool demo but doesn’t solve any problems.
2025-02-22,"Side note: This guy is suggesting Apple has sold 400,000 of these things. 

1. That seems like a lot. 
2. If true, that means 1.4 BILLION dollars worth of revenue for apple. Not sure what their R and D and costs have been but that is wild for a product everyone wants to say failed."
2025-02-22,I know it has flaws and there are cheaper options.  But I still really want a Vision Pro.  The price is the only thing keeping me from owning one.
2025-02-22,"I don’t think it was really intended to be a broad consumer product. It was a novelty, a luxury item, and a proof of concept of how Apple would operate in this AR/VR space."
2025-02-23,"It's too expensive and it's a first-gen product. It was only ever meant to appeal to early adopters with a lot of money.

Just like no one beyond diehards used macOS 10 until Jaguar or so. Cheetah and Puma were just too buggy and slow, but they were great previews of where the OS was going."
2025-02-24,"The Meta Quest headsets do *not* sell in volume and it's sold at the $300 to $500 price range.

There's no way a headset that's 10 times more expensive is going to sell in volume.

That's not even discussing the ergonomics (too heavy to wear for long periods of time) and aesthetics (looks dorky).

It's not, and will not be a product with mass appeal any time soon."
2025-02-22,"Besides price, the device is also horrible for families in that it cannot be shared by others in the household due to the specific way it fits each person. Unlike an iPad that anyone can pickup and use.

And the answer isn’t “just buy an AVP for everyone in your household.”

And there’s something standoffish about one person in a household being physically present but at the same time being deep in a virtual world that can’t be shared with others in the room with you."
2025-02-22,"I hate the hate this product gets. Do I have one? No. I have been in the VR space since DK1 though. Quest 3 and VR in general got a whole lot better because of the AVP. The problem with most headsets today is there are usually 1 or 2 positives with a lot more compromises. The AVP has almost no compromises except price. Their decision to use premium more heavy materials was not the best decision. I really wish they would consider nylon composites and gels but I doubt it. 

I’m pretty confident I will purchase the next generation AVP. I just hope they make the best headset possible and another headset for a more approachable entry price. Sadly then all we are going to get is complaints about the compromises on a cheaper model."
2025-02-22,Dude doesn’t know what the word “post mortem” means.
2025-02-22,God these thumbnails are nauseating.
2025-02-22,"Hardly dead yet though, is it?"
2025-02-22,"If it were priced like a Studio Display, it’d practically be a no-brainer. 
Honestly a headset that was just meant for connecting to your Mac/iPad/iPhone as a display extension would be amazing. It doesn’t need its own ecosystem, just make it an accessory."
2025-02-22,"So as we were saying since the reveal - too heavy to replace iPhone, too limited to replace computers, $3500 for a very unclear use case - just like iPad Pro. I wonder what lessons Apple takes from it and how AVP 2 would look like."
2025-02-22,"Amazing technology, but impractical and vastly overpriced."
2025-02-22,"The AVP has completely revolutionised the way I watch content / movies and do work on the Mac . 

Sure it’s expensive, but for what it does it’s worth it imo. 

It’s only going to get better. In a few iterations, people will really start to see the benefits"
2025-02-22,For me the limiting factor is that it's simply too heavy. I would probably use mine much more if they could offload some of the weight into the battery puck.
2025-02-22,Even at half price it’s way too much money
2025-02-22,It was too expensive for regular people to justify buying one. That’s where it went wrong
2025-02-22,Most people don't have 3K to spend on something they're not using heavily every day like they do a laptop or phone or car or bike etc.

2025-02-23,“Post-Mortem” Jesus Christ lmfao the copium is so real
2025-02-23,"Apple should have pivoted hard to Education and industry . My nursing school had something like 50 HoloLenses for “Simulation Lab”. They were a god-forsaken dumpster fire for the same price as AVP.

Take off the silly avatar eyes in front; sell for $2500 a piece and rake in the money. I think the HoloLenses were something like $4K?"
2025-02-23,"If it cost 1000 usd, it would have dominated the marked"
2025-02-24,Please - No Youtube!
2025-02-24,Did he really title a video postmortem about a product that is alive and well? Jesus fucking Christ we’re not even shying away from Clickbait anymore.
2025-02-23,Apple was trying to recreate the ipad at 5x the price. This will never take off until it’s under 1k.
2025-02-22,One factor - COST
2025-02-22,"I have a meta quest 3 and I can use it on top of my glasses. Aint no way I am spending extra on top of $7000 NZ just for the lenses, the lenses are the pice of quest 3."
2025-02-22,If it was half the price people would say the price needed to be half. Extremely expensive for such a niche product if you’re attempting to make it go mainstream
2025-02-22,"The problem aside from the price point is that all you can do with it is watch movies. The second you move your head, which happens often when you’re not watching movies, all of it becomes a blurry mess. I couldn’t even use it for work. You also know something is wrong when Apple Fitness isn’t integrated into it."
2025-02-23,"The problem with Vision Pro is basically everything. It has impressive technologies, that's for sure. But it doesn't solve anything. It doesn't make anyone's job easier in its current state (except perhaps for engineers and doctors). And not everyone is willing to pay $3,500 for something to watch videos on.

Vision Pro needs more apps (not even Apple's productivity apps are available on visionOS), a lower price, and a lighter design if Apple wants it to become a device for the masses.

Sure, these things may improve in the future, but until they do, competitors will have plenty of time to come up with similar and cheaper solutions. What I'm afraid of is that Apple won't be able to sustain the hype around the Vision Pro for much longer. If that happens, developers will begin to forget about the platform, and the result won't be good."
2025-02-23,It s funny listening to the all the low income people tell other people that something cost too much.
2025-02-22,They made something nobody wanted. End of explanation.
2025-02-22,"It was honestly a great headset, it just needed to be less than £3,400 🤷🏻‍♂️ with a few generations it’ll probably be a mainstay in households (who have money)"
2025-02-22,"Just like Apple Watch, usually second and third  generations could bring some improvements and hopefully price reduction."
2025-02-22,"They should have made it easier for users to at least do the things that can already be done on Meta Quest. It should have been positioned as better than what’s possible today, and more. 

By positioning it as completely different, it’s clear they didn’t have the ecosystem of content to make that other set of use cases real. 

I still like the device a lot and have hope that it will be more useful but they didn’t execute that part correctly."
2025-02-22,"When you have meta quest 3, its no brainer"
2025-02-22,Agree that the lack of content is the issue here. And please don't tell me that a 6 minute video about weirdos who surf in northern Norway in winter is good content.
2025-02-22,"It was, and is, a dev kit albeit a VERY nicely finished one. Too bad the consumer market is not ready for AR just yet."
2025-02-22,but why everyone says its done? I use it and there are new apps show up frequently. whats the issue? low sales?  or they stopped manufacturing completely?
2025-02-22,"the apple virtual boy incident, huh"
2025-02-22,Garbage content. Of course by a MAGA Utahn.
2025-02-22,"It's simple, it's insanely expensive and doesn't do anything people want. VR right off the bat is a niche thing, but then you go and make something that not only doesn't have a fraction of the support that a quest has, but the most fundamental apps like youtube etc. were missing. Maybe you want it for virtual desktops? Great, only works on macs. They got too cocky that people would eat up anything they throw out there and could never fail because they are Apple."
2025-02-22,"Funny, I was just thinking today ""I wonder what happened to the vision pro"", not heard about it for ages."
2025-02-22,$4K for a cool gadget that you can’t even easily share with family or friends.
2025-02-22,"When he was talking about it's weight and how it's uncomfortable,  I was thinking.. since it absolutely needs to have the battery plugged in, why couldn't they just put all the processing hardware + battery in an enclosure. The headset would thus become lighter and also allowed for easier iterative upgrades. You'd just use the headset as the monitor for the unit."
2025-02-22,It’s seems people’s vanity has some financial limits.
2025-02-23,"Cool, but not for the people. It's the Apple Glass people wanted."
2025-02-23,"Price, weight and utility x3.

  
The iPhone didn't have content either, but we understood how much of a game-changer it was."
2025-02-23,It was $3500
2025-02-23,I think the biggest problem is that they're trying to find a solution to a problem that doesn't really exist. Vr in general is one of those future things that we thought everyone would have but there's not a lot of practical uses for. Like a flying car or a robot butler.
2025-02-23,My wife & I use our Vision Pros everyday. Watching movies abd immersive content is amazing.
2025-02-23,Really really hoping for some VisionOS updates during this years WWDC.
2025-02-23,The price killed it if it was cheaper during the peak of its hype it would have been a hit
2025-02-23,"Apart from the cool factor, it's a portable screen that you can not share with anyone else.    
With that much money you can buy 7 Quest 3 and have a LAN party.    
I'm just saying, Q3 isn't a better product, but it makes more sense the thing you can do with a VR/AR headset currently"
2025-02-23,Guess we all came here to shit on Vision Pro? /s
2025-02-23,"VR/AR is just not 3,5k useful. Normal people wouldn’t spend more than $1000 on it, because it’s a novelty. Also, people telling me that „watching content” is a „killer feature” are deranged. Seriously? Watching a one-person-TV is worth 3,5k, when you can buy an OLED for that much? Wow, a nieche gadget TV, how interesting. Also „the first Mac was that price” the first Mac was a PC that had actual uses. On it, you could do things you couldn’t do anywhere else. Not the case here."
2025-02-23,Too expensive at a time of rising inflation
2025-02-23,Everyone knows. It just costs way too much. Developers aren’t going to make apps for it with the extremely small user base it has. Shame because it’s probably the most capable headset out there.
2025-02-23,It lacks controllers and a reasonable battery life. It will never be successful until both of these issues are fixed. Even then you are going to need a budget model for mass adoption.
2025-02-23,It’s both ahead of its time and far behind it. The hype around vr died years before it launched.
2025-02-24,Apple got into the business of something they shouldn't have. They should still stay out of it. Same about the car business.
2025-02-24,"I think you’re all over thinking it. 

No one at Apple thinks this combination of hardware and software is ready for prime time. 

But they think they know where this stuff will end up so they’re getting started on the software now. 

It’s a developer kit/ simulation of the experience they want to have ready one day in the future. 

They priced it accordingly and included a movie viewing mode and Mac display extension that lets early adopters feel like they didn’t completely waste their money."
2025-02-24,"Nothing happened. Nothing went wrong. 

Vision Pro had to be released at some point. 

Now Apple can iterate on visionOS, in public while they work towards the hardware they actually want to make that’s currently not possible

Developers can slowly get onboard and build apps

Apple can collect real world data and see what kind of spatial computing applications take off in the real world. 

Eventually they’re gonna have a way more appealing hardware product at a way more realistic price. 

And at that point visionOS will be several generations further along and hopefully the whole package will be substantially more useful and nice to use than it is now"
2025-02-24,"Too expensive and no real killer app. Same as with all vr! I know it’s not 1:1, but I bought the oculus 2, then gifted it to my mom, then bought the psvr2, then that is on its box and barely used. These devices simply have nothing interesting beyond the 1 week starting appeal, it’s sad. I think AR will be the real winner, hopefully apple catches up to meta"
2025-02-24,Had they made a $950 headset with that incredible screen I would have gotten one. Been using VR headsets for years for my animation projects and I own each Oculus version. The $3500 price tag murdered this product in the crib.
2025-02-24,"It’s awesome, but you need to launch a hardware product with compelling software.

Wearing a headset is also incredibly isolating. I hate the experience."
2025-02-26,I was too expensive.
2025-02-22,"This is the same dude that declared “Apple silicon magic is over.” Like really?

Please f***k off lmfao"
2025-02-22,"lmao this is the best passthrough of any headset, this guy is a fucking croc of shit"
2025-02-22,"I feel like I’m taking crazy pills. I used one… and the field of view, aka looking through goggles, really took me out of it. Plus it was heavy and not super comfortable. VR is still not ready for prime time. This wont be mainstream until something like the meta ray bans can also do AR as well as Vision Pro did"
2025-02-22,"The Vision is far from dead.    The coming Vision OS based on the 18.4 update adds  Intelligence.  Heck, for that matter,  Intelligence is far from finished; it’s still in beta. It too is considered a slow burn.

They also have a number of hardware updates in the works. This includes a cheaper, more consumer-based Vision currently in development.  Again, like most things Apple works on, it’s a slow burn to adoption.  

The Apple TV and iPad are good examples that took years before they actually caught on."
2025-02-22,"Ironically…. Apple “only” sold 500,000 but given it’s 10x the price more than the Quest 3, the Quest would need to sell 5 million to make the same money and about 1 - 2 mil have been sold."
2025-02-22,It’s a tech demo that doesn’t solve any problems. It’s what you get when engineers get excited about an idea but they don’t understand their users.
2025-02-22,"The two best experiences in VR to date are gaming and porn. This headset excels at neither category, is extremely expensive relative to the competition, is too heavy, and has no controllers."
2025-02-22,"We live in an era where some 10s of millions of people around the world can spend $4000 on their puppy.  $4000 on their GPU.  $4000 on a week's vacation, $4000 on a concert weekend.  What went wrong is they didn't give a shit about the AVP and its merry iPhone apps.  What was supposed to happen was they could not meet this demand."
2025-02-22,"I did the demo last fall at an Apple Store and found it to be incredibly overpriced for what it is. The quality of the display wasn’t great and the immersive mode was just “meh.” I can’t believe they’ve sold as many as this video says they have. I have never seen someone have a single one on and I live in a major northeast city where Apple products are everywhere. This is definitely their biggest failure. 

He’s also totally right about something else too — it’s so uncomfortable to wear."
2025-02-22,"IMHO it's an ""early developer release"" being marketed as a consumer product. Interesting to play with, but until the size/weight issues are resolved and there is more content available, it's not going to sell to consumers in any significant numbers. OTOH, if you are a developer and want to start working with the tech so you can be ready when a more consumer-friendly version is available in a couple/few years, it's pretty awesome.

It also serves to show where Apple is at with the tech, which is pretty far IMHO, if you compare the fit-and-polish of the experience against competitors."
2025-02-22,"$3,500 lol"
2025-02-23,too expensive and it doesn’t do much. ppl can barely afford an iphone without having to do a payment plan. Apple went full greed on this product. but most likely it’ll be good around 2030. 2031 at the latest
2025-02-23,"False! The Apple Vision Pro provides early adopters the chance to preview a game changing product. The era of spatial computing is here as tomorrow’s product, today!!!"
2025-02-22,"Oh noes. They only sold (checks notes) about as many as they predicted they'd be able to make, actually about 50% more."
2025-02-22,"First, Snazzy Labs is one of the biggest purveyors of click bait garbage around.

Second, Apple sold almost as many of the Vision Pros as they could make. You know they made a profit on them. More importantly they gathered a metric shit ton of telemetry to go along with all the development data they have from producing them.

I don’t know for sure, but I’m going to guess Apple does not consider them a failure."
2025-02-23,It was never meant to be a mass product. It was meant for developers to start producing apps for the next platform
2025-02-22,Apple did a good job on this release. It was never meant for the consumers. This is a development device.
2025-02-22,No one wants VR
2025-02-22,This is easy…… it costs too much!!!!!!
2025-02-22,Make it $699 and see it sell like hotcakes. Take a hit initially but win in the end
2025-02-22,"Same thing that happened to the Holo-lens... It was big and bulky and expensive and didn't have a ton of use beyond the ""wow factor""."
2025-02-22,Only if it is sold at $500.
2025-02-22,OP needs mental help.
2025-02-22,I did the demo at the Apple store a while back and was simply blown away. Nothing prepared me for how cool it was. But it’s still not $4k cool.
2025-02-22,"It also doesn’t help that it’s a first gen product. Even as someone who wastes way too much money on dumb niche tech, I almost always wait for a gen 2 version that irons out the annoyances no one thought of until the product was actually in people’s hands."
2025-02-22,"This is the best way to put it. I did the Demo and raved about it to everyone who would listen, but followed up with “if it was half its price I would maybe consider it”."
2025-02-22,"It's not _just_ the price.

They made it heavy because it has to feel _premium_ instead of prioritizing comfort and lightness (same issue with the AirPods Max), they added features that add costs and weight and make the battery life worse (the creepy EyeSight) that for a significant portion of people do not matter at all. Also the FOV is not great either.

And it doesn't suit the two bigger VR drivers right now: games and porn. While it's not great at ""productivity"" either.

Great device, but has a ways to go.

If it had the same price, but was super comfortable and light, with a longer battery life, and had proper gaming and productivity functions, it would have done better than it did."
2025-02-22,"I think Apple in their hubris overestimated the appeal at launch (at $4k) and expected scale to kick in to save future versions. I think that coupled with a lack of basic apps like YouTube and Netflix, and a real ‘have to have it’ application / use case have killed this product. 

Could you imagine if Apple sold this for $2k taking a hit on the hardware, and bundling some kind of service with it? Would have sold like crazy."
2025-02-22,Meta quest is much better for what it is/more affordable.
2025-02-22,That’s the fate of VR
2025-02-22,I wish the pass through was better. I tried to cook with one on and it was just too difficult to see. I couldn’t read anything that wasn’t projected by the Vision Pro.
2025-02-22,"Apple had to have known, I’m guessing it brackets the price so we’re all gonna jump on the $2499 model."
2025-02-22,"Crazy part was that it was worry the price they just didn’t give it time. 

Like I wanted it for operating camera on commercials. All of our gear is super expensive the price of it would be trivial."
2025-02-22,Specially when you can buy a quest for 300 and do even more compatibility wise
2025-02-23,"It’s cool. I want one. But not THIS one.

This one is both too expensive and TOO UNCOMFORTABLE TO WEAR!

Once they make a lighter version that won’t feel like I’m wearing a torture device or sitting in an eye exam… THEN I’d consider buying one for whatever ungodly amount of money they want for it.

But hopefully they also get that ungodly amount down to… not quite so ungodly.

Also… WIDER FIELD OF VIEW PLEASE. I was surprised how narrow the field of view was when I tested one out. It’s like wearing binoculars, when it should feel like wearing glasses."
2025-02-23,"It’s a new product from a company that makes stuff more expensive than others. The price point is understandable for a first iteration of tech from Apple who wants more money. 

Wait a couple decades and the same version in the future will be cheaper. But also very different. 

It’s all more than bad for consumers."
2025-02-22,"no it really wasnt at all , it was the best vr display ever evrything else is shit including design but sound is awesome actually"
2025-02-23,"Not a consumer gadget. A developer gadget.

Why do so many people get so offended by products in their 1.0 iteration?

I WANT this, but I can’t afford this? Does that make it bad? It apparently requires endless accounts of why random dude x, y, or z loves this thing but can’t justify spending money on it. OK, so don’t.

I DON’T WANT this because obscure features Q and P aren’t available? Yes, I know, no product should ship until it has every feature that 20 different tech reviewers think is ‘crucial’.

Very few people care what YOUR use case for it is, and why you’re so outraged over the cost of a product that required a shit-ton of R&D just to get it to 1.0."
2025-02-22,I think we have too many distractions in this day and age.  Many computers and gadgets were far more expensive than $3500 in the 80s and 90s in real terms.  The C64 was $1900 USD in current dollars when it was first released!
2025-02-23,Probably why Apple was aiming it for earlier adopters and tech enthusiast. There obviously isn’t a mass market device and Apple knows that.
2025-02-22,Especially if you’d need to change it every 2 years when it slows down because of software updates
2025-02-24,The original Macintosh was over $7000 accounting for inflation.
2025-02-22,"The price was a problem, but it wasn’t the *biggest* problem.

People would have paid that price *if it did something they needed*. But it doesn’t. Outside of a handful of industrial uses, augmented reality has consistently bombed when put into consumer hands. We don’t know what it’s for. We don’t have a great use for it. It isn’t even entertaining most of the time.

If you’re going to introduce a $3500 device, it needs to have a use case that will spur mass adoption. It needs a killer app. And AVP did not have a killer application."
2025-02-22,During a looming recession and on the heels of a world wide pandemic. Smrt.
2025-02-23,"People do not understand Silicon Valley. Amazon wasn’t seeing success until the 2008 recession and they were burning through money. Now they own the market nad have basically choked everyone out due to warehousing reach. Nobody can deliver faster worldwide.

I look at the Touchbar, Vision Pro, AppleTV, Smart Home as a play for the living room that will be between Apple, Microsoft and Meta. Microsoft isn’t trying to sell consoles anymore and gaming is likely to evolve soon.

Having fabricated hardware myself, I see the Vision Pro V1 as a test of viability and a way to press the market forward. We are already seeing lighter solutions and Meta is attacking it from a different angle in which theg will likely merge Raybans and their VR headset at a later date when they look more like glasses.

Don’t forget  FAANG have money to burn as this is mainly a 20 year R&D phase."
2025-02-22,"It was the definition of a first generation product. Too expensive, not enough functionality, niche market."
2025-02-22,"Everybody who Apple wanted to buy this thing, bought it. It was never meant to be a mass consumer product. That is like extremely obvious. It’s a glimpse at tomorrow’s technology, today."
2025-02-22,"Yep, I would have loved to buy it, I have disposable income and frequently buy tech early. However at $5,000 Canadian for this, I just couldn’t do it."
2025-02-22,"Even Jobs was smart enough to subsidize the iPhone until it hit critical mass. If they had subsidized it at a price to get market penetration and DEV adoption it could have been killer. 

But as a headset the PSVR2 is awesome for gaming, why would I drop 3k on the headset when 1k has done the job for what I want."
2025-02-22,It works for Marco.
2025-02-22,As someone who really enjoys playing VR games the lack of games is really disappointing. They really should have stuff like superhot and beat saber a part of apple arcade for the vision pro
2025-02-22,This is the exact reason why I can’t really justify a MacBook at the moment. Apple needs some kind of answer to proton on Lennox or I just don’t think they’re ever going to be gaming machines. I mean they’re literally the richest tech company on the planet is there some reason they can invest more funds into gaming?
2025-02-23,"> The average person has no use for a $3500 augmented reality headset that does not play video games.

The average doesn't even have a use for a $500 mixed reality headset that DOES play games.

That's the problem.  The entire VR market is, has been for decades, and will be for the foreseeable future, one primarily aimed at tech enthusiasts, gamers and other hobbyists, and niche professional use cases.  

No one outside that slice of the market wants to strap screens on their heads for hours at a time, when they have a phone/tablet/laptop instead.  Period.  *Maybe* AR glasses will take off, but honestly...I'm not even sure of that, considering how many people *literally need glasses to see properly* and still either try to avoid wearing them as much as possible or prefer sticking lenses in their eyes over it.

That's how deeply ingrained it is for people to *fucking hate having to wear something on their face.*"
2025-02-22,Would gamers be open to apple if it means never updating your graphics card? It makes a Mac more like a console than a computer.
2025-02-23,"I think you overestimate driver of game sales:  the Quest sales have been collapsing every year since the pandemic.  

that said they're dozens of games for the Vision Pro plus pretty much every PC or console game can be streamed with upscale 4K, PCVR games can be streamed with surreal touch controller and eventually with Sony controllers, and there are lots of native games with hand tracking.  One of the best use cases is streaming from a Windows box."
2025-02-23,"That’s what’s the point of the AVP was, isn’t it?

Get developers working on apps, but maybe they should have subsidised the costs."
2025-02-23,"It's odd that it hasn't happened naturally without Apple pushing it. M Series Macs are everywhere, and they're nowhere near as diverse in spec as PC processors so in theory shouldn't it be easy to justify the work relative to the large install base and potential customers?- it feels almost console like in how similar M Series chips are, and yet developers don't seem to target the platform, despite it looking like low hanging fruit, from where I'm standing at least."
2025-02-22,I've been saying this for years and they already have the perfect device for games. The AppleTV box with an M processor in it could handle AAA games. Price it just below the cost of a Nintendo switch and it will sell.
2025-02-22,That’s the Reddit experience.
2025-02-23,"> you look like a dork

People said the same about airpods and the apple watch. This is something that gets less and less of an issue the more people have it (granted a headset has a higher barrier here)

> they are heavy and uncomfortable

This is something a good strap can solve. While I would prefer something smaller I can wear my quest3 for two hours without issues, which is (at least for me) the maximum amount of time I would want to be in VR.

>  they are hard to use for people that wear glasses

This is easily addressed by using lens inlays, but of course this raises the price of the device even more."
2025-02-23,"I've seen others say that Mac screen mirroring is their primary use, but it does make my wonder why Apple didn't let vision pros run Mac apps, they're literally using the same processors."
2025-02-23,"Agreed. I wasn’t a huge Mac fan before I saw the announcement last year.  I saved up and ended up not only buying the AVP, but also diving into the entire Apple ecosystem…iPad, MacBook etc.  it’s all been gaming changing for my life, both work and play."
2025-02-23,"Same. I use it for work more so than play, but I use it everyday."
2025-02-22,"The thing that people don’t mention is that the APIs are shit. You’re boxed into SwiftUI, which is limited and buggy. And there’s so much basic stuff you can’t do/don’t have access to."
2025-02-23,Not even Apple has made the effort to bring its own productivity apps to Vision Pro lol
2025-02-23,Apple has not asked that though

I can definitely see this thing catching on more broadly in several years when the form factor becomes less cumbersome. But in my field I am so happy this thing exists.

EDIT: For anyone actually curious in how egocentric data is being used in the field of AI and robotics, [this](https://egomimic.github.io) is a recent paper from a Georgia Tech student with some cool results."
2025-02-22,I disagree. The devs should have been given a dev kit a year in advance because the biggest issue with it is lack of dev support.
2025-02-22,"Okay but they didn't, the thing doesn't have many apps"
2025-02-22,"That’s what I’m saying. It’s a first gen product, it’s going to be rough, it’s going to have issues, but it’s only going to get better as they iterate. Maybe I’m overly optimistic, but I don’t think Apple is going to just drop this product category after one product that doesn’t sell well. They have so much in time and R&D, and this area will only grow."
2025-02-22,So then why is it dead?
2025-02-22,"Thank you lol. Med device companies have been doing really cool stuff with these. Recently a surgeon in Brazil recorded a case with his case info/navigation in his Vision Pro HUD.

It’s just like Hololens, a product given some piecemeal consumer marketing whose real purpose was to be a tool sold to the Dept. of Defense."
2025-02-24,"Yes, because focusing on gaming sure worked well for Meta and their $60 billion loss

Apple does what they’re doing. They’re out multi trillion dollar company. Everybody here acting like they did absolutely zero market research and are shocked at the sales numbers are incredibly naïve. Focusing on gaming would relate this to a game console and that’s something that people don’t want. They want a device that will do it all at some point. A general purpose device like an iPad or a Mac.

Really annoying when people expect a generation one device to be a generation six device"
2025-02-22,I had a Quest and switched to the AVP. My problem is that there isn’t much the AVP can do that the Quest can’t at a much lower price point and with more game dev support.
2025-02-22,Do you use it for much besides watching media? Like do you use it for work?
2025-02-22,"Yeah I think they'll soon realize this is for media consumption and gaming, some people use it as a Mac display for work but it seems like the main thing people get out of it is movies."
2025-02-22,"It is wild to me how anyone can be so unimaginative. Think of all the many use cases we have for desktops, laptops, smartphones and tablets etc.
Can you really not think of _anything_ where an immersive spatial interface has _any_ use case at all?"
2025-02-24,Steve? Steve Ballmer? Is that really you?
2025-02-22,"Somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 is accurate.  All the doom and gloom is mostly click bait.  I’d expect they would break even on it this year, but it’ll take another generation or two to recoup historical R&D costs."

2025-02-26,"> revenue

Does your comment not realize that revenue is not profit?

> R and D

Does your comment not know that there’s also marketing costs, manufacturing costs, distribution costs, training costs?

And is your comment confused about the scale threshold of “success” for an enormous global corporation compared to?

> everyone wants to say failed

The best evidence is that after all the ridiculous levels of daily hype *before* it released, we heard *nothing but crickets* after it releases.  No one cared about it, not even the tech-fetish cheerleaders.  It’s a failed product.

We see many rationalizations about it in these discussions. Statistically your reply to me is going to say: “it wasn’t meant to be sold, it was just meant to create a development and market environment for the NEXT versions!”  But…that isn’t how product releases and marketing work, and certainly isn’t how developer ecosystems work."
2025-02-22,Maybe sell some blood
2025-02-22,I’m sure they learned a lot about the technology and a lot of it will get reused in other products. Maybe another headset but also phones and computers.
2025-02-23,"And immersive VR headset, too.    Meta is trying hard to turn Horizon OS into a spatial Android tablet (and social media hub)  before Android XR ships."
2025-02-22,"I think in general it's just very cumbersome to use, like even if it's better than an iPad or Mac it has to be substantially better to justify strapping it to your face"

Yes. But the exact same is true for an iPhone. That is why as price comes down, everyone will have one."

2025-02-22,If it was $500 I’d get one.  That’s what it’s worth to me.  It has no valid use case for my life outside of “cool toy” or “fun way to watch movies” and $500 is the absolute max I’d pay for that.  Is the device worth more (costs more) than that?  Obviously.  But just because the value of its components is higher doesn’t mean its utility to me personally is worth that much.

If the category flourishes, sports will be nuts on it."
2025-02-23,The odd thing is all this can be applied to the 1995 Virtual Boy. So the lessons learned from 30 years ago were forgotten.
2025-02-23,"It sounds like the above is accurate in all the essential combinations, especially Apple’s tendency towards over-pricing in design by design:

\>\*”They made it heavy because it has to feel *premium* instead of prioritizing comfort and lightness (same issue with the AirPods Max), they added features that add costs and weight and make the battery life worse (the creepy EyeSight) that for a significant portion of people do not matter at all. Also the FOV is not great either.”\*"
2025-02-23,"High end VR headsets are often heavier than Vision Pro, and don't really feel all that premium.  

I'm not sure why you think it doesn't suit porn.  Media consumption is what it's great at.  As for productivity, I use it 7 hours a day, so it's ... pretty good at that too.  

Gaming it's suited just fine for if you have a hand tracked game or can bring controllers."
2025-02-22,im not even sure $2k would have sold that well. it’s a halo product that is good in short bursts due to form factor. the utility isn’t that much more than a much cheaper VR headset like the quest 3 right now and it doesn’t have many games. the real game changer will be AR glasses that can be worn all day.
2025-02-22,"I have one, and I enjoy it, but the lack of native apps really restricts how frequently I use it.  Netflix, YouTube and Facebook would’ve been great."
2025-02-22,"It’s different use cases. I have both, the Quest is head and shoulders better in terms of gaming. The VP is better at movies and productivity."
2025-02-22,"I hate how dominant Meta is in this space. The Metaverse (despite its laughable launch) has potential and Meta pushes a lot of content. I simply hate their business model with all the data collection, advertising and the customer as the product."
2025-02-22,"No it’s not. Not even close. I own a quest 3. It’s much more affordable yes, but the experience is far worse than Vision Pro."
2025-02-22,I have more than enough money to buy it. Its just not worth €4000
2025-02-22,"Or maybe, too many people know how to prioritize things in life"
2025-02-22,"I genuinely think the only thing I “own” that costs as much or more than the Vision Pro is my car. And I had to finance that. Even my MacBook Pro was half of that, and I only spent as much as I did because I wanted a better computer for work. Literally nothing else in my house even comes close."
2025-02-23,"> Outside of a handful of industrial uses, augmented reality has consistently bombed when put into consumer hands. We don’t know what it’s for. We don’t have a great use for it. It isn’t even entertaining most of the time.

Yep, there just isn't anything super compelling that they bring to the table once you get past the initial ""wow"" factor.  

Worse, *it is consistently more annoying to use than other pieces of technology.*

VR headsets may take time for some people to acclimate to in terms of motion sickness, force you to stare at screens at all times, have garbage battery life, block your awareness of the outside world and make you feel isolated unless pass through is on(and still make you seem checked out to others regardless), make you look dorky, mess with your hair and makeup, and are just generally less significantly comfortable for long periods of use(yes, even 'lightweight' ones. People just plain hate putting things on their face...ask the folks who refuse to wear glasses and resort to sticking things in their eyes to see).

There isn't a single activity for the average consumer which isn't actively compromised or unnecessarily complicated by them.

AR Glasses *may* end up being the way this technology finally breaks through, but honestly while I was bullish on them a year ago....as more of the early versions of this tech hit the market(and completely fail to capture an audience outside tech nerds) I increasingly suspect even that could be a hard sell."
2025-02-22,"> We don’t know what it’s for

Other than the industry specific stuff you mention - gaming. Not all games are good on it, but there’s a core niche of games that do really well on it. Apple hates games tho."
2025-02-23,"Chicken and Egg problem. Devs need a device too, you know, develop on.

Version 1 allows them to start playing and any early adopter bleeding edgers can play too.

Apple products aren’t ready for the masses until V3, same as it has always been."
2025-02-23,"Exactly. Every single important product in the history of tech had a killer app.

Apple II had VisiCalc. The PC had Lotus 1-2-3. The Macintosh had the GUI (first) and desktop publishing (later on). Windows later got the Office suite. Until the Vision Pro has a killer app that is so good it's worth buying the entire system, it isn't going to take off."
2025-02-23,"Actually it does have some great industrial uses. It’s used for example in my field (aircraft maintenance) for training. But you don’t need a 4000 usd device to do that.

Apple vision has the potential to gain market share in commercial application. But the price needs to come down a lot."
2025-02-23,"Nope again - 4 grand for a headset is a lot of money, it failed because of price, are you aware of the world we’re living in currently? Times are tough, nobody, most likely including you, has 4 grand for an AVP right now"
2025-02-22,If they had released it in 2019 or early 2020 I bet it would’ve really gained traction since people had nothing else to do.

iPhone was UNsubsidized, fully. It was relentlessly mocked for its price

Apple chose to sell this product at cost, and unlike iPhone where the smartphone market was already established and manufacturing could produce millions of units, the spatial computer market is nascent and manufacturing is hard capped at 0.5 million units per year (1 million microOLED panels)"
2025-02-22,"You may want to read up on some history here. iPhone launched at full MSRP, on a 2yr contract, with no subsidies.

It wasn’t until after iPhone 3G was announced that the carrier stepped In to subsidize it (AT&T had to push for that, because they wanted the increased customer base and increase to ARU)"
2025-02-22,The carriers subsidized it.
2025-02-22,Could get an Oculus and a PSVR for 1100
2025-02-22,"Proton also exists for Mac. It’s how so many games on Steam actually *do* work on Macs, especially older games that can be easily translated to Apple’s GPU API and especially on old Intel Macs.

The issue is that over on Linux, you’re using the same graphics cards that you do on Windows. As a result, a lot of the code that actually generates the UI for video games does not need to change when you change operating systems. But on a Mac, graphics are a different story, as Apple doesn’t actually support industry standard graphics APIs on macOS anymore.  (Linux *does* provide such support for M1 GPUs, so it’s not that it isn’t possible, it’s just that Apple is being deliberately difficult—later Apple Silicon processors are still under active development, and their drivers have not landed in the mainstream Linux kernel yet.) 

That all said, there are only three categories of people for whom the lack of games should be a reason to pass on a MacBook Air (because of the inherent compromises in gaming laptops):

1. College students
2. Frequent travelers
3. Budget-sensitive gamers who can only afford one computer

The reason I say this is because if you have a desktop rig, there *are* workarounds, especially for single-player games.  You *can* connect to your desktop rig from your Mac. If you’re on the same network, you’ll likely be fine to remote into your desktop rig and play that way.  But this will not work as a travel solution, as lag will get to be a real pain quickly if you are not on the same local network. And you will *always* have a better PC gaming experience in front of an actual desktop gaming rig."
2025-02-23,"They do invest into gaming, the game porting toolkit exists for that reason. Now the reason gaming is so poor on Macs is they don't want people to play games unless THEY make money from it. The toolkit exists to demonstrate and convince devs to bring their games to Apple arcade or the app store.

Being able to support steam games would be a nightmare for them because they make no money from that."
2025-02-23,"There are quite a few top games on the Mac lately: Resident evil 7 and 8,  Balders gate  3, death stranding , etc.  there's also proton/crossover that lets you play diablo 4, helldivers 2, etc"
2025-02-23,"They don’t want it to be a gaming machine, and Macs are useful enough to have a large market regardless. Not very similar cases"
2025-02-22,"Apple GPUs are good enough. Not for the hardcore PC gamer, but the vast majority aren't like that.

I know it's not the same, but look at Nintendo. They released a massively underpowered console, and it's close to becoming the most sold console ever.

But they have the games to go with it.

It's incredible Apple can't or doesn't care to push gaming on their devices. Because the power is there.

If Apple was _serious_ about gaming, it would be a great platform for gaming. An Apple TV with an M chip + controller (with a ton of investment on games) could take over a sizeable non hardcore gaming population. But they are content with the shitty mobile games with in app purchases."
2025-02-22,"I don’t think that’s going to matter so much.

The average gamer doesn’t stand in line to grab the latest and greatest high end video card every release.  Indeed, they tend to upgrade their GPUs like they update their phones: every few years when it becomes necessary.  My gamer coworkers are mostly still running RTX 3070’s without plans to upgrade in the next 18 months.  Indeed, for the average gamer, their gaming rig *is* their daily driver at home, and they do other work on it besides playing video games.  Upgrading a graphics card is quite disruptive for them, as it means actually having to turn off and unplug their computers.

That said, the hardcore gamer (the one who actually *does* graphics card upgrades on a regular basis) is never going to be a Mac user. And that’s fine—they want more control over their computers than they’d get buying from Lenovo or Dell, and Apple gives them radically *less* control than that. But the hardcore gamer is not the average gamer. They’re at the tail end of the bell curve. But just because a person isn’t willing or able to have a dedicated gaming-only computer that they upgrade frequently doesn’t mean that they don’t play video games and expect to be able to play their favorites on any computer they’d buy."
2025-02-22,Plenty of people game on Windows laptops that can't upgrade the GPU either.
2025-02-22,There’s a lot of console gamers

The future of computers is plainly not a device you strap to your face that only gets a few hours of battery life at a time by way of a huge battery that you put in your pocket with a cable that runs up to the side of your head

VisionOS may well be apples future, Vision Pro plainly isn’t."
2025-02-22,"why are you speaking in past tense?  the new blackmagic camera for this thing isn’t even out yet.  apple isn’t going to abandon this multi-billion dollar platform 1 year after the (obvious) dev platform ships, and while the next version is in development."
2025-02-22,">Maybe I’m overly optimistic, **but I don’t think Apple is going to just drop this product category** after one product that doesn’t sell well. They have so much in time and R&D, and this area will only grow.

that is the big question.  Is the AVP the *Apple Newton* (same idea as iPhone but far too early -- tech wasn't good enough) or is it the a *Apple Watch* at a *beta/devkit/tech-demo* price point but with a clear technology roadmap to an affordable product?

Rumors suggest they are working on a less expensive version.   IMO, making AVP ""the external monitor your laptop/desktop can have"" (at the right price point) would be a killer app.  Part of that is having it be comfortable during long usage.  Another part is allowing effectively infinite displays.

I think it is an open question whether it is still too early for AR/VR to take off in the next 10 years or not.  Back when the Oculus CV1 came out I thought we'd be a lot farther along by now."

2025-02-24,It’s funny because I remember people saying this about iPads when they first came out and Windows tablets. Acting like they have absolutely no idea what to do with it and don’t know why they should buy it. Not sure why people think that the Apple Vision Pro should be a game console. People don’t expect that out of a Mac or even a iPad.
2025-02-22,"Yep! Outside of media, I primarily use it for work. I have my email, messaging apps, documents and browsers open up in multiple spaces. Add music or a video somewhere and sometimes my Macs super ultrwide display, and I’m fully ready to go, at home, in a hotel, plane, or the temp offices I work out of. There is very little this thing cant do on its own. 

Typically I use a low latency, high polling rate mouse (magic mouse is trash, sadly) and a keyboard when I am ready to lock in but for casual typing like this comment I’ll just use my eyes and look at the letters I want to type. It’s shockingly fast, maybe 4-6 letters per second."

2025-02-22,"Yeah, with enough advancements in battery and processor tech, spatial interface will definitely reach mainstream. Maybe not in 5 years, but likely in 15. It’s an objectively better tech that utilizes a whole new dimension, leveraging more senses than just vision and hearing. If tiktok and short-form media with flashy flat-screen video and audio are highly addictive, imagine what a fully interactive 3d environment could do, where sounds come from any direction and you get tactile feedback from interactions. People will be absolutely hooked."

That argument is just: those things, but on your face.

It’s cumbersome and it’s not actually more effective or convenient than other devices/screens.

Meanwhile your comment says it’s “wild” to be so imaginative and you’re incredulous that someone can’t think of a good purpose…and your comment suggests **zero** cases.  And also meanwhile, all the made-up examples of real-time fancy AR can be done with a tablet."

Sitting and working productively in a Meta Quest 3 is not optimal (Immersed is the only real solution here, it’s 3rd party and is quirky).

I said I wasn’t gonna buy it for the longest time and then I finally did. Worth every cent. Excited to see where it’s gonna go from here."

2025-02-22,"I got nothing but anecdotes, but I don't know a single person who wants to spend thousands to wear this ridiculous thing just to be less useful than the $600 16e. 

Outside of the initial hype, I've never heard a single person even mention the vision pro in the wild. Nobody has ever said to me (a former Apple employee that still works in tech, mind you) that they're interested in buying one, asked me about it, even said the words. I get asked about the next iPhone every week, usually multiple times, the latest one could have dropped  4 hours prior."
2025-02-22,"Haven't watched the video yet, but I think the long answer you have in mind is kind of beating around the bush and it kind of does boil down to this. 

I got a Meta Quest 3 that I justified as a temporary disability aid because I couldn't sit comfortablely at a desk for about a year due to a health condition. I used it for remote desktop/productivity and loved it. I am not a VR hater. I also didn't get it for games, so the AVP has some real appeal to me if it had been an option when I needed it. Here's why I think this product didn't succeed. 

1. Price - way overshot premium products in the category, and the leading product is being subsidized so it looks even worse. I would totally take an AVP over an MQ3, but if it was just twice the price rather than 7x I'd still be looking over the pro cons list and debating whether it was worth just $500 more. At $3000 more it's a total nonstarter. Even many enthusiasts don't necessarily like feeling taken advantage of on price.

2. The tech just isn't good enough outside of games to justify the tradeoffs. As a disability aid, VR was magic. Now that I'm able to return to a desk, it's a far superior way to use a computer. Passthrough isn't nearly as convenient as just not having a helmet on and seeing with my own eyes. I don't expect helmet like VR headsets to take off outside of games until it's basically a pair of glasses. Big Screen and Immersed are doing the same kind of VR with that size of headset. XReal is doing a different kind of VR also at that size. I think if you could make a self contained headset that can last 3+ hours at that size, you might minimize the tradeoffs enough to be worth it. I believe every headset mentioned has little to no onboard compute so they aren't succeeding here either. 

3. AVP wasn't designed or marketed for gaming. This is the one area where VR is super different from the alternative way of doing things. Watching a movie or working on a spreadsheet can be more fun in VR but it's fundamentally the same experience as traditional screens. VR gaming feels radically different and really wasn't part of tbe pitch to buy an AVP.

So why would someone buy this? It's expensive and it's not doing anything most people want. Even if it was cheaper I don't think that fixes the issue of not having a clear purpose. It would sell better because more people would want to check it out since it's from Apple but I don't think the daily active users would be in the millions. The tech just isn't there yet for being something people are ready to fully adopt, and Apple made this product in particular badly - it's far heavier than it needs to be, seemingly has vastly more compute than you'd need for what it's capable of, doesn't come with controllers, and has a fully external battery that isn't hot swappable. They tried to do the impossible and didn't even give it their best try."

At this point I think I’ll just wait it out and see what the second generation has to offer.

At $4k developers aren't going to put a lot of resources into making content for a small, affluent enthusiast user base.

2025-02-23,"To me, the biggest hurdle is still ""why do I need this? What is the killer app?""

It's just that simple. Apple II had VisiCalc. It could do spreadsheets before anyone else. Then that died off when the PCs got Lotus 1-2-3. Once we moved beyond spreadsheets, it was all about the GUI. Thus the Macintosh. But then people found out beyond the UI it didn't do much, so the PC was better. But then the Macintosh got new life with desktop publishing. And so on.

Every single device I can think of has had some kind of killer app that justified the price. That created some new paradigm or standard. Vision Pro is cool, but even at a cheaper price (like the Meta Quest level of pricing), it still just feels like a toy I'd use a few times and forget about."
2025-02-23,It’s both.
2025-02-23,"It reminds me years ago I bought a “overpriced”Playstation4 literally on released date and there were almost no games published. I bought a game which I didn’t like just to play something. Several years later (prices dropped and games were released) I finally enjoyed playing.

Especially considering you can get can a fantastic VR experience (even better in many ways) for a small fraction of the price."
2025-02-23,The lack of content is because of the price. It didn't hit mass market appeal so nobody had any incentive to support it or make apps for it.
2025-02-24,"What you're both getting at is ""value""... ie, how much you get in exchange for how much you pay. If Vision Pro had more content than competition from HTC, Meta, etc then it might be better value even if it was more expensive than the others. The problem for Apple is that the competitors are cheaper and have more content, so Apple is just out to lunch because they have nothing captivating that people are willing to pay that kind of premium for (yet?)."
2025-02-22,There’s millions of movies to take advantage of those displays.
2025-02-22,"I think the issue is more about discoverability. To me, there’s more content available on the Vision Pro than I have time in the day.  Not all of it is immersive, of course,  but there’s just so much to do.  I started to post comments on the Vision Pro sub Reddit about this, but I may put together a user guide because I think that’s what sorely needed."

Have you used it for more than 5 minutes? Because the weight is absolutely a major downside.

Even if it costed 10 dollars, the weight would still be a massive issue.

2025-02-23,"> High end VR headsets are often heavier than Vision Pro,

Not sure which high end VR headsets you mean. But do they have all the weight on your face?

As for porn or games, having to use Safari to watch anything isn't the ideal universe we are talking about.

Even ignoring the kind of games you can have, thanks to Apple being extremely behind on gaming compared to even Linux today (which is ridiculous), with some alternatives like GeForceNow you are just limited to Safari (or third party hacky apps) because they don't let you have native apps.

For a company where everything ""just works"" there's so many hurdles you need to overcome.

If it works for you, that's amazing. To me (and clearly I'm not the only one, just look at the video on this thread and a lot of the comments) it's just easier _not_ to use it for most things than to use it. 

It's cool. But not worth it at this point, and that goes beyond the price."

2025-02-22,"I did a Vision demo and now own a Quest 3. I’d agree that the Vision is better… but not the almost 8+ times better you’d expect based on the price difference.

Both machines have the same fundamental flaws: they’re huge and clunky and heavy and the battery life is bad. That really limits the number of things I’m likely to use them for, and how long I’m likely to use them.

It might be worth paying that much extra for a machine that solves those problems, but the Vision isn’t that. So really there’s little motivating me to pay a small fortune for a marginally technically superior experience, that isn’t able to play Alyx or most other VR games."
2025-02-22,"Yeah, but a $500 quest 3 collecting dust 25 days a month is a lot easier to swallow than $4k."

It all had to do with the fact that there was no point to it. There are no games, and that’s the *only* thing that it could theoretically do better than my M2 iPad Pro. In fact, if I *were* to buy another iDevice right now (and to be clear, I’m not in the market for another iDevice), it’d be an M4 Mac Mini, not Vision Pro."
2025-02-26,"In summary: it was always a corporate “me too” and marketer’s product, not a customer’s product.  (And “price” is a convenient excuse for the tech-fetishist cheerleaders, when the reality is the product was useless and annoying.)

Part of me thinks the Vision Pro might have been tempting of it was a spatial MacBook, since then it would be the only device you’d need to bring with you.

2025-02-22,"If you mainly use your iPad then I don’t see why you’d need a Mac for Virtual Display. 

Vision Pro supports iPad apps so technically you can multi task with iPad apps + native apps.

With that said, I agree. Apart from the occasional 5 minute Apple immersive video that gets released once in a blue moon, I only use it for Virtual Display. Though for me as a software developer who relies on 3 monitors, PERSONALLY, that’s worth the price. It means I’m not tethered to my home office and I can somewhat comfortably work from anywhere. 

I just wish there was more 3D / immersive content or at least some serious immersive games (like Zelda but immersive and 3D) which I could play when I’m not working. It doesn’t need to have PS5 graphics, Switch graphics is fine as long as the game has depth and a good storyline. Regular controller is also fine, I’m not even asking for the PSVR split controllers."
2025-02-22,I don’t think they intended for this first model to be for the average consumer. I’d look at this as a beta/dev kit to get the app development and bugs worked out before hitting the big stage with a lower priced consumer model.
2025-02-22,"They clearly weren’t trying to make a product for the average consumer on the first iteration. It’s called the Vision Pro after all.

Every other product category they sell has an average consumer model. 

iPhone Pro / iPhone 
iPad Pro / iPad 
AirPods Pro / AirPods
MacBook Pro / MacBook Air
Watch Ultra / Watch
Etc

A cheaper model will be introduced at some point and it’ll probably be named Apple Vision. 

It’s not uncommon for companies to release a premium model first.

I actually think it makes a lot of sense. People who can afford to purchase a first gen device and who are “Pros” (whatever that means to you, for me I’m a software developer/photographer/web designer) are much more likely to excuse the lack of entertainment made for the platform because they’re using it for work.

Casual users would instantly complain because they expect it to be a Meta Quest with its large library of games."

2025-02-23,"Re; high end headsets:  pimax , varjo , etc

Who said you need safari to watch all media?  I mean Netflix doesn't have an app on Meta anymore either, so they want a browser.  YouTube there's a great plugin to make the watching experience good.  But the other streaming services all have apps.   and there are a plethora of vr180/vr360 players for porn,  the major ones have AVP versions (4xvr, moon, skybox etc)

I don't know what you mean by Apple being behind on gaming vs Linux - the same Proton solution exists for Mac so you can play Diablo 4 or Helldivers 2, and heck Apple even supports it for game devs if they want to port their game!  and lots of top games are being released for Mac (RE7 and 8, Baldurs Gate 3 , the latest assassins creeds, death stranding, etc).  

I game all the time on he Vision Pro with a game controller - my ps5 Xbox or PC games look and sound amazing.  And I have VR controllers to do PCVR streamed to the vision where they look incredible.   

I recognize that weight and comfort is subjective , but I think it's graded on a bell curve with this device, lots of alternatives are less comfortable and get a pass. Eg. Quest 3 isn't comfortable out of the box at all, third party straps abound."

And maybe it’s just me, but I don’t remember oculus in 2012 with their first product having a huge game library? Doesn’t the quest only have 2000 native apps anyway whereas the avp had 2500 last I checked? Also 1.5 million iPad compatible apps?

That seems to be what Apple is doing herethe main stream Apple vision will come"
2025-02-23,"The price for cutting edge tech, in a vacuum, isn't even that crazy.  Let's remember that your average home PC in the early 90s cost $5k+ in inflation adjusted dollars.  Problem is in 2025 the VP does not exist in a vacuum, and people are already spending $1k on a phone, $1k+ on a laptop, and any number of other tech gadgets that these days are very advanced, of high quality, and provide lots of utility.  

In that environment, VP needs to deliver a *reason* for its existence, and so far there aren't many.  Apple is trying to define a new method of 'spatial computing' but so far has failed to really deliver a compelling vision of what that is.  Virtual monitors and 2D apps we can already use on our existing devices isn't it.  

Apple needs to lead the way with *actual* spatial software unbounded by application windows and traditional computing paradigms.  It should be capable of those traditional things of course, so it's a good foundation, but it needs to be a lot more.  There should be spatial versions of Final Cut, the iLife apps like GarageBand or iMovie, Maps, and new apps not yet imagined.  Of course what those applications look like, how they function, and whether they are better or more efficient than existing 2D applications are open questions and problems to solve.

The final and primary great advantage of these headsets is their capacity for highly immersive and transportive experiences. And here, Apple has made some headway but also remains behind competing products or justification for $4k hardware.  And in this case too, one questions whether people actually desire these kinds of experiences and value them highly.

Long story short, in my view there is still a lot of work on the software side before these products stand a chance of breaking into the mainstream.  Like, *a lot*.  I feel like we're not even 10% of the way there and basic foundational principles are still undefined."
2025-02-22,Just because one doesn’t have $4000 to drop on Apple products doesn’t mean they’re “starving”. The price is 100% the issue. There are way more people without Apple vision and MacBooks than there are people who have them. That is due largely to the price.

2025-02-23,"It's 100 grams lighter as you said (which isn't negligible) and that's with a battery on the headset.

And the weight is better distributed as well."
2025-02-23,"It seems it's perfect for your uses and that's absolutely fair.

But my original point was that the general public doesn't want to fiddle with stuff. Read your comment from the point of view of an average person. No Netflix app, needing a plug in to make YouTube good, having to use Whisky or the Porting Kit, or Crossover to play games (or streaming through the browser)... 

Doesn't sound so easy, does it?

You mentioned 5 games, but check the most popular games right now on Steam? Counter Strike, Dota, Pubg, Marvel Rivals, Kingdom Come 2, Apex Legends... Only Dota has support for Macs. Look at trending games, same deal. You get 1 out of 10 with any luck.

Gaming on Apple systems is subpar. And that's fine, we know what you get with a Mac. But the average person doesn't want to fiddle.

With all these compromises, it's gonna be tricky.

I know gaming and that stuff won't change. So my hope for the next one is lighter and more comfortable."
2025-02-23,"I don’t think either device, outside of forced use, is something that a daily device. There isn’t enough content on the Vision Pro, which is an issue."
2025-02-22,Wholeheartedly agree
2025-02-22,It’s a dead end.  Meta has struggled with collapsing sales for the last several years because people don’t want another game console. So they’re focussing on mixed reality use cases the same way android XR and Vision Pro are
2025-02-22,Wdym?
2025-02-22,I'm sorry
2025-02-22,Because you have a poor mindset
2025-02-24,"Again, no, they don’t. If Vision Pro’s use case were clear, people who do have the money would be buying them. And then you’d see a version that was actually for the masses and priced accordingly. 

But those of us who can afford a Vision Pro *aren’t* buying them. This means that we’re not going to see a budget version. None of my coworkers owns one, and we’re all smack dab in the middle of the target market for early entry tech products. We *are* the devs that should be making a use case for Vision Pro. 

The first version of most tech products is overpriced and underperformant. But if it’s good enough, useful enough, solves a problem that those of us with money have, we’ll buy it enough to cause economies of scale to kick in and drive down the costs. Vision Pro simply doesn’t have the utility."
2025-02-22,"part of the surprise from me is because he's an ally, also just his general vibe. i've only been to utah for a week & have only met a couple mormons outside of utah, but the feeling mormons usually give me are just kind of a reserved & plain vibe.

2025-02-22,About a quarter of the regular people I know from Utah are Mormons and they are some of the most ordinary semi-religious people on the planet.
2025-02-22,Yes and they also cancelled the hololens.
2025-02-22,iPhones and iPads? Plenty. Lines literally out the door on release day
2025-02-24,Yes. You and I both will probably be dead by then :-)
2025-02-22,I’m cheaper than a pro xdr display
2025-02-22,"A massive external ultrawide monitor that’s visible in any lighting conditions or location. Not sure how a phone would do anything like that. Or put yourself in an imax theater to watch a movie in spatial 3d. Tbh I have no idea why you’d pick a phone to compare it to, i don’t use the two devices in remotely the same way."
2025-02-23,Got it: you don’t like it so nobody can like it.
2025-02-22,Are you . . . are you selling a Lamborghini for $7?
2025-02-22,I want you to apologize for insinuating I lied about wearing the vision pro
2025-02-25,"I don’t know what response you were hoping for. You say that I’m one of the biggest purveyors of clickbait garbage and I’m to respond “why thank you, dear sir—it is kind folks like you that help pay the bills!” Get real."
2025-02-22,"iPad apps are opt out , not opt in.  So most just work.  The issue with YouTube and Netflix is that Google and Netflix explicitly disabled Vision Pro support.   Netflix has abandoned their  Meta quest app, so that is by design."
2025-02-22,"It’s great!

Though I strongly recommend getting a head strap like this for long sessions, the two straps included with the VP are shit

https://www.globular-cluster.com/CMA1.html"
2025-02-22,"So I use it for coding every day, the Mac virtual display is obviously the best way to do this, the ultra wide screen is incredible  .  I also use working copy for iPad for git access natively , and Blink for native shell or VScode.  Tailscale lets me tunnel to any remote box I need to, whether for ssh or RDP or VNC or Moonlight."
2025-02-22,"The best game of all time, you say? 😏"
2025-02-22,"I’m not asking them to remake Zelda. I said “like Zelda”. I don’t want to slice fruits in 3D. I don’t want to play immersive chess. 

There’s a Zelda knock off called Ocean Horn, if they actually made that immersive and 3D with a better story I’d be happy."
2025-02-22,"They did exactly that with the HomePod minis and Mac mini, original MacBook Air, the list goes on…."
2025-02-22,"It’s almost like you’re unaware of Apples product roll outs, since that’s exactly what they usually do."
2025-02-22,"[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24181106/apple-vision-pro-team-cheaper-headset](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24181106/apple-vision-pro-team-cheaper-headset)

I’ve been reading articles such as this left and right. So unless these are all false or they’ve changed their minds, I think a cheaper model is exactly their plan."
2025-02-22,"I obviously don’t have insider knowledge but I thought they basically hit their sales target? They made a certain amount and they sold a certain amount. 

People purchased it, early adopters. 

They made the product for early adopters, tech enthusiasts, pros who have a specific use case, and people with lots of money to waste on toys.

I was actually paid by Apple to provide a LOT of feedback for about 6 months straight. I had to do weekly check ins, share how I was using it, share any pain points, share what I thought was missing, etc. So in a way they released a product to get real world feedback to improve their second gen and their cheaper model."
2025-02-22,Same could be said for the iPad
2025-02-23,"That’s funny, I started typing out the Tesla example with the Roadster 1 as well as Model S and Model X which were al released prior to their cheaper Model 3 and Model Y… but I figured I’d get downvoted for talking about Tesla. I own a model 3 but even I don’t like talking about Tesla any more."
2025-02-22,"I took “Mfs are struggling out here” and used a different word. My bad?

There are more people who haven’t used a Louis Vutton purse than people who have. I don’t think it’s a popularity contest, not at that price point."
2025-02-23,"My point is It's a first gen device , that ain't targeted at the general public.  There arguably is no general purpose mixed reality headset yet that doesn't involve copious fiddling.  

Meta quest's lack of fiddling is focused squarely on standalone gaming, as soon as you want to consume media etc outside of YouTube it's a faff and fiddle.  So I am squarely talking in the context of early adopters and folks that cluck on Reddit."
2025-02-23,"There is literally more content on the Vision Pro than I know what to do with, and I'm in it 7 hours a day.  Movies, VR games, 2D games, videos, desktop, social media,  I swear it's not forced :-). Mostly for work but also pleasure."
2025-02-23,I mean that you act exactly like your username would lead me to believe.
2025-02-25,"AGAIN yes, yes they do! Even if it was this amazing product that everyone felt would benefit them - it’s still out of reach for most people to just spend 4 grand on an Apple Vision Pro, I gotta ask at this point, do you read the news? Are you aware of the state of things? Pull your head out of your ass! Jesus Christ"
2025-02-22,That’s cool he’s an ally
2025-02-22,"Not in absolute numbers though. The ""success"" you expect the VP to be is on the level of current day Apple products which is just arguing in bad faith.

I don't know if you're living in the the past but the days of an Apple product 1.0 selling gangbusters and changing the world is over and has been for many years."
2025-02-22,Why would I want that instead of an actual monitor or to watch an imax movie alone? Like what is the use case for these things
2025-02-22,Answer the question
2025-02-23,Lmfao you haven’t
2025-02-25,"I wasn’t looking for a response. Your content in the recent past always felt like you had to throw negatives into the story regardless of what was being discussed (especially if it was Apple content). It got old and tired and I was an early fan. Your older videos tended be measured and offered substance. Kind of like the recent piece you did on the printable desk organization system.

What I find disturbing is how badly this got under your skin. Why, if your numbers are good and your engagement is high would you ever consider reaching out in response the way you did!? Water off a duck’s ass man. I’m literally a nobody in relation to this arena. Just a guy throwing out his opinion online."
2025-02-23,Is it hard to wear for extended periods then? Too heavy?  Do your eyes get tired wearing it?
2025-02-23,"Sounds almost like what I want.  I'm assuming you still need to use a physical keyboard and mouse?  Could you remove one of these devices from your workflow, or are they essential for any form of productivity?"
2025-02-23,Did I stutter?
2025-02-22,I don’t know a single person with any of those items. I wonder why 🤔
2025-02-23,That’s not how it works with the phones or watches. I don’t pay much attention to any of the other products because I don’t own them and don’t plan on it.
2025-02-23,They kept cutting back production. They then spun the early adopter line to account for the terrible sales.
2025-02-22,"Except the iPad has sold 700 million+ units in the last 15 years. It has great developer support, and I see people using them all the time. The AVP has sold tens of thousands of units, developers aren’t making even basic apps for it, and I’ve never seen one in the wild."
2025-02-22,"What? Louis Vutton is ridiculously overpriced. What point are you trying to make? If those bags were cheaper, more people would have them. If Apple vision wasn’t going to cost me a few checks, I’d have one as I’m sure many others would too. If MacBooks were priced closer to other cheaper laptops I’d have one as well. It’s always been about the money, but capitalistic corporate greed is getting out of control, especially when you consider life is just getting more and more expensive for us regular non rich people."
2025-02-23,Sure you are :)
2025-02-23,How so?
2025-02-25,"When the wealthy aren’t buying your luxury product, it’s doomed. The wealthy are not price sensitive: they’re *wealthy*. 

That’s what I’m saying here. It has absolutely *jack shit* to do with your ability to buy one and everything to do with the fact that the target market (rich people) didn’t beat a path to Apple’s door on this one."
2025-02-23,"Because the monitor can be as big or small as you want it, where you want it. Because you can see it without issue in direct sunlight. I use mine all the time when I'm away from my desk but still want a large monitor. Use your imagination, seems like you are trying really hard to actively dismiss it. You compared it to a phone for fucks sake.

I get that this sub and some people like yourself have a hate boner for this thing and will actively shit on it any chance you can get, but at least be honest with your argument."
2025-02-22,"Yes, and then I’d try to trade it for a Vision Pro."
2025-02-23,If I prove it to you will you apologize?
2025-02-23,"Regardless of how heavy or light a vr headset is, the head strap defines how hard it is to wear for extended periods of time.

The head straps that come with it suck balls.

One of them forces you to wear the VP like very tight ski googles. Which is fine for an hour or two, but after that it’s not very comfortable to have something so tight of your face. If you don’t tighten it enough then the weight of the device will sit on your cheekbones.

The other one belongs in the trash. It pulls the VP towards your face but it mostly is held up by your cheek bones.

Both of them suck.

The strap I linked is held completely by your head and the VP does not rest on your cheekbones at all. I regularly wear it 8-9hrs a day with zero issues.

Eye fatigue is a different issue which is not isolated to the VP. It happens with all headsets and with monitors too. It doesn’t bother me too much though!"
2025-02-23,"If you’re using a Mac laptop, you can just use the built-in keyboard and trackpad, and automatically switches context with your gaze.   But yes, otherwise an external Bluetooth keyboard and mouse or trackpad is needed if you want to code.  I would say a mouse or trackpad is optional with native apps as the eye tracking is very precise, but is necessary if you want to do remote desktop stuff because that UI isn’t really quite designed for eye tracking, and it depends on the app you’re using to remote in as to whether the eye tracking will work as a mouse.  (the Windows remote app does do this translation quite well, Moonlight doesn’t because it’s targeting a game pad, and Mac virtual display doesn’t because it assumes you have the keyboard and mouse already associated with the Mac at least)"
2025-02-22,Probably because you don’t know that many people
2025-02-22,I find it especially hard to believe you dont know anybody who owns a Macbook Air lol. Its the most basic laptop on the market
2025-02-22,You got me- they don’t actually exist because it’s fake news and all an internet conspiracy to win an internet argument against atcriidp.
2025-02-23,"Ah, so you admittedly don't pay attention to their various business models, yet speak as if you do. I'm all caught up now, thanks!"
2025-02-23,"You say that isn’t how it works with their phones the week they launch a new SE lol

There’s also an SE line of watches too"
2025-02-22,"There are literally hundreds of apps for the Vision Pro, and thousands for the iPad that are compatible with it, and they sold hundreds of thousands of units.  The first generation iPad wasn’t a huge seller, the iPad 2 was the smash. What developer Support is missing on the Vision Pro?  It has great developer support.  But it’s a niche device at the moment."
2025-02-22,">  What point are you trying to make?

Luxury items are not about the price, but the exclusivity and status. Vision Pro isn’t a commodity, it always was a luxury. Being an early adopter of a product that becomes genre defining also has its own status symbol. 

For better or worse, you aren’t the target and being able to sell one to you doesn’t matter. Hell, total sales numbers probably don’t matter so much for Vision Pro to see if Apple should continue exploring the space."
2025-02-23,"Rude, incredibly stupid and misinformed comments all over the place?"
2025-02-23,"I get that you think you understand the position, but I’ve yet to ever hear a compelling reason why I would chose this over my laptop, desktop, phone or iPad for any task. 

It’s not a hate boner, its frustration with the wasted cycles on this thing when their other products have gotten shitty"
2025-02-22,Now that’s a big brain take right there. I don’t know a lot of people got it 😂
2025-02-22,It’s really not though. There are much cheaper more affordable laptops that do the same thing a MacBook does. Why is that such a crazy concept to grasp? Everyone doesn’t feel like overpaying for a laptop.
2025-02-22,Nobody suggested that but ok. Whatever you say.
2025-02-23,"You’re acting like Apple releases something, then makes a better version, and releases it for cheaper. You’re dead wrong but ok."
2025-02-23,"Now ask yourself is the se flagship? In my original comment I said Apple doesn’t release something, then make a newer BETTER one and release it for cheaper. They have cheaper alternatives if you want to sacrifice specs for your dollars. Tf are we even talking about lol"
2025-02-22,"No Netflix. No Youtube. No games. No real reason for anybody to buy one. Why would I want to go into a self-contained silo where I can use iPad apps for 2 hours until the battery dies, when I can use iPad apps on an iPad while still living in the real world?  
Also, the first gen iPad sold 15 million units."
2025-02-22,I agree with you there I am definitely not the target audience. I always see things insanely expensive and think who tf is buying that? I forget there’s rich people without a care or struggle in the world who aren’t pressed over money. How nice that must be.
2025-02-23,What’s being rude have to do with my username? I’m not u/rudetranssexual
2025-02-23,Ok. 👍 you are misinformed
2025-02-23,Meta Quest doesn’t have Netflix anymore either.   YouTube is coming…. Google is waiting for Android XR to ship first.
2025-02-23,Supercuts works for Netflix and Amazon and YouTube is just fine in the browser. You’re just over complicating everything.
2025-02-23,"There are literally dozens of games.  The meta quest has no Netflix either..  YouTube is coming once android XR releases with Samsung.  Plenty of reasons to buy one for productivity or for the best movie watching experience in the world.  If you’re happy with an iPad, stay with an iPad.  For myself and a lot of others, it’s a life-changing device."
