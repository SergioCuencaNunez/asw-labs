2023-03-28,"Another nice little extra that not too many people seem to mention is that if you get them engraved, your engraving shows up on the phone when pairing."
2023-03-28,ThanksÔ∏è I want to know new AirPods Pro 2 delay while making music by logic pro or play some rhythm game
2023-03-28,She can sell you the Apple product better than Apple themselves
2023-03-28,"Getting delivered tomorrow. I‚Äôm very excited because of YOU! 76 years old, and love tech!"
2023-03-28,"Just got mine, the anc and sound quality update are pretty noticeable than the first gen. And the volume touch control is so convenient."
2023-03-28,Apple actually needs to pay iJustine for all of these reviews for real for real because she sells the product and is the epitome of an Apple personality. I can see her apart of the event one day. Love it.
2023-03-28,"I just received mine too and they are really worth the upgrade from the old Pro! Sound quality has noticeably been improved and now they don‚Äôt ‚Äúscream‚Äù anymore, if you lay with them against a pillow, like the old ones did, that‚Äôs actually huge! - I can really tell that transparency mode (my preferred mode) has been improved too - and if you get them engraved directly from Apple, the engraving even show up in the 3D animation which shows every time you connect them to your iPhone  All in all, classic Apple magic!"
2023-03-28,Thanks
2023-03-28,"Got mine Friday, had the previous pro‚Äôs since they first came out. 100% worth the upgrade, the ANC does feel 2x better and the XS ear tips, as well as the volume control (and battery life) is so convenient."
2023-03-28,"Mine just arrived and i'm blown away with the ANC and Spatial Audio (never tried those before), also the speed of connection between devices is super fast!"
2023-03-28,"I just ordered mine today. I got the original AirPods Pro back in 2019 and had to replace them a couple of times due to the cracking/static sounds in the ears. I am having the same issue again, so even though these are great I would HIGHLY recommend AppleCare+ for these. You will likely need replacements at some point!"
2023-03-28,I‚Äôm good on AirPods for now. I have the first gen pro‚Äôs and the Max‚Äôs but I‚Äôm glad everyone who couldn‚Äôt use the older one can use them now! They‚Äôre so great!
2024-03-27,I just joined the Apple ecosystem coming from  Samsung for 8 years. At first Samsung was great but as the years went by the performance just seem to not get any better or maybe even worse. Now I may be new to Apple but all their products just seem to work in tandem so well. I am very eager to see how they perform 1 year from now. Very excited for my journey with Apple and iPhone 14 pro max over then new few years.
2023-03-28,"Personalize spatial audio is also available for airpod pro 1 its available on ios 16 I‚Äôm currently using it and the sound of my airpod pro sound so dolby after i personalize my spatial audio, it‚Äôs an interesting thing honestly, even when I‚Äôm listening to a stereo music it sounds dolby with the personalized spatial audio."
2023-03-28,Thanks for such great content!
2023-03-28,"Just received my Airpods Pro 2 (Australia), they are absolutely awesome. My previous airpods were the old gen 2 and it is night and day. Sound better than my Bose NC700, but not close to the Focal Clears:) In summary for a portable wireless headphone, it should do the job nicely for anyone in the Apple ecosystem and satisfy to the most extent even hifi junkies with Iphpnes on the go. Enjoy! Oh, stayed tuned for a near lossless new audio codec from Apple in the coming months, but you'll need the iPhone 14 or Watch Ultra with bluetooth 5.3 to take advantage, Iphones 13 and prior top out at bluetooth 5.0"
2023-03-28,Can we take a moment to appreciate the work with that Justine does even on collabs with rosansa
2023-03-28,Mine‚Äôs coming tmr!!
2023-03-28,"I have the same problem as you, Justine! The regular airpods fit my ears so well but with the Pros no matter what tip size I would use they would just always fall out as soon as I‚Äôm smiling or moving around a bit. So I ordered the AirPods Pro 2 and I really hope the extra small tips fit in my ears!!

Update: the extra small tips fit my ear, perhaps I even need the small tip in one ear and extra small on the other - still need to figure that out properly haha. But they sound EXTRAORDINARY compared to the regular airpods and the bass woah!! I‚Äôm so happy ü•π"
2023-03-28,"I didn't buy the original AirPods Pro when they came out, because I tried the ones my friend had and they also didn't stay in my ear. Somehow I didn't manage to check other ear-tips. Eventually I got them in July and enjoying with the ear-tips size S, and now I regret everything, because I bet XS would feel much better! Looking forward to purchase the ear-tips themselves lol"
2023-03-28,"I've been using foam eartips, they make a massive difference, but they are a pain when cold, once warmed up they are great thou"
2023-03-28,Mine is out for delivery today... can't wait to use them. I am very happy about the volume controls.
2023-03-28,"XS ear tips was literally the biggest selling point for me.
Thank you for giving particular focus to that!"
2024-03-27,"i got mine recently with the usb-c, the ANC and Transparency mode are life changing now i pretty much wear them all the time"
2023-03-28,I‚Äôm hoping they have some kind of sale by Black Friday. I feel so naked without my AirPods lol. My first pros started giving me issues so I traded them in and now I‚Äôm just waiting for some sort of discount.
2023-03-28,"I have a pair arriving this afternoon. Not that I was dissatisfied with my current AirPods Pro, but all the hyper-positive reviews I‚Äôve seen persuaded me."
2023-03-28,Everything is life changing you said that too about the first air pod pro I didn‚Äôt buy them until they went down to $99 on Black Friday
2023-03-28,I wish they could do something for the wax build-up. Maybe my ears are just waxy but its increased with pros vs the regular airpods.
2023-03-28,i wish they had a feature to join a party and listen with 2-4 people for like album listening parties or something i know bluetooth's new version will have this but it was just announced this year... would be game changing
2023-03-28,I didn‚Äôt even know they were making new ones! They‚Äôre expensive but there are so many new features that I love!
2023-03-28,"I really like Justine‚Äôs fun and very natural presentation style she has. It shows off her personality and it‚Äôs like a friend telling you how to understand or learn something she knows and not lecturing you to know it. I can see why Justine has over 1 million followers - oh, she‚Äôs beautiful too"
2023-03-28,I think we have similar ears cause I had the same exact issues  But The Xs tips and being able to lower/raise volume from the stem did it for me . Definitely worth the upgrade . Great video!
2023-03-28,"i got these Friday and the sound is just incredible way better than the first gen, got to take my hat off to Apple very impressed"
2023-03-28,It's crazy that they waited so long to put smaller ear tips. For me the first gen airpods could not stay in my ear at all. The pros felt right for me and now I'm looking forward to the airpods pro 2.
2023-03-28,"With the lanyard case, I keep wondering if the magnetic strength of the case is stronger. Wouldn't a hanging case, raise the risk of pods dislodging and falling out? Most cases with lanyards have a tight snap-lock close, no? Weirdly, no one seems to care about this issue, but it seems like a problem."
2023-03-28,You know a pager clip like on the old pagers would be perfect for those. When they are paired with your watch and you have the case clipped to your waistband would be perfect.
2023-03-28,"I was waiting for this, thank god I saw the twitter link lol"
2023-03-28,"It‚Äôs the exact same thing, you know like nobody would upgrade from the first gen pros to these ones, the first gen pros have personalized special audio now too."
2023-03-28,"Actually old air pods pro got update, and you also can scan your face to tune spatial audio as good as possible"
2023-03-28,I also have the first generation and they‚Äôve been acting glitchy so I asked my husband to order this for Christmas for me. I had not even looked at reviews and now I am so super excited to get them!
2023-03-28,"Got to say, my only gripe with the first version of these was the same as you - they just fall out too easily, regardless of the tip I use. Foam tips were uncomfortable and lost the tiny vent which is what made these better in the first place. I think v2 is a little different in shape too, I am curious if these will not fall out without using the third party wings I‚Äôve got to use on the v1 at the moment."
2024-06-30,Definitely worth the price. I don‚Äôt ever treat myself to the newest anything tbh but music is important lol so I‚Äôm happy I purchased them
2023-03-28,it‚Äôs fun to see other people just naturally excited about tech tbh this is a nice video
2023-03-28,"I have a feeling that like during the feature, they might use the speaker grill on the case to use it for Media."
2023-03-28,I always come to ms justine to help make my decisions
2023-03-28,"I think I have a 2015 AirPods. I got it like two or three Christmases ago, yeah they‚Äôre life-changing but they don‚Äôt really stay in my ear. I‚Äôm glad you like them"
2023-03-28,She is amazing ive been following her since iphone 6 came out i love her marketing ability
2023-03-28,"Thank goodness you can now FINALLY track the case, I lose that thing all the time"
2023-03-28,"Thank god I preordered them, mine will be delivered today"
2023-03-28,Just came over to Apple after 12yrs of Android.  Picked up the 14 Pro Max. Waiting for my Galaxy Buds Pros to crap out before I buy these. Great review!
2024-08-29,Best YouTuber ever
2024-03-27,I like Justine‚Äôs enthusiasm and energy.  Nice explanations and points of interest.
2023-03-28,"Your truly selling anything better than anyone  needles to say I‚Äôve went from pro to pro2 and yes it‚Äôs absolutely worth the upgrade because of sound, noise canceling, battery life and they with medium tip fit better than the old pro  thanks Justin"
2023-03-28,I got mine for Christmas and boy oh boy are they amazinggggg! I love them so much and the sound quality is just incredible!
2023-03-28,"Not even an apple user. These are just incredible. They fixed the sound signature. There are still flaws they aren't perfect but they balanced the sound. They are very comfortable. You can hold conversations when music is playing and you can also shut people up. 
I still don't like a lot of products, but when they get it right, they get it right.
These are better than XM4. I'm not sure about Sennheisers or Samsung buds (haven't tried those)"
2023-03-28,This made me even more exciting about them! Thanks! Ô∏è
2023-03-28,Also very excited for the XS ear tips! Gen 1 Pro‚Äôs ALWAYS fell out of my ears
2023-03-28,I‚Äôve had the same issues with the previous Pros fitting my ears (I‚Äôve got small ear canals) so I‚Äôm glad to hear they worked for you! May have to give these a shot!
2023-03-28,You‚Äôre a very enthusiastic tech reviewer Justine! Keep up the awesome work that you do really appreciate itÔ∏è
2023-03-28,I have the AirPod Generation pro‚Äôs and I just purchased the pro 2‚Äôs and haven‚Äôt opened them yet.I like the first gen‚Äôs so far.
2023-03-28,I have the AirPod Pros and they don‚Äôt stay in my ear either when I talk or eat. Excited to get these because I love my AirPods and just wish they stayed in my ear. This is great news! Thanks Justine!
2023-03-28,mine are out for delivery right now and I‚Äôm most excited to try the updated transparency mode.. I hate the way things sound in the 1st gen when I‚Äôm running.. the wind that passes through makes everything sound weird and then I just use my first gen airpods over my pros..
2023-03-28,I cannot wait to receive mine!! I literally have the first gen AirPods and even those felt weird in my ears. I have hope that the Pro 2s will do the old ones justice!
2023-03-28,Mine arrive tomorrow! I cannot WAIT! I'm using og airpods that have been through the wash 3 or more times w/ the case. They still work!
2023-03-28,"As always an excellent review. Would‚Äôve been good if you could‚Äôve tested them on public transport, a bustling downtown area etc. But if I had a Telsa I wouldn‚Äôt use public transport either . As I‚Äôm sure many experience these surrounds regularly. Keep up the great work"
2024-03-27,Very useful pocket size gadget when in need of some quietness.
2023-03-28,"Imma die hard android user, and now you've made me get interested in apples products, I wish they Make you a brand ambassador"
2024-12-27,"I don‚Äôt have the AirPods Pro 2, but I do have the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation. It took me a while to find the right fit, but when I wore the AirPods 3, I kept on having to readjust them. When I returned them and bought the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, they were a perfect fit for me. It took me a long time for me to find the right adjustment. I have tiny ears. I don‚Äôt like the pressure of the silicone ear tips in my ears, so I decided to go with the opened ear design instead."
2023-03-28,"I'm still keeping my first gen AirPods as a backup. But I am SO freaking stoked to receive these in the mail in a few days!

As a guy with misophonia, it occurs to me that I absolutely NEED the 2x noise cancellation in my life."
2024-09-28,So helpful and informative! Thank you
2023-03-28,"I have small ear channels too. I had to put memory foam tips on the 1st Gen AirPods Pro which worked great but need to be changed now and then. BTW, good review on the Apple Watch Ultra. Thanks!"
2023-03-28,"I‚Äôm using the pro‚Äôs 2 right now, and the noice cancelation is truly stunning"
2023-03-28,Is post-production your favorite when making a video? You edit really well.
2023-03-28,Love how this review is so real.
2023-03-28,Love you girl I see you your thing keep it coming thank you so much for your tech reviews awesome as always  Respect!
2023-03-28,I recommend when you got music playing set the audio settings to R&B I promise you you'll be in wonderland
2023-03-28,justine is always so enjoyable to watch
2023-03-28,"I've been using the 1st gen AirPods for workouts as well because the pro version always slipped out and I tried all the different sizes so hopefully, this will be better with the 2nd gen pros. Also, a small thing but a memoji as an engraving? That's friggin awesome! :D The best feature, for me, is the noise cancellation because like you, I often just want the world to not be as loud although I'm not listening to music or an audiobook."
2023-03-28,I can't wait. Mine are supposed to arrive today. The 1st Gen airpods are the only earbuds I can wear for any length of time. So glad they didn't change the design of the ear fit.
2023-03-28,"Following on from your fantastic Apple Watch Ultra review, this review has just helped me decide to purchase both the Ultra & Airpods 2, well done on both reviews & keep up the good work Justine :)"
2023-03-28,"I waited to purchase them, so I could pick them up in store today instead of waiting a week after their release. I was sceptical of buying them til I‚Äôve watched this video. 

Going to pick them up in 2 hours and I‚Äôm so excited thanks to you!"
2023-03-28,I love her genuine reaction that's so uplifting I swear
2023-03-28,"Great video, as always. There is one thing I thought was worth pointing out. Some people might misinterpret your comments that AirPods Pro offer some level of hearing protection in noisy environments (approx. at 3:10 - ""It's actually able to safely reduce the noise around you and bring it down to a safe level...""). AirPods Pro (or any other similar ear buds) don't materially reduce the level of ambient noise coming to your ears, other than the bit that gets blocked out physically by the ear tips (of course, a tighter fit blocks more noise).  Noise cancellation merely offsets the outside noise so you can hear what's coming through the ear buds. As a result, it is tempting to think you are adequately protected from noisy environments when wearing them because you can hear your music at a low audio level. However, these are not a substitute for proper hearing protection in noisy environments (think concerts and construction sites). To experience how noisy things really are with them in, turn off the noise cancelling and assess the noise level without the white noise. And as you say, using your watch to measure the decibel levels of the ambient noise around you is very helpful so you can make informed decisions about your environment. Also, compared to ear buds without noise cancellation it does protect you from your natural instinct to turn up the volume coming through the ear buds to unsafe levels just to hear what's being played. So, AirPods Pro are in some ways safer than those without noise cancellation, but it's not going to protect your ears in all situations."
2023-03-28,What I‚Äôm wondering about these is if they‚Äôll have a similar issue to the AirPods Pro 1 where one of the AirPods will start freaking out with a rattling sound. Would definitely love to see a review after a few months and maybe even see if they survive drops and such since I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs something that could happen a ton too.
2023-03-28,I need these new versions!! I also have so many problems with my airpod pros don't fit all the way.
2023-03-28,"I saw the twitter notification then i opened youtube and didn‚Äôt find you video
So i used the twitter link"
2023-03-28,The whole review I couldn‚Äôt take my eyes off that big honking‚Äô Ultra watch.
2023-03-28,The first generation pros have the personalized spatial audio feature now. I just got the update recently
2023-03-28,"Second gen originals fit and stayed in like a champ!   But after hearing the Pro's i was hooked, until they would not stay in my ears like the originals."
2023-03-28,"I'm still disappointed that they haven't come out with a black option, whats taking so long @Apple ?!"
2023-03-28,I just bought mine today. Like you I had the very first generation that came out 4 yrs ago. I‚Äôm so amazed. It‚Äôs unbelievable. Best Buy had on sale for $199.00 and I had a $15 coupon. Wow the Air Pod 2 Pro‚Äôs game changer!!!!! Great review
2023-03-28,Does anybody know if the first gen airpods pro silicone cases fit the new case of the new ones? Or do we have to buy cases that are now specific for the 2nd gen charging case
2023-03-28,Got mine last week. They are so comfortable and sound really good. My gf has the airpods pro 1 and there is a noticable difference in sound and anc but I wouldn't update if I already had the first gen.
2023-03-28,I love watching unboxings before I get my new products in ahhhhhhh I cant wait.
2023-03-28,What many YouTuber forgot: The case also has a built in  Ô£ø U1  chip which works the same as AirTags. You can now see those directions on your phones and it will show you exactly where they are within a few centimeters.
2024-05-31,I am watching this video by my AirPods Pro 2
2023-03-28,"I just got them, the active noise cancellation is BLOWING MY MIND"
2023-03-28,0:18 those hands‚Ä¶. yeah disproportionate age but who cares!
2024-03-27,"I used to watch iJustine in high school when I started getting into tech. It‚Äôs been about ten years since then, I didn‚Äôt know she was still making videos, since they never showed up for me for whatever reason. ): 
Pretty nostalgic for me, this is my first iJustine video since around 2012/2013"
2023-03-28,"It's def not ""night and day"" regarding the sound quality. It's subtle improvements."
2024-07-30,100% trust iJustine‚Äôs reviews on apple products definitely will be buying these at my cellular service thanks to her
2024-03-27,I‚Äôm upgrading from the standard AirPods (gen 2) and I‚Äôm super excited for these I thought about getting the first gen pros but a few of my friends were having some issues. So I splurged for these and I‚Äôm excited
2023-03-28,"The OG legend iJustine! 

When year did you start following her content? Think I found her in 2010ish."
2023-03-28,Ô∏èAre the Microsoft TEAMS mic issues sorted for Windows with these Pro 2‚Äôs?
2023-03-28,"The personalized spacial audio also works with AirPods Pro 1st gen,just saying. It‚Äôs more of a new iOS16 feature than an AirPods feature"
2023-03-28,I can‚Äôt wit to get mine today. I had a problem just like you with them falling out. I sure hope that they stay in my ears better. Love your videos. Keep up the great work.
2023-03-28,"The fit is important.  But I was able to use mine with no problem, though I don't run anymore (sadly).  What I want is battery life.  6 hours seems good, but I'm doing so little I'd burn it up quickly (like in 6 hours, probably twice daily.  Anyway, thanks again iJustine for an informative review."
2023-03-28,I'm upgrading from the first gen original airpods too! I'm super excited!
2023-03-28,Love how your excited to see the same looking case we‚Äôve seen for years. Ooooh
2023-03-28,"Thank you, iJustine! I was on the fence about getting these because I could never get the 2 pairs I owned (the original and the first pro pair) to stay in. Every time I smiled, ate or yawned, they fell out. You are right, these are a game-changer! I got a pair and they are better than I hoped for. I'm using the XS tips and they make all the difference! I LOVE THEM!  So many improvements! I highly recommend these!!! I love the ANC!"
2023-03-28,I‚Äôve used the first GEN pros since day one every day in construction can‚Äôt wait for my Gen 2s.
2023-03-28,"The old one also didn‚Äôt fit my ears, so I‚Äôm very excited for them now. Also used the 2nd gen AirPods."
2024-06-30,I thoroughly enjoy your videos. very informative
2023-03-28,I got my pair of AirPods Pro 2 and I‚Äôm loving them so much. My favorite feature is the noise cancellation. I get mine engraved
2023-03-28,I just ordered mine and I can‚Äôt wait bc tomorrow they come
2023-03-28,I just wanna say thank you so much for demonstrating the actual find my airpod pro part in ur review I‚Äôve watched so many reviews and you‚Äôre the first to include this part
2023-03-28,I noticed that if you double tap you can‚Äôt change the music unless I am doing it wrong I upgraded from AirPods 2nd generation to AirPod pro 2nd generation so I am really impressed by the sound quality and it is cool that we can use apple charger to charged it  also like find my feature and it shows how to find it in find my feature on each AirPod
2024-03-27,Just got these and they are so good. The sound is nice and punchy. The noise cancellation is mind-blowing.
2023-03-28,"Watching this with my AirPods Pro 2 and can highly recommend them. I came from the normal AirPods first gen so it was a big step for me. The bass is just rediculously good, as well as the overall sound quality. Also 3D audio and active noise cancelation are just so impressive. After more than four years of AirPods first gen they actually are worth the money for me and I‚Äòm from Germany so I actually paid 300‚Ç¨"
2023-03-28,Glad the new AirPods Pro finally work for you!
2023-03-28,I am trying to practice contentedness with my current AirPods Pro but no doubt these have great improvements!
2023-03-28,Received mine today. The XS tips did the trick for me. Game changer
2023-03-28,Just got them they look the same but feel nicer sliding into my ear love them
2023-03-28,"Love u ijustin, u made me an apple ibeliever"
2024-09-28,"This is a really helpful video, as I am a first gen user do to ear fitment as well."
2024-03-27,Just got these and shocked at improvement from my regular AirPods. Not even close and I loved the ones I had
2023-03-28,"she went from looking like a barbie doll when she was younger to looking like a strict teacher , still a compliment, but it‚Äôs weird not watching her content for years and than seeing it pop up"
2023-03-28,I got mine today! They‚Äôre my very first noise cancelling earphones and they‚Äôre amazing!
2023-03-28,Just got my new iphone14 loving it so far!
2023-03-28,"i just got memory foam tips for my airpod pros and they stay so much better. they still kind of hurt my ears, but theyre considerably more comfortable"
2023-03-28,The spatial audio configuration was really cool and useful
2023-03-28,OMG that voice changer confessional at 8:10 literally had me DYING  great video Justine! Very entertaining.
2023-03-28,I did the shake and everything and it stays perfect in my ears  I loved them totally
2023-03-28,Personalized spatial audio isn‚Äôt new nor exclusive to AirPods Pro‚Ä¶ I had iOS16 betas and Personalized spatial audio popped up for my AirPods Max like 2 months ago and I‚Äôve used it ever since.
2023-03-28,Just picked up a pair today my air pods 2nd gen finally gave out so deciding it‚Äôs time for a big upgrade and apple didn‚Äôt disappoint best headphones to ever touch my ears
2023-03-28,Will the extra small tips work on the original AirPod pros???
2023-03-28,"I‚Äôm the same as you iJ, with the APpro gen 1 not staying in your ears. Simply wandering around town and the shops I would be constantly scrunching them back into my ears. Would become painful after a while and make me use them less and less. I think you‚Äôve convinced me to upgrade."
2023-03-28,"When I‚Äôm debating to get any apple products, I just watch Justine and I end up getting them every time"
2023-03-28,Always fun to watch you. Thanks Justine
2023-03-28,Finally Airpods that fit in my ears with the new XS buds.
2023-03-28,I‚Äôve been using the OG AirPods still because of fitment. AirPods 3 fit bad. OG AirPods Pro fit bad but these new AirPods Pro with the smaller tips are perfect.
2023-03-28,Got mine today. ANC is not better. It‚Äôs just the same with Gen 1.
2023-03-28,"As a happy Samsung user, the airpods pro is the only Apple product I own/use and I love it, bought it for the noise cancelling capabilities to be able to sleep with people that snore up a storm and didn't disappoint so excited to eventually get these when mine die (which doesn't look like it'll be any time soon since they even have been through a laundry wash and still survived) lol"
2023-03-28,I needed a bigger version as my left ear doesn‚Äôt seal very well
2024-03-27,"I'm looking to replace my Powerbeats Pro earbuds because unfortunately, they are defective. I'll never buy Beats again! I was afraid at first that the Airpods would fall out my ears while working out but I decided to go for it and buy some. Thank you for this review it was very helpful."
2023-03-28,"I love my AirPods Pro 2 and my iPhone 13 Pro Max a lot!!! I got my phone a month ago and the AirPods on Sunday, instant love for both devices Nice video"
2023-03-28,I‚Äôm your opinion do u like the silicon tips on the pros or no tips on the other AirPods?
2023-03-28,I‚Äôm also ALL about the original AirPods as those are the ones that stay in
2023-03-28,"When iJustine reacts to things, she's better then most infomercials."
2024-03-27,i always like to see how happy you are in trying out new apple product!
2023-03-28,Hey Justine you should do some research about the I phone 14 pro camera
2023-03-28,Upgraded ANC is such a big improvement.
2023-03-28,"I just got mine about an hour ago. I‚Äôm absolutely blown away. Then again, until today I‚Äôve been using the Air pods 1‚Ä¶, yeah, veryh first pods‚Ä¶, not the pro. Yeah, they‚Äôve been in my ears for like 4 years now‚Ä¶, and just the last couple weeks the batteries really started to go. Anyway, I got my moneys worth out of that purchase‚Ä¶, glad these new ones finally came out."
2023-03-28,Still waiting for Apple for a custom equalizer settings and not just preset eq‚Äôs.
2023-03-28,"This video was one of reasons I got mine today. I didn‚Äôt like previous version, but this new is just..incredible"
2024-03-27,The best to do it Justine
2023-03-28,"I just my AirPods pro 2 and the sound quality is amazing, the bass is incredible"
2023-03-28,Thanks iJustine. I just love your enthusiasm for Apple Products!!
2023-03-28,I love the confessional moment
2023-03-28,"I have the same problem with fit. Sadly, I lost one of my original AirPods. Great review! Can't wait to try the new ones. :)"
2023-03-28,The voice change scene got me. That was hilarious. I'm such a big fan and a fellow citizen of southwest PA. Keep up the great work!!
2023-03-28,I also love how you can find each item separately now I lost one of my airpods and was able to find it because it of the new feature and I already had AirPods 1 but once I knew about that new find my feature I ordered the 2‚Äôs asap
2023-03-28,Decided to get one after seeing your review. Thanks. It‚Äùs awesome! Transparency sound quality so natural!
2023-03-28,the airpod pros def needed an upgrade!! i was waiting for it!!!
2023-03-28,"I love iJustine‚Äôs videos. Her personality is amazing and simply draws me in. Excellent work. This video might as well be an ad. I already bought myself a pair. SEE, she‚Äôs that good!"
2023-03-28,"I just bought mine today, I‚Äôm so excited to unbox it."
2023-03-28,"I have to point something out - personalised spacial audio is NOT exclusive to Pro 2, when i installed IOS16 i was able to set it up with my 1st gen ones!"
2023-03-28,"Having brought my pros just a few months ago, I will not be upgrading anytime soon. For me the Pros are the best ear/headphones I have ever owned. But maybe this time next year."
2023-03-28,Why Tim Cook loves ijustin i understood now.
2023-03-28,"I have the same issue with the 1st gen, and is stuck with the og airpods  so looking forward to the Ph launch. Hopefully soon!"
2024-03-27,This is my first time watching a review by you Justine and wow‚Ä¶ such a thorough review on the new AirPods. First of all you have such an infectious radiating smile and your personality screams effervescent and truly authentic‚Ä¶ YASSS BOO!!! Loved watching the entire review from start to finish  brava
2023-03-28,"I‚Äôve tried all  of the ear tips, unfortunately for me they keep falling off. So i‚Äôve ordered ear hooks."
2023-03-28,THE FIRST GEN AIRPODS HAVE THE EXTRA SET OF SILICONE TIPS!! They always have been. I got them 3 months after the launch for the first gen AirPods Pro
2023-03-28,ily ijustine u raised me queen
2023-03-28,"I have never been able to wear ear buds unless sitting in place and occasionally pressing them into place, even the original AirPods. No matter the brand or promises they never stayed in. I just got the AirPods Pro 2 today, and they actually stay in. This product is great!"
2023-03-28,Omgggggg you listened to Selena love you my girlu can‚Äôt even imagine how happy I got
2023-03-28,I have airpods pro Gen 1. I bought the XS eartips just to realize they‚Äôre the se size as the Gen 1‚Äôs small eartips
2023-03-28,I have that same issue with my AirPods Pro popping out of my ears.  I‚Äôm glad to see that they added a smaller size for those of us with tiny ear openings lol
2024-07-30,I really want AirPods this year I have my iPhone watch now I want pro 2 I like headphones that go on your head but I want something different that I can wear in one ear which I watch my kids.
2023-03-28,Just received mine this morning! I‚Äôm using it right now! And it‚Äôs so good.. but too small..
2023-03-28,"I just got my AirPods Pro replaced (thanks recall), do you think the upgrade is recommended?"
2023-03-28,"Hey Justine, how is the noise cancelling if you aren‚Äôt playing any audio? I am similar to you with regards to loud noises so I usually use my Bose QC35‚Äôs to block out the noise. Just wondering if there is any weird feedback when only noise cancelling is turned on with no other audio. Thanks."
2023-03-28,Im also still using the first gen air pods and im saving for the pro 2s
2023-03-28,I just got my 1st gen pro‚Äôs today so I‚Äôm still behind but even these have excellent ANC and Transparency modes so I guess I‚Äôm set for a couple years before upgrading
2023-03-28,The personalized spatial audio also works on the AirPods Pro (1st generation).
2023-03-28,iOS 16 gave spacial audio head scan for the 1st gen as well if anyone was wondering
2023-03-28,"in this video mrs ijustine managed to promote the air pods, the iphone, the iphone magsafe wallet, apple music, apple watches, and an apple watch. All in a video about airpods"
2023-03-28,Thank you for your constant enthusiasm.
2023-03-28,It‚Äôs great wish it was a at command a hearing aid also. With a firmware update. Wow game changer. Not just speakers wow help millions of people sound and hearing
2023-03-28,Do you think this is a big upgrade from the Beat Fit Pros. The Beat Fit Pros fit way better and the noise canceling is about the same as the Air Pod Pros 2.
2023-03-28,That Vice Not piece was hilarious!
2023-03-28,"Nice vlog... very informative as usual. I do have issues with ear phone falling off my ears, though I use samsung products...at least I now know that changing ear tip size will solve the problem."
2023-03-28,I can't get many earphones to fit in my ears either. my right ear is smaller than my left ear and I have Galaxy Buds Live which stay in my ear for maybe 10 minutes and I have the smallest tip on them.
2023-03-28,"calling their sound quality ‚Äúincredible‚Äù is a huge stretch. I got them literally an hour ago, and regarding the sound quality, they boosted the bass and kinda that‚Äôs it. it‚Äôs nice, but not incredible. ANC really is a lot better than on the gen 1 tho."
2023-03-28,"I have the first gen pros, they did have options for ear tips in the box."
2023-03-28,got mine also in the mail today!!! what a big difference from the regular airpods pro fr
2023-03-28,‚ÄúIt stays in!‚Äù yes I‚Äôve heard that a few times
2023-03-28,"Had the previous generation of AirPods Pro and just couldn‚Äôt get them too fit properly, do the XS Tips help with the fit as I found the APP sounded excellent when they fitted right ? Just not wanting too spend the money on them if the fit still isn‚Äôt any better for me"
2023-03-28,Talk about a sales person lol
2023-03-28,Just got some today. Compared to pro 1‚Äôs. They seem bass heavy. I may send them back.
2023-03-28,your so real for this
2023-03-28,Haha ‚Äúthe fox‚Äù comes up often on my Apple Music too because it‚Äôs one of my daughter‚Äôs favorite songs (but who doesn‚Äôt like it?!)
2023-03-28,Very professional how she explains apple products than apple itself
2023-03-28,I Love how this video is for the algorithm Congrats
2023-03-28,"These are the update the AirPods Pro needed and they still have the best transparency mode out there , Sony and Bose still have superior ANC, battery life and probably sound quality though that's more subjective but still these are the best for Apple users obviously."
2023-03-28,They‚Äôre so good.  Apple nailed it.
2023-03-28,The individual headphone makes noise as well. I fell sleep with the right ear in my ears n couldnt find it when i woke up. Until i went on find my and search
2023-03-28,"So apple owes you some sort of commission on the sale of my AirPods Pro 2.  I‚Äôve purchased the original AirPods Pro on 3 different occasions and ended up taking them back each time. I love the active noise canceling but damn things never fit correctly. They were uncomfortable and they just didn‚Äôt stay in my ears. I tried all kinds of 3rd tips but nothing worked. Until seeing this video I had pretty much written off the pros. Low and behold the extra small tips is the solution. They fit great and do not fall out of my ears. I‚Äôve been using the 3rd gen AirPods so it took a little bit to get used to these ones but with in a day I feel in love with the pros 2.  The ANC is just awesome and I love the fact I no longer have attach an AirTag to the case. Great review, thank you."
2023-03-28,I still have the normal AirPods gen 2 and I was thinking of buying these new ones. Are they really worth it?
2023-03-28,You should be the official Brand Ambassador of Apple.. You actually do love Apple its reflective in your videos !
2023-03-28,Also incase you don‚Äôt know the Beats Fit Pro were made after Ô£ø bought out beats so they have a lot of the same features
2023-03-28,"every reviewers turning into apple obsessed people these days, although ijustine has been apple fangirl since the beginning"
2023-03-28,I'm finally thinking about upgrading. Great vid keep it up!
2024-12-27,The lanyard loop also doubles as a antenna
2023-03-28,Hi Justine! Awesome review! How did you record your voice in the last frame (from 8:42 onwards)?  It's crystal clear but I don't see a lapel mic? Or AirPods??
2023-03-28,My question is how is the call quality? My AirPods Pro‚Äôs and beats fit pro‚Äôs pick up background noise and amplifies the crap out of it. Makes it really hard to have a conversation when any loud sudden noises happen.
2023-03-28,"Airpod 3s take a day or so to get used to, but they are my favorite. Try them for a few days."
2023-03-28,I had a similar issue with the first gen pros not staying in my ears as well. I wonder if this version would work better for me because I also reverted back to original AirPods
2023-03-28,adding a lanyard loop but no lanyard is the most apple thing to do. cant wait for the $50 lanyard to come out.
2023-03-28,"Tbh, Justine is the only tech girl that I trust when it comes to apple products. She's in the Apple game for soooooo long!"
2023-03-28,"I bought the 1st Pros in 2020. Loved them but I needed just a bit more smaller of an ear tip like you, Justine.

Now I have the AirPods Max, and oh boy!! The power those give is"
2023-03-28,Mine is out for delivery  cant wait to try it on ü•πü•π
2023-03-28,love the vibe in this video. informative review. thanks
2023-03-28,you know your existence is pretty basic when AirPods are life-changing.
2024-05-31,"I never bothered upgraded my old earphones because they always seem to fall out. even my old ones! Once i found out airpods pro 2 have extra small size, I am very excited to buy this now :D I have not got to try it myself yet, but I have high hopes because the old airpod design was perfect for me. I would even go to the extent of buyin the knock off ones just to have the shape when I was a child with little money."
2023-03-28,I went with Rene Ritchie‚Äôs recommendation of the Beats buds with the large silicon tips that actually stay in and have good bass extension.
2023-03-28,This video is ! I absolutely loved it! The content was so informative and interesting . The visuals were stunning  and the music had me bopping my head the whole time . You truly outdid yourself with this one . Keep up the amazing work and I can't wait to see more from you!
2023-03-28,My AirPods Pro would always fall out as well so I used them for work and my old AirPods for  running/workouts. Thank you for addressing that I‚Äôve bee. Waiting for someone else with that issue
2023-03-28,Can you use old cases with the new ones?
2023-03-28,"If the tips have the same shape (AirPod side), you could compare the 1st gen to these. Would be interesting from your perspective since you haven‚Äôt lived with the 1st gen"
2023-03-28,Still using second gen airpod. Have no reason to upgrade. Quality of the sound is still amazing
2023-03-28,DEFINITELY getting one of these. Thank you!
2023-03-28,"I have the Aipods Pro 1st gen and it‚Äôs the best money I‚Äôve even spent. Won‚Äôt be upgrading yet cause they work just fine, but it‚Äôs good to know they‚Äôre evolving!"
2023-03-28,I got mine yesterday and the lid of the case is loose when you move It side to side and in some songs there‚Äôs not much bass and in others there‚Äôs loads
2023-03-28,"1:00 I'm sorry, is she putting them in backwards?!"
2023-03-28,Fyi - personalized spatial audio also works on the first gen AirPods Pro
2023-03-28,"i have the airpod 2st gen with the stem, 3rd gen and the max's and i absolutely love the fit and quality of all three. contemplating getting these pros so i can still have the noise cancellation and sleep on my side with the headphones in."
2023-03-28,"After buying Airpods pro 2, my life changed. I can smell colors now."
2023-03-28,It would have been super funny if she did the whole review in that dark scene with the altered voice.  LOL!!!
2023-03-28,Love that song!!
2023-03-28,I just bought them about 2 days ago and they‚Äôre amazing to use. Thanks for the heads up on these.
2023-03-28,If y‚Äôall still questioning I LOVE BASS and I wasn‚Äôt satisfied with neither the Powerbeats or the AirPods Pro 1 so I got jabra elites 75 t and they were great for bass loved them almost too much sometimes. just tried the new second gen AirPods Pro and there amazing the sound quality is cleaner and the bass is super punchy and wayyyy better it‚Äôs amazing definitely worth the money if you want new earbuds!!
2023-03-28,"fun fact, u have personalized spacial audio on the first gen too. I was surprised but I got a prompt after the update to do it."
2023-03-28,Definitely buy some foam tips vs silicone ..absolute night and day for both fit and sound
2023-03-28,it would be nice if the airpods were able to cancel noise around you when talking on the phone. My boyfriend is in real estate & does a lot of phone calls at home i would 1000% get him airpods if it could cancel out background noise
2023-03-28,Thanks for the review!  Watched this and then bought them right away!  I have the previous generation and am looking forward to these.  My son can have the other ones as a hand me down haha!
2023-03-28,Currently watching on my 14 Pro Max on my AirPods Pro 2
2024-03-27,My most favourite i- accessories
2023-03-28,I just got mines today and I love them!!
2023-03-28,"""It stays in, this is so exciting!""  You're literally just sitting there, every single earphone created over the past decade will stay in as you sit."
2023-03-28,Did the previous airpod pros not include ear tips at all or is the xs option just a new thing for this version?
2023-03-28,"God, What an exaggeration! = life changing, my ass!  Will I get married (again) thanks to these airpods?"
2023-03-28,I have the same problem that the pros wouldnt fit in my ears that why i still used the second version of the airpods but the new pros with the xs fit finally in my ears when i tested it at apple so im glad they finally added an extra set of tips
2024-03-27,"Great video :) , so recently i got the airpods 3rd gen, apparently i have weird ears too, those things kept falling off and felt really odd in my ear hole, had to return them. I just went for the pros 2nd gen, hopefully ill have a better experience. For now im still sporting the pixel buds lol."
2023-03-28,"That was the best AirPods Pro 2 review I have seen! Question, does it come with a lanyard?"
2023-03-28,They should have made them in black color. Sales would have skyrocketed
2023-03-28,I bought because of your nice presentation
2023-03-28,They had the extra set with the last version too
2023-03-28,"I can‚Äôt wait for when mine come, in 30th September (a week from now!!)"
2023-03-28,But then again. You‚Äôre making me change my mind because I like the idea of the Wynyard in the find my AirPods features something to think about
2023-03-28,What's the advantage of Oura ring if you are wearing Apple watch all the time? Or vice versa
2023-03-28,"Nice to know there‚Äôs a volume control. I couldn‚Äôt believe the old
Pros didn‚Äôt have that for the price"
2023-03-28,"No lanyard with my airpods pro 2.  I did buy one separate from the apple store, can't get it on, it did not thread through, so I am returning the lanyard."
2023-03-28,"something went wrong in this world if I have to wait 2 minutes to ""configure"" my earphones just to listen to a song"
2023-03-28,"She is like me, I have used the AirPods Pro, but they kept falling out, now, a whole different story!!! They have not fallen out of my ear‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm super excited about this!"
2023-03-28,any feeling of being like a cave when in noise cancelling mode and talking to someone on the phone?  Stuffiness afterwards?  Just curious
2023-03-28,They need a xl tip as well
2023-03-28,Lmao did anyone think that Justine said ‚Äúfriendly whores‚Äù instead of a ‚Äúfriendly horse‚Äù when she was singing
2023-03-28,"Love that Justine doesn‚Äôt question what ‚Äú2x more noise cancellation power‚Äù actually means. Does anyone know how that‚Äôs quantified exactly? But no, Justine just says ‚Äúimpressive‚Äù."
2023-03-28,"I absolutely LOVE my AirPods Pro 2, I‚Äôve had them for a week. Thanks for the video!!"
2023-03-28,I looooooooooovvvvveee the way you review AP2(all those emotion)! this is the first video I saw from u and I completely fall in love with u hahah! I really doubt about buying AP2 but I buy it just because of u ! Subscribed immediately!:D
2023-03-28,"Can you test if the airpods new transparency removes wind sounds, when your fx running?"
2024-03-27,I will also be upgrading from 1st gen ( I lost them  )
2023-03-28,Tim Apple should hire iJustine to do presentations for Apple products.
2023-03-28,I love how the Apple Watch ultra looks on her wrist. Not as big as expected!!!
2023-03-28,My issue i have been having with them is for some strange reason one bud does not always charge
2023-03-28,Thanks for the beautiful review. I'm receiving mine tomorrow.
2023-03-28,It‚Äôs crazy how she dose not work for Apple but she got me to buy the iPhone 14 and AirPods
2023-03-28,Stemless design is still the best though so Pixel Buds Pro or Galaxy Buds2 Pro for me. Way more life changing than those stems lmao
2023-03-28,"I'm upgrading from the first gen AirPods Pro, since 2X ANC, and 30% more listening time is a big deal for me."
2023-03-28,I definitely wanna try now that they added the extra small tips‚Ä¶ finally they realize some of us have smaller ear canals
2023-03-28,Am gonna buy them for sure
2023-03-28,Can you open a set of those headphones and find out if there is really a H2 chip or did apple just  tweak the last pair of air pods pro and make people wait 3 years to build up anticipation‚Ä¶
2023-03-28,"Thanks for the best video review yet! When you say the BlueTooth connects much faster, about how much difference in seconds would you estimate?"
2023-03-28,Just got mine!  Charging now.  Can't wait to watch The Orville on Apple TV with the tonight!
2023-03-28,Totally agree watching this review will make you buy the product. Thanks Justine
2023-03-28,Got 'em. They definitley sound better than my 1st gen Pros. They finally have proper bass.
2023-03-28,"Bought them day one. Sound substantially better than the originals, especially the bass.  ANC is better too but I don't think it is 2x.  Easy buy for Apple users."
2023-03-28,That watch looks so big on your hand
2023-03-28,This is an amazing upgrade. Sad it isn‚Äôt USB C. Even Nintendo uses USB C.
2023-03-28,"Interesting you said that you use AirPods for editing. I have always had an issue with Bluetooth headphones having a big enough latency to be distracting when working or even watching video. 

Do you notice any latency when using these for editing?"
2023-03-28,"Hope they‚Äôre better than the normal AirPods Pro mainly due to the bad microphone which i believe is a software bug anyways but who wants to spend ¬£250 on a pair of AirPods that don‚Äôt work right‚Ä¶ whenever I‚Äôve wore them during a zoom meetings people would complain they can‚Äôt hear me well, even used my warranty to exchange them with no avail"
2023-03-28,Gotta say still the champ is sennheiser momentum 3 for music
2023-03-28,Pro 1s also now have personalized spatial audio
2023-03-28,What is the different between Airtag technology and the new Airpods Pro?
2023-03-28,I have Airpods pro but I have to upgrade to Airpods pro 2  because they made the way I want to use. Thank you Justine  for your review May GOD bless you more
2023-03-28,"You could have picked up some after market tips for the original airpod pros, i prefer foam tips so that's what i did ."
2023-03-28,"Justine, I got the Apple Watch ultra today but they only had the Alphine loop band. I see that you have the black/gray trail band. Can I get one too? It‚Äôs not available anywhere yet and i was told it‚Äôs a $100"
2023-03-28,Not me listening to this video with my new AirPods Pro 2 lol
2023-03-28,It would be cool if you could play music out of the case so not only do you have AirPods but then you also have a portable speaker
2023-03-28,"Literally said in the original Airpods Pro Review that she LOVED the fit.  THIS video, she explains how the original airpods pro earbuds CONSTANTLY fell out of her ears, but NOW she loves the fit again apparently because they don't fall out with the new smaller tip earbuds.  If earbuds fall out constantly because they don't fit right on you, those earbuds would be something to stay away from, no?  Makes you take her reviews with a grain of salt IMO.  Can't say an earbud fits great two years ago, when they constantly fall out and that you love the fit on the new ones because they don't fall out now.  MISLEADING  PAID REVIEWS NEED TO STOP!"
2023-03-28,Imma get these next year. I was gonna get them this year till my parents got me AirPods for Christmas
2023-03-28,Mine are due to arrive in 2 hours. cannot wait!!! Even more hyped after watching this.
2023-03-28,Lov the new AirPods I will get some soon now
2023-03-28,the old airpods pro‚Äôs have the ear tips too i thought
2023-03-28,The 3 holes on the bottom right are speaker holes...what is the single hole on the left for? You glossed right by it!
2023-03-28,"As a Norwegian, I have to thank you for liking Ylvis' song ""the Fox"". I am proud of my country, thank you"
2023-03-28,"They‚Äôre so life-changing, they don‚Äôt even work. Between the audio equalization issues and the disconnecting issues, what‚Äôs so great about these they don‚Äôt work"
2023-03-28,U r awesome justine!!!!
2023-03-28,I still got the first generation of AirPods so hopefully I can get these AirPods Pro soon
2023-03-28,"Although she is best in everything reviewing,showcasing and reaction just everything Ô∏èÔ∏è"
2024-09-28,I love them !!!
2023-03-28,"IDK about you, but I'll be waiting for it to come with USBc instead of the lightning connector. I'm so excited about getting rid of the lightning connector you dont even know! The time for cheaper, better quality and faster charging cables is coming! In fact, I vow not to buy a single Apple product with the lightning connector ever again, thats how excited I am about the upcoming switch! (Also on a side note; Memory foam tips are far superior to silicone ones.)"
2023-03-28,have they gotten rid of the chime when you put your airpods in your ears? i have been trying to find this out for a while.
2023-03-28,My fave Chief Marketing Officer of Apple. I watch her reviews more than the Apple presentation/ website.
2023-03-28,I recently bought a iPhone 8 and I still have my Galaxy Buds pros so i think i should buy a pair of these
2023-03-28,I‚Äôm here just because of the title saying ‚ÄúLife Changing ‚Äú
2023-03-28,"When it is totally silent and you put noise cancelling on, do you also hear a sort of wind noise? It Is really minimum but without music on you can hear it."
2023-03-28,You should try the Beats Studio buds
2024-03-27,I have the AirPods 3rd generation and was thinking about buying the AirPods Pro 2 are they worth the upgrade as i like my current AirPods but sometimes they fall out and not having noise cancelling is quite annoying
2023-03-28,"I remembered, Happy Birthday Jake!"
2023-03-28,very good job!great updates!!!
2023-03-28,My air pod pros came with different ear bud sizes tho
2023-03-28,Hi Justine. So funny story. I had the first air pods pro and the tips gout stuck in my ear I had a panic attack!! I had to have them removed with tweezers Ô∏è so please tell me these tips won‚Äôt come off easily!
2023-03-28,8:58 - Can they actually switch between phone and mac without having to manually reconnect them on the mac side? For some reason I can only switch from mac to iphone and not back automatically.
2023-03-28,Luckily I got my AirPods Pro 2 second gen for 40 dollars can‚Äôt wait to pick up mine from Best Buy in 2 weeks
2023-03-28,The real game changer for me was comply foam ear tips.  Apple‚Äôs silicone tips just don‚Äôt stay in my ears‚Ä¶. But the comply tips:  Like they‚Äôre not even there
2023-03-28,"NGL, this looks a lot better than the purple"
2023-03-28,First time to get AirPods ever in my life I got these and the most impressive thing is I slept with these and they never left my ears
2023-03-28,If Tim Cook retires I want Justine to become the next CEO of Apple
2023-03-28,When AirPods Pro failed to stay in my ears I switched to the beats fit pro only changing if they update them with more features
2023-03-28,Blew my mind these are hella cool
2023-03-28,Apple should make studio headphones fr
2023-03-28,I just got these for Christmas
2023-03-28,Does transparency mode work with long (curly) hair?
2023-03-28,Hopefully the extra small can help me
2023-03-28,The gen 1 fits well except when lying down it will just fall off
2023-03-28,They stayed in for me to and I was on the fence because rubber ones never stay in my ear
2024-05-01,"hell with dust resistance, I brought them yesterday and I used them so so so carefully, placed them on folded tissues when placing on table and kept them alone in the pocket with nothing else and I am shocked to see the amount of scratchs, they look like months old, paying so much for a premium product and get scratches all over it within 24hrs even though you dont use them, its really not worth it"
2023-03-28,Conveys the content so good just fun to watch
2023-03-28,Did you keep the Apple Watch ultra and what‚Äôs your thoughts on it weeks later ?
2023-03-28,They always fall out my left ear. Then I bought these ugly hook things until I lost them. Well now I have something to look forward to. Thank You iJustine
2023-03-28,I can‚Äôt believe someone would feel so happy about AirPods staying in their ears  good video.
2023-03-28,Wanting The AirPod Max
2023-03-28,Awesome video Justine. Did you end up trading in your silver iPhone 14 Pro Max for the deep purple one? I just came back to apple after being on android fro a few years. I got the space black iPhone 14 Pro 1TB. I love it. It‚Äôs the perfect iPhone. Their best yet in my opinion! I‚Äôm also like you I use the long stem AirPods(2nd generation). They are just the most comfortable. They remind me of the headphones that used to come with iPhones. It would be really cool if they came out with AirPods shaped like the original iPhone headphones. Like the ones that came on the 3GS. Those things were perfect!
2023-03-28,I have spacial audio on my sony earbuds. Cool technology! Sounds like Apple is just catching up!
2023-03-28,Great review as always! You make this so easy! Thanks for all your hard work!
2023-03-28,Can‚Äôt be that great.  We need to hear the cons too
2023-03-28,The gen 2 are insanely good. Worth every cent. They blow the first gen away.
2023-03-28,I just listened to the Fox Song  Absolutely Ridiculous
2023-03-28,"Hi Justine, awesome information.  I still have the first generation AirPods that I use.   Thanks!"
2023-03-28,Woah wait whattt did you say editing with them????
2023-03-28,I currently just got the AirPods 2nd generation and I‚Äôm wondering if I should hand them in to get the new pros
2023-03-28,"Question<  when not using the airpods you put them in that holder case, are they charging when you put them in??"
2023-03-28,"The problem with iJustine is, she's completely bias in her reviews. She's never given Apple a negative review on anything, even on well known issues like the bend gate,  and only has complimentary things to say. Presumably because she knows if she did her false sense of friendship with Apple would forever be ruined. It's a shame as she's just using them as much as they use her, as long as she keeps saying nice things, everything is fine. However that doesn't help the consumer when buying these products.   I seem to remember her review of the trash can mac pro was glowing, yet everyone knew it was terrible."
2023-03-28,Mine are coming today
2023-03-28,"You obviously do excellent reviews (over 7 million subscribers!) but I would request 2 things: reduce the volume of the background music, and include chapters.  Thanks :)"
2023-03-28,"I swear every new apple product, regardless of what improvements were made, are jaw dropping in Justines eyes. Heck, a drop in 0.00005oz from old to new would be the most amazing thing ever."
2023-03-28,Now I want them even more!
2023-03-28,"Hi Justine, I‚Äôve had a quite a few different AirPods now. Have AirPod pros version one and they‚Äôve been a bit unreliable to be honest I‚Äôm on the second pair, I can‚Äôt get them to seal properly either and they are starting to be on their way out. They make a buzzing sound., so going to replace them for the version two"
2023-03-28,I just got mine. Sound quality leaves a lot to be desired. Only slightly better than AirPods Pro 1st Gen.
2023-03-28,The first set of airpod pros have extra tips
2023-03-28,Does personalize audio work with ipad?
2023-03-28,Seriously thinking about upgrading my gen 1s to these just because of the battery update and it‚Äôs nice with the find my

2023-03-28,"Tks,"

2023-03-28,Ear tips are game changing... I get ear tips with practically every earphone I purchase. Even those for $10.
2023-03-28,Why are we excited over features Beats & Raycons have been doing for a long time. She was legit happy they don‚Äôt fall out‚Ä¶ let that sink in. That‚Äôs the absolute minimum a wireless ear piece should do.
2023-03-28,""" Hey look, there's an LED, that lights up!!! WOWWW! """
2023-03-28,"Thanks, it was great"
2023-03-28,"Damn, this is just right after I bought the pros. Bruh I should have waited"
2023-03-28,Does anyone know why my case doesnt wanna charge ?  would appreciate help
2023-03-28,Trying to set up my old AirPod pros with the personalized audio and it will not set up! So annoying
2023-03-28,Does the new case work with the 1st gen AirPods Pro?
2023-03-28,I love how apple spending an additional 20 cents on additional eartips for a $250 product is seen as a huge improvement
2024-03-27,"Hi, can the latest Airpod Pro 2 still be used as a hearing aid for mild/medium hearing loss people? If yes, it what ways has it been improved compared to the previous version? Thanks."
2023-03-28,was there ever an apple product J was not super buzzed to get?
2023-03-28,Omfg it can use the watch chargers!!! And it‚Äôs magnetic!!
2023-03-28,I also bought AirPods Pro2!  Great sound quality
2023-03-28,Me needing the large.
2023-03-28,Perfect video. All questions answered
2023-03-28,Try the beats fit pro they‚Äôre cheaper and sound almost identical to these only they have the ability for heavy bass
2023-03-28,I‚Äôm sure apple just released the xs ear pads just for you
2023-03-28,Nice video iJ!
2023-03-28,Even the XS still fall out :((( does anyone have any recommendations?
2023-03-28,Can u make a vdo of airpods switching audio from iphone to watch when u are away from phone range and with watch while listening.. will it switch
2023-03-28,NORWAYYYY WHAT DOES THE FOX SAYüá≥üá¥üá≥üá¥
2023-03-28,We need more Justine ego video‚Äôs!!!
2023-03-28,a great video by ijustin about air pods 2 generation the sound quality was impressed it's I hope best air pods forever
2023-03-28,"Apple: make video of my new product.

Her: oh my gosh, this new AirPods is game changing!"
2024-03-27,Do u have mic issues with call while in car or outside ? I replaced my pods now but still the problem persists
2023-03-28,The Pro 1s fit but would start to slide out due to ear oilyness. Unusable for me so just use the latest AirPods instead.
2023-03-28,"What about the compatibility of this bud with Windows computer/laptop? I don't use mac, i use Windows."
2024-03-27,Android support would be a great improve and huge market sale
2023-03-28,Have you ever reviewed beats earbuds ? I would love to know how you like them. :)))
2023-03-28,The real test will be if they cancel the noise of a plane engine during flights. Cuz that‚Äôs a deal ma ker for me
2023-03-28,apple is the king of tech
2023-03-28,Honestly the AirPods 3 is just fine unless you was noise cancellation but they should add the volume up and down on the AirPods 4
2023-03-28,They just updated my AirPods Pro (1st generation) to have the individual AirPods precision finding and showing them on the map separately . No need to upgrade
2023-03-28,"These seem like a nice upgrade over the Air Pods Pro 1. Great review, and thanks for sharing."
2023-03-28,"AirPods - Life changer 
Apple Watch - Life saver
iPhone - Name below"
2023-03-28,Love the pros but the rubber ear tips they give you are just the worst no matter the size. I found memory foam ones that work so much better for me.
2023-03-28,How come u didn‚Äôt buy the lanyard? Is there custom ones?
2023-03-28,3:44 spatial*
2023-03-28,"doesnt matter which tips i use, they all fall out of my ears on the earbuds. so i‚Äôm stuck with regular airpods except for the roughly 30 minutes a day in the office when i need to use the noise canceling on the 1st gen pro‚Äôs."
2023-03-28,Justine you are so good I always pray to God to keep his bless on you and always smile and make us smile
2023-03-28,She must be hired by apple for next presentation of similar and more expensive products next year.  Otherwise apple will failed
2023-03-28,I have the first gen pros and had the airpods replaced a year ago via the replacement scheme apple put in place. But I have wanting the volume adjust feature for so long that I will be upgrading
2023-03-28,iJustine : Headphones? life changing!!!! lmao
2023-03-28,You can say hey Siri turn volume down or up when you are wearing them. I like that feature.
2023-03-28,"I wish AirPods pro didnt hurt my ears so bad after just 30-40 min at the gym, i have bought multiple tips and none worked. So i gave them to my lil bro and he wears them for hours with no pain. Only one that with perfectly are the beatsbud pro"
2023-03-28,Did I miss you talk about the volume slide up and down???
2023-03-28,"I going to get mine when I order my iPhone 14pro max and iPad Air 2022 in around 1 month time and I ordered new electric car it should come soon and  
I am going to record them and put it on my YouTube channel so keep eye out and when the new ps5 vr head set comes out it‚Äôs going to be fun"
2023-03-28,Haha next year they‚Äôll add the light on the back too!
2023-03-28,If these sizes don‚Äôt fit you are screwed though! I had to return mine! Love my Jaybirds though haha
2024-03-27,You‚Äôd think someone as experienced as iJustine would not make an error in the very first sentence.
2023-03-28,Your review is amazing! Life changing
2023-03-28,The head shake test should have been with some cannibal Corpse playing
2023-03-28,@3:47 spacial or spatial. Oh. It is again UK and USA.
2024-08-29,Can you show us some features with the Apple Pencil on the m2 Iona‚Äôs pro 12.9 inch
2023-03-28,"Everything is her favourite, favourite colour, favourite box. Review is suppose to be pro and cons not just favourite favourite"
2023-03-28,imagine apple uses the additional speaker for find my as music player??
2023-03-28,"They look pretty the same, however i now know that they have a speaker , and the cable hole made me in order last week a new rubber loop cable  for my BT speaker in matching color and material however i dont  why i didn't get the one with colored beans......
I'm not sure if a speaker on airpods is the future, but who cares?
You also didn't show they show up in IBOK if you connect them"
2023-03-28,"i just received mine, does anyone know if the cancelation of the loud noises with transparency mode works? and how it works? i saw it on the keynote but i haven't heard in in my ears when i make loud noises myself. if that makes any sense."
2023-03-28,They are incredible
2023-03-28,"I rather liked the Quaker parody... what does George Fox say. 

I'll seriously look into getting these, as I've never had much joy with in-ear headphones before, as they always kept falling out, so the XS bud sounds like the right fit for me!"
2023-03-28,can I use the AirPods 2 with my android Samsung????
2023-03-28,Bro get comply foam tips - that is life changing
2023-03-28,You should randomly do a shake test on your next run
2023-03-28,Does it really have two times noise cancellation than previous one or same?
2023-03-28,Time to wait three years u til these go on sale wooo
2023-03-28,"Looking to get pros but first generation are naturally heavily discounted and can get them for about $65/¬£60 than 2nd gen. I‚Äôm not a regular flyer and since Covid WFH so don‚Äôt take noisy public transport. 2nd gen new features would be nice but aren‚Äôt deal breakers. First gen seems much better value and would be fine, right?"
2023-03-28,So funny to see people reacting to those same shit apple brought this year.
2024-03-27,The ooooh aaaah was so real
2023-03-28,"Hey Tim Apple: we, the people, want Justine to be on the actual Apple keynotes"
2023-03-28,"Already got the pros, I'm good :)"
2023-03-28,Life-changing is when you can cure cancer.
2023-03-28,How do they sound compared to the old airpods pro?
2023-03-28,Are these available to order?
2023-03-28,Please compare Sony A7RIV camera with iPhone 14 pro max
2024-03-27,"Hi iJustine this might be a silly question, but i want to ask, what kind of charging pad that you used here ? the one for the iwatch. Thank you in advance :D"
2023-03-28,I am going crazy trying to get it to recognize my ears!
2023-03-28,Why does tie dye look so good on you and yet so painfully average on me
2023-03-28,Amazon has had ear tips for Air Pods Pro since day 1.
2023-03-28,compatability?
2023-03-28,"Can anyone give me feedback on how background noise is being transported to the listener on the other side of the phone? Whenever I use my airpods and e.g. a car drives by or I open a drawer (things that don‚Äòt appear very loud to me), the person I‚Äòm talking to receives these sounds extremely loud‚Ä¶ :("
2023-03-28,"I upgraded from the air pods pro first gen.    To me, it is worth the upgrade."
2023-03-28,Wish the case could be used as a Wireless Bluetooth speaker xD
2023-03-28,I liked the pros ditched them cause they wouldn‚Äôt stay in my ear. So i got the 3rd gen but I missed to noise cancellation so when I heard these were coming out with the xsmall ear parts I got them today day one and I love them
2023-03-28,"I've a question for anyone here.... I normally wear over the ear, ear protection when mowing the lawn, does the noise cancellation actually protect your hearing or does it just not sound as loud but could still damage your hearing?"
2023-03-28,"I‚Äôll probably wait for these to drop price on Amazon to purchase lol hopefully the new tip fits, I‚Äôll try to go to the Apple Store and try them on"
2023-03-28,watching this qith the new airpods
2023-03-28,Good review but for an earbuds video probably would be a good idea to get your hair with a pony tail or something instead of moving your hair out of the way a thousand times.
2023-03-28,"ooh my god, it's happening, it's happening, it's happening......"
2023-03-28,Justine should be an Apple spokesperson
2023-03-28,really is it astronomical? and the best thing is new ear tip you can buy from 3rd party all the time?
2023-03-28,"Good review and to the point, you are the YouTube expert I love!!!"
2023-03-28,I get ear fatigue after 20mins of use.  For me they did not work.
2023-03-28,"When it‚Äôs ‚Äúyour problematic ears‚Äù instead of ‚Äúa problematic product‚Äù, you just know it‚Äôs an Apple product"
2023-03-28,Just got mine. They are so nice
2023-03-28,I‚Äôm hoping these stay in my ears. Be nice to wear these in the gym as their way more discrete than my over ear beats
2023-03-28,"How is the noise cancellation compared to BOSE, Sony?"
2023-03-28,"The AirPods Pro 2 work better for me than the 1st AirPods Pro. The extra small size fit my ears perfectly, the first AirPods Pro kept falling out of my ears. The extra large, medium and small didn‚Äôt fit my ears."
2023-03-28,Nice review
2023-03-28,So mine are not good using to talk on my iPhone 13 so disappointing
2023-03-28,Hahahaha ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a lot of secrets to tell‚Äù
2023-03-28,This was a great ad
2023-03-28,Does the new case fits the first Gen AirPods Pro ?
2023-03-28,I just got them and I love them
2023-03-28,AirPods Pro first generation have extra earbuds as well
2023-03-28,That huge watch and huge phone makes you look like you have been shrunk!
2023-03-28,OMG!!! What does the fox say? Gosh you are so cute!
2023-03-28,They are like a mini AirPods Max. Just got them and they do sound cleaner and tighter than my Gen 1s. So my Max has got a new sound partner. Volume controls do take a while to figure out.
2023-03-28,Great review thank you
2023-03-28,Has anyone figured out yet what the small single hole is for next to the lighting port?
2023-03-28,apple needs you
2023-03-28,I have 1st gen airpod pro‚Äôs. Wondering if the upgrade would be worth it
2023-03-28,Can the new airpods pro also charge on an magsafe charger like the old ones can?
2023-03-28,You haven‚Äôt age day Justine!
2023-03-28,I‚Äôm obsessed with my AirPods first gen but I had to buy the 3rd gen AirPods because they wouldn‚Äôt stay in my ear especially when I ran or was working out as soon as I saw that they saw the XS tip I had to get them.
2023-03-28,Never had AirPods before so I‚Äôm hoping my Pre-Order arrives today :))
2023-03-28,Daaammm you Justin! Now i need to order new AirPods Pro
2023-03-28,isn‚Äôt the personalised Spatial Audio available in all ios16 devices?
2024-03-27,Is it normal to have a white noise sound (kind of like a very faint raining sound) when using Anc and transparency mode?
2023-03-28,Do Airpods work well with Samsung Android?
2023-03-28,These go in ears? well who'd a known that without your graphic
2023-03-28,nice apple ad
2023-03-28,"The three holes on the case are the speaker. What the hell is the other one hole on the case? No one is mentioning it, not even Apple, and it's driving me insane!"
2023-03-28,No free lanyard?
2023-03-28,Always a good time!!
2023-03-28,Is It sweat resistance?
2023-03-28,Never heard of a pair of ear buds being ‚Äúlife changing‚Äù
2023-03-28,The moment air pods can change my life is the moment I know I have failed.
2023-03-28,"Would love to hear some compare of these against the Huawei FreeBuds Pro2 , soundwise !!!!  If someone have both , please let me know. i had the first air pods pro , and the freebuds pro2 are way , really way better sounding for me...  ( dont kill me cause of eco system bla bla .. its only about the sound! ) if the 2nd Apple pros are really that better sounding , i would give them try"
2023-03-28,Me laughing with my Sony WF-1000xM4 plugged in
2024-09-28,She‚Äôs the best salesman apple will ever have!
2023-03-28,Apple owes this girl at least tens of millions of dollars. iJustine has been posting biased ‚Äúreviews‚Äù of Apple products for like 15 years. I hope she got her shill money.
2023-03-28,HIIIIIIIIIII another great review as always
2023-03-28,"Hey Apple, can I order mine with the Justine volume changing sound?"
2024-03-27,so my ears a really small but i don't know if I should use XS or L eartip
7  ago,got mine today I was mad apple didn't give me a sticker did they stop this
2023-03-28,Awesome presentation
2023-03-28,"Still doesn‚Äôt seem like there‚Äôs enough to upgrade if you have the original AirPod Pros which is disappointing considering how long many of us have had them and they have worked so well for me. Also I‚Äôm a little concerned about the fact that you seem to genuinely like ‚ÄúWhat does the Fox say!?‚Äù  Other than that, great review as always!"
2023-03-28,"I just got them and they are pretty much the same as my old ones, except the volume control feature. Disappointed"
2023-03-28,"I find that the noise cancellation in the 2nd generation is considerably worse than the 1st generation, not better."
2023-03-28,I have never owned AirPods but my wife has. The background noise that they pick up while I‚Äôm talking to her hurt my ears. The background noise comes in super loud. I can‚Äôt talk to her while she wears them.
2023-03-28,When using the Apple Watch Charger for your AirPods excites you.............

2023-03-28,The old AirPods Pro can do the personified spatial audio btw.
2023-03-28,Cool review. Well done!
2023-03-28,"May i ask, ANC and sound quality wise, how are these if put in comparison with Sony wh-1000xm4?"
2023-03-28,Do the XS ear tips fit the originals?
2023-03-28,The energy in this video is everything that's wrong with Apple people lol
2023-03-28,"Absolutely LOVE your reviews!! One note though... It's Spatial, not Spacial."
2023-03-28,I broke my airpods 1st generation on the washer and dryer and im so happy with my new purchase of the 2nd gen of airpods and i love it while im watching this video

2023-03-28,Do you have to have iOS 16 in order to take advantage of all the features?  When I tried to pair them up with my phone it gave me a message saying to update or continue without all the features?  Anybody have an answer?  Please help.
2023-03-28,"3:49 there should be a correction: It is ""Spatial"" not ""Spacial"""

2023-03-28,AirPods Pro 2 are the best definitely worth the upgrade the volume button and battery life 6 hours definitely worth the upgrade
2023-03-28,Thank you for the great content.  I want these new AirPods
2023-03-28,"Hum I prefer to wait for a real review with tests carried out by a sound engineer with a real comparison of the first generation and the competition. Even if I like the content, for the objectivity I have a doubt"

2023-03-28,My find my isn‚Äôt working
2024-03-27,3:46 - typo: ‚ÄúSpacial‚Äù. It should be ‚ÄúSpatial‚Äù.

2023-03-28,"Same with me, sometimes I wear aipods , without hearing a music  Just silence"
2023-03-28,Anyone who thinks an upgrade from AAPP to AAPP2 is LIFE CHANGING needs to give their head a shake
2023-03-28,Is her ring made by Apple as well? The iRing?
2023-03-28,"Why am I the only person that‚Äôs annoyed we didn‚Äôt get a new design. I was waiting so long to upgrade my Gen1 AirPod Pros. I was going to go for Watch series 8 too and still that looks the same as all previous gens. I personally don‚Äôt like paying $500-$1000 on something that looks EXACTLY the same as the thing I‚Äôve already had for 3-4 years.

Edit: Also iJustine you‚Äôre speaking so much in this video about the ‚Äònew‚Äô tips as if Apples fixed something but I got these EXACT 3 sets with my Gen1 AirPod Pros like 3 years ago. Your review is majority for the AirPods Pro Gen1 features so your hyped at a 3 year old product because your coming from the standard AirPods‚Ä¶"
2023-03-28,I tried personalized spacial audio lemme just say it did nothing on apple music made for spacial audio

Moment of silence"
2023-03-28,Did anyone try this Airpods Pro 2 with mobile games like PUBG or COD? Is the footsteps from right left front & behind can be heard? Your needful advice will help me.
2023-03-28,Techies Got to keep sayn great things to get things handed to them. Facts
2023-03-28,She should literally marry Tim Cook if the product is also not good still she will say the product is good.
2023-03-28,pretty sure they always offered different sizes? no?
2023-03-28,"iJustine reminds me of the days when Taylor Swift would win an award, & she would act so shocked & surprised."

2023-03-28,You just sold me I‚Äôm running to apple
2023-03-28,"I actually hear more people talking about them not staying in the ears than people who do. I am starting to think we are the majority. I just got them, and really like all the features, but the fit just isn‚Äôt perfect. And they keep feeling like they are about to fall."
2023-03-28,Are they better than the beats by kim?
2023-03-28,"Hi Justine, or anyone here who knows if the AirPods Pro 2 fit in snugly in the previous AirPods Pro cases, despite the subtle dimension of the two? Thank you in advance."
2023-03-28,"am i the only one who is suffering from muffled sound when i listen musics with dolby atmos ON? this is terrible feature and all songs sounding like distorted a lot. vocals disappearing , volume very low .. is Apple going to release patch something and fix dolby atmos issue? for now i turned it off  and listening songs much better audio quality.. but in this case, this feature is completely useless. I'd like to hear everyone's experiences and opinions"
2024-03-27,Don't think for a minute that Apple is not capturing and storing  your images of your face!
2023-03-28,i love Apple
2023-03-28,‚ÄúSpatial audio‚Äù is spelt wrong as ‚ÄúSpacial audio‚Äú in this video

2023-03-28,"I wish I could tolerate the ear tips. I hate hate hate ear tips.

2023-03-28,I never know if there‚Äôs a real difference from the new AirPods Pro or the iPhone 14?
2023-03-28,"Read Me Beb , my AirPods pro are next level , after watching ur vdo i just put  AirPods pro in my ears and it‚Äôs game changed , I don‚Äôt think i should upgrade to pro 2 bcoz mines has the same has 2,"

2023-03-28,She's Lucifer's Chloe But With More Life
2023-03-28,I‚Äôm so buying these and will ask my husband if he wants my old ones since he doesn‚Äôt like spending $$$
2023-03-28,Is this a review or an Apple keynote?
2023-03-28,So do they fit..not sure if you ever said?.
2023-03-28,"I wanted to buy this until I've realized that there is no MultiPoint so you can connect it to only one device at a time :( Not very ""Pro"""
2023-03-28,A pair or 10$ Headphones i bought 15 years ago offered all the sizes for the ear. Airpods did not ?
2023-03-28,Now the old ones sound tinny.
2023-03-28,"Jesus‚Ä¶.. so much excitement for trivial stuff! ‚ÄúLanyard look, OMG love it!!‚Äù *puts case on Apple Watch charger ‚ÄúOMG look at that, so fast!!‚Äù

2023-03-28,"Justine be like: ""All Apple products are life changing!"""
2023-03-28,I had these for a while now and honestly I'm disappointed.. thr noise canceling isn't amazing.. it doesn't cancel much noise that isn't a lower frequency or hum...
2023-03-28,That lanyard loop seems like such a throwback to the old iPod touch days a decade ago where they had that pop out circular lanyard loop. Anyone else remember those on the colored models? They were all the rage at my high school in the late 2000‚Äôs
2023-03-28,Apple should hire her as product manager.
2023-03-28,LIFE CHANGING!!!
2023-03-28,Was anyone ever able to FIND MY airpods before?  Offically?  On record?
2023-03-28,I can hear cars while walking. Are my air pods pro  broken. Noise cancellation is on
2023-03-28,anyone know if you can use the new XS ear tips with the gen 1 pro's?
2023-03-28,Love from India Ô∏è
2023-03-28,I‚Äôm a cyclist and I would never wear these when riding my bike. I need to be aware of my surroundings. I ride in a concrete riverbed when I come on joggers wearing AirPods they never hear me approaching!  I‚Äôm always having to avoid them. They have no idea that I am there!  Now if joggers are going to wear the AirPods at least run with the cyclists coming at you. That way you can see them coming and get out of the way. Some cyclists can travel at speeds up to 25 miles an hour and have no mercy for joggers. So please be careful!
2023-03-28,Great product except YouTube can‚Äôt play videos if you use them :)
2023-03-28,Most earphones don‚Äôt fit in my ears so I‚Äôm wondering if these will.
2023-03-28,"How do these AirPods do with phone calls ,"
2023-03-28,"Minimum sallary in Poland is $495.
These buds are $315. It`s a luxury product."
2023-03-28,Life changing? That‚Äôs some statement.
2023-03-28,So how are they life changing again?
2023-03-28,Who's from Tiktok? Lets gooo!!
2023-03-28,Did she say AirPods 2 in the beginning?
2023-03-28,Can anyone explain what the custom amplifier is?
2023-03-28,I still use first gen
2023-03-28,Dam 7 million subs. Nice.
2023-03-28,"well I use a galaxy buds+,  so yeah"
2023-03-28,I really love Justine but I know that she would even buy dirt and absolutely love it if Apple sold it. Haha.
2023-03-28,That ultra watch looks huge on your tiny wrist
2023-03-28,"I'm happier with my new AirPods pro (upgraded from 1st gen) than my new iPhone 14 pro (upgraded from 11 pro).
Actually somewhat disappointed with the new 14 pro and its horrible battery life."
2023-03-28,Does anyone know how to check a play count on a song on apple music?
2023-03-28,Why do we scan our ears for spacial audio when it‚Äôs an in ear headphone
2023-03-28,"This is why you should stick to phones for a long time too before upgrading. So that when you finally buy a new phone, you actually notice the difference instead of not seeing much difference if you upgrade year after year or two years even. I think 3 years should be a minimum upgrade time with maximum being up to you, probably 5-6 years. I have had my iPhone X for 5 years now when it hits November but I don't plan on buying the 14 Pro because I don't see a significant difference between that and the 13 Pro even though I don't have a 13. But waiting for the 15 should have some major pros, like there are big rumours it'll finally have USB type C and also a new design. Hopefully a periscope lens. I'll be happy so see the same style three cameras at the back going away after 4 years of staying there. The sim card tray possibly going away in UK models too could be a big con, I hope they keep it. Two major factors for me upgrading to iPhone 15 is if it has a periscope lens and USB type C. Also, I'll be disappointed if the periscope lens is only 5x and that the 10x comes a couple of years later. I'm expecting it tbh but I'll be disappointed if that is what actually ends up happening, even though the 10x has been out since like 2019 or 2020 so by the time it's 2023 September, it'll have been in development for four years. That's more than enough time to add a 10x zoom in the iPhone 

Funny how this video is about the airpods Pro 2 and I'm talking about iPhone. Mainly did that because of her reaction and how everyone else could react like that if they don't upgrade their phones all the time. 3 or more years and you'll actually notice some changes. However, I won't be getting the airpods Pro 2 mainly because it still looks the same and the colour is the same too. Don't wanna buy something where everyone will still think it's airpods Pro and not the new ones. Who knows when the third gen pros will release. Maybe in another three years but hopefully it's only 2 years this time. The airpods max hasn't done well because of the very big price tag. Lower the price tag by at least 150-200 and design it better and you'll see a massive difference in sales. The design was horrible, especially that bra case"
2023-03-28,Ijustine is bias about apple products
2023-03-28,Bro Ik where u were walking at (not to be creepy) I always go on walks at playa vista
2023-03-28,Apple makes the best products on the planet!!!!

2023-03-28,"Bose quiet comfort 2 is far better than apple in terms of ANC, Base, and overall sound"
2023-03-28,I feel like they made the Extra Small ear tips for children that need hearing aids lmao.
2023-03-28,Will buy it.
2023-03-28,I have all the AirPod but the AirPods max
2023-03-28,"I must say, Apple sure knows how to make money  to get a black lanyard, you‚Äôll need to get the sport case as the lanyard is only sold in one color, but the sport case has green edges‚Ä¶ so I‚Äôll need to get another entirely black case"
2023-03-28,What is your favorite AirPods case?
2023-03-28,Watching this video with my AirPods Pro 2
2023-03-28,You are the best
2023-03-28,does she work for apple? it's hard to tell.
2023-03-28,Would buy these Airpods pro 2 if she comes with the box...now that's Life Changing
2023-03-28,Pixel Buds Pro 2.  Serious contender for best in class as well.  This said earphones are not life changing.  They're earphones.
2024-10-28,Didn‚Äôt test the mic?

2023-03-28,"""you can now use the Extra small version ... me using the bigger one"
2023-03-28,It should be *Spatial Audio. Not spacial audio.
2023-03-28,Why Bluetooth but not AirPlay? :)
2023-03-28,"The 1st gen pros earpieces had a softer, more high-quality, texture! 
Day 1 using them = disappointed!"
2024-03-27,Hows the bass on this?
2023-03-28,Air pods max upgrade next
2023-03-28,Jesus that Apple Watch is gigantic
2023-03-28,Wooo ahhhh wtf same white box
2024-03-27,I bet she has her own Apple Store in her house
2023-03-28,AS SOON AS APPLE CREATES CELLULAR AIRPODS THEY COULD RELEASE AN AIRPODS CHARGING CASE WITH A PROJECTOR BUILT INTO IT.
2023-03-28,I am waiting for Arun‚Äôs review. Cannot trust her
2023-03-28,I like the idea of wireless ear buds but I'd probably lose one without even opening the box...hahah...great story of the apple ear buds. Thanks

2023-03-28,"if you think a pair of AirPods are ""life changing"" you dont have much of one !"
2023-03-28,Someone probably noticed it already but ‚Äúcompatability‚Äù for Apple Watch charger is not the right spelling
2023-03-28,"The drivers have not been improved. What you are hearing is software based. Apple throws a bunch of stuff out, nothing is new but software. Same with iPhone 14. I‚Äôm an audio engineer"
2023-03-28,Rinse & repeat

2023-03-28,i trust your review. airpods 3 didnt fit...i hope at last can have a good fit:)
2023-03-28,Do any of y‚Äôall know why we are not getting another iPad?
2023-03-28,Extra small ear tips size is game changing? Seriously?
2023-03-28,I will never get the pro because I don't like them with ear tip cushions It doesn't feel comfortable to me I love my AirPods  It fits perfectly in my ear It stays in my ear perfectly and when I wear it I feel like nothing's even there Apple is the literally the only company that designs it that way!
2023-03-28,"Babe, I love you but can you please stop blowing shit out of proportion!?"
2023-03-28,Which watch face is that?
2023-03-28,"Silicone earhooks, that's the way."
2023-03-28,Probably not good for me.  The Ls on the first gen Pros are barely big enough.

2023-03-28,"Life changing? Come on. I‚Äôve just bought the new AirPods Pro 2 and they are in fact a solid upgrade, far away from ‚Äúlife changing‚Äù."
2023-03-28,"I get that a Youtuber wants to attracts viewers, but I wish she would tone down the hyperbolic headlines."
2023-03-28,"What, I didnt know Justine had a tattoo on her finger."

2023-03-28,"I just got these delivered today after loosing my old AirPods on a cruise a few months ago (so ‚Äúfind my‚Äù didn‚Äôt work). I‚Äôm so excited to try them out. I was lucky with my ears that they did fit but TMI but I know I‚Äôm not the only one: A medication I am on causes excess earwax so I go through tips. It‚Äôs an embarrassing subject but if anyone suffers from this, using olive oil ear drops before and after usage really helps. Hope that helps someone out there"
2023-03-28,"Hahahaa Justine is very beautiful however she is very keen! And could sell Apple there own IPhone  but we all know that somebody gets paid  
And it‚Äôs not me"
2023-03-28,"Erm a baby is life changing, headphones? Not so"
2023-03-28,"I love you, but you got to stop saying ""this is a game changer"" about the smallest changes that could have been done."
2023-03-28,"yay new overprice stuff with bad stuff.. is the life changings, you stopping lisning to music because it sux ?"
2023-03-28,They need to work on fixing the issue for people who are allergic to them now  why can they not use a universal product. These are the first headphones I‚Äôve had this issue with
2023-03-28,How is any of this game changing?
2023-03-28,"If you want to see an actual review of an apple product, don't watch this channel. If you just want to see the positive side of apple products, then surely subscribe to this channel"
2023-03-28,Why do you act like you are surprised although it's obvious that the case is compatible with an Apple watch charger but you act like.... Ohhhhhhhhhh it works with this too... Like you discovered... Just think about yourself and try to realise what your life will be when you are old.... Apple fangirl who indulge in one and only company's products
2023-03-28,"@3:50. 
Justine ! Spatial not Spacial . 

Hehe, no offence. Big fan !"
2023-03-28,"Life changing? Like come on, they‚Äôre Bluetooth headphones"
2023-03-28,"Never mind AirPods, my grandfather who‚Äôs working in forest his whole life has small and beautiful hands compared to her.."
2023-03-28,Ihave my aripods 1 am satisfad  with then
2023-03-28,Ylvis are kings
2023-03-28,"Ya this is too biased for my liking. I wanna know pros and cons, not just how they're the best thing ever."
2023-03-28,Life changing....
2023-03-28,Apple pays her or else using word ‚ÄúLife changing‚Äù makes me feel bad for her life
2023-03-28,Jake's Bday!
2023-03-28,"next time someone keep a ""game changing"" count for her"
2023-03-28,8:04 eJustine???!!!
2023-03-28,You inspired to buy this
2023-03-28,How can it changed peoples lives?
2023-03-28,This is basically free advertising for Apple. How did this get so far?
2023-03-28,Spacial?
2023-03-28,"I get that they‚Äôre good, but‚Ä¶ ‚Äúlife changing‚Äù?"
2023-03-28,I‚Äôm sorry but i bought the #20 knockoffs called pro buds. Call me cheap.
2023-03-28,They‚Äôre so good at cutting out the sound of my bum farting out sloppy morning poos they changed my life too but they didn‚Äôt change my sense of smell unfortunately
2023-03-28,The Airpods are convenient but not life changing.  The Noble Fokus Pros are life changing.  I love Apple products but if sound quality is an important consideration then Noble blows Apple out of the water. Period.
2023-03-28,"This fool really put ‚Äúlife-changing‚Äù in the title as if it‚Äôs saving lives, or making you residual income that let‚Äôs you retire young‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
2023-03-28,"First of all I could say Apple has done themselves again as I could say a beep that you could find a missing airpod but yes I am still old school and yet I hope Sony snd other competitors will follow, one thing I want Apple to do is to have a detection where your AirPod is missing and that way to also have a free replacement when you lose one; after all Justine I am happy with Sony's headphones or to say the ear plugs from Sony that are as good as Apple or better. 

As to say I will say how are you doing? 

I hope you could expand your book about your blood clot story, and yet I notice is kind of odd as to say all your adventures throughout your life I still feel that I want someone in my life a significant other or I would say that I like you but actually I love you Justine as their is your inner beauty shines and yet their is my heart. 

I think of seeing myself on the TV on stage Terry Crews promiting me and you and yet I could imagine dancing and yet win AGT Justine your very beautiful, besides I would like to see you review other items and suggestions, yet I want to try to do a Porky Pig voice for AT&T and you going towards Porky Pig for an iPhone in a commercial for the Super Bowl. 

Yet I get to say I am going to do another Product That Rock video and yet I want to do a video about the Oura ring if I could sleep like a rock as after all I miss my dog Gypsy and yet I love Matt as Matt reminds me of Gypsy, but I could imagine myself with Gypsy again but with my own children playing with the dog, and having a family of my own I am ready to find someone to bare my own children but I want to be ready financially to have my own children because I want to make it big on YouTube on Embargoman. 

The video I am going to do on Products That Rock will be a personal care products video it is not an electric razor but is a product for shaving. 

In a way Matt reminds me of Gypsy and I love you Justine ever since your book I want to meet you and besides you are a very nice person you have both a beautiful body and a beautiful personality and you have a beautiful soul, you are all in one and yet people like you are very hard to find nowadays! 

Justine I love your videos and yet I could say this you are awesome! 

Their is one thing to say to you! 

When I choose someone I will be loyal only to one person to one woman to say this I am proud to be a one girl guy, yet don't let others see you for only one thing because men who see you for the wrong reasons they are not worth it, because you are very unique and your beauty is full. 

I will say I love  you with all of my heart! Ô∏è

Miguel"
2023-03-28,I have the AirPods Pro
2023-03-28,"They‚Äôre life changing! For a week‚Ä¶

2023-03-28,She just lives apple products. Bring her the first iPhone and she will just ooohhhh this is so beautiful and blablabla
2023-03-28,This is capitalism at its best. No materialistic things should be life changing. Is this really the only title you could come up with for a disposable apple product?
2023-03-28,So Beautiful
2023-03-28,3D Scan
2024-03-27,What‚Äôs life changing?   Lmao. That‚Äôs the most ridiculous title ever.  lol.

2023-03-28,Life changing ... ROFLMAO
2023-03-28,But they‚Äôre still ugly & bulky! Ô∏è why are they struggling to move away from the design. Most consumers are now after invisible ear phones

2023-03-28,

2023-03-28,"Life changing? Ma‚Äôam, you are abusing hyperbole. Settle down. The only way these could change your life is if you swallowed them. I do appreciate that you went into more detail about the specs and features rather than just gushing about them. Overall, good video. Thumbs up."

The power of money, marketing, and influence people are after.  In the end the MILLIONAIRE, doesn't care about you, it's not her job, her job is to market Apple.  Life changing Airpods huh?!?!  Did they make a deaf person hear for the 1st time or......are they just earbuds with features like the 100s on the market, but these ones here, these ones, THEY WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE.
