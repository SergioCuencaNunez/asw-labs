2024-03-27,A few months back I finally switched to a MacBook after years of using PC. I purchased a MacBook with M2 chip. I’m so glad I made the change. My video editing has been an absolute pleasure now. I can’t believe how long I invested in PC and still had issues. My MacBook Pro has the M2 chip and it’s so fast. I could only imagine how powerful the M3 chip is. I wouldn’t be upgrading because my MacBook Pro is getting the job done but wanted to share my experience.
2024-03-27,“That’s about a bread stick sized size difference.”  Love it.
2024-03-27,I love your unboxing videos bc you more than anyone else out there shows just how much it’s like adult Christmas every time you open a new apple product I am rocking the M1 rose gold MacBook Air.They need to bring pink to the new Mac book lineup!
2024-03-27,"I have been looking into selling my iPad to get a refurbished MacBook so i searched for MacBook and iMac reviews on YT and Ijustine popped up and I havent stopped watching. I can’t afford a MacBook nor a IMac now, but manifesting very soon. . Purple M3 24” IMac and 14” space grey MacBook. Amen"
2024-03-27,"Everyone: Deep dive into the specs, performance, productivity, benchmarks, cost/benefit etc
iJustine: Uhhh Look at the new beautiful colors and shapes, totally worth the money!"
2024-09-28,5:02 the crazy part is there is literally the equivalent to the price of a cars down payment casually sitting on the table right now
2024-03-27,That was fun to watch. I always prefer lighter colors like classic silver. Starlight looks beautiful as well. Spacegrey is good. Black would be too dark for me. And hey.. did you see how good she handles the knife?
2024-03-27,the thumbnail called me poor and unprivileged in negative zero seconds lmao
2024-03-27,You're such a great role model. I can't appreciate you enough! Always excited to see you share your enthusiasm.
2024-03-27,I've always had silver MBPs but I gotta admit that the Space Black one is stunning
2024-03-27,THE NEW COLORS LOOK GOOD!
2024-03-27,4:26 this one’s so old it has a light up logo….me sliding my MacBook Pro 15 under my desk
2024-03-27,All hail the queen of apple
2024-03-27,Thank you for always uploading quality content. Love you Justine.
2024-03-27,Sorry about your loss Mrs.iJustine.What a beautiful video Mrs.iJustine.Have a good one.
2024-03-27,I just got my brand new M3 MacBook Pro today and I LOVE it! I had a 2020 Intel MacBook Pro and it is night and day between the two!
2024-03-27,If you’re planning to switch from pc to . Trust me its 110% worth the money and best decision. I bought the pro m3 and no lie im enjoying it. Everything loads fast and quick. Long term laptop
2024-03-27,I absolutely love the Space Gray color on my MBP. Can't wait to see what the Space Black looks like in person.  The bigger question for Apple is... Where are the USB-C Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse? I want to get rid of Lightning on everything.
2024-03-27,"3:49 Americans will use
anything but the metric system!"
2024-03-27,i wanna buy this for myself for christmas since i have an intel chip but i dont think my parents will let me  it looks so cool though!
2024-03-27,They're such a good model. Machines so sweet I can't wait for this space black so excited recording
2024-03-27,"I am just wondering what you do with all the “old” Mac’s? Are they going to family, friends, donate or storage? Love to see if you can give us an update about that? And it is funny that you didn’t bought the MacBook Air in Midnight blue?"
2024-03-27,It's pretty sad when the most exciting thing about a new generation is the color lol.
2024-03-27,her comparing the size difference to an olive garden breadstick was SOOO american lmao i love her
2024-03-27,First video of yours that I've seen.  You have all the Apple accessories as well as all those MacBooks.  I was worried you'd scratch your new M3 Max with that ring!
2024-03-27,Midnight is the best color...
2024-08-29,"typing this from my maxed out m3 max! not a single regret, this machine is insane (I am a filmmaker/vfx artist). And you really said it right, at this point you just know you need it or you're slowly going throw frame by frame hell"
2024-03-27,The Blue is my favorite and I ordered a Space Black M3 Max for work.
2024-03-27,THAT'S ABOUT A BREAD STICK SIZE DIFFERENCE!
2024-03-27,Can’t wait to upgrade! Still using my early 2015 MacBook Pro.
2024-03-27,"Gigachad, with Apple since many years ago and never switched to other brands! I respect you!"
2024-03-27,"Shining, shimmering, splendid!"
2024-03-27,"I thought I wanted a 16”, but wow that seems huge."
2024-03-27,Size differences measured in bread sticks would actually be a scientific progress for Americans. ;-)
2024-03-27,girl has 6 MacBooks over here and I'm still trying to get one i love iJustine she's just such a mood
2024-03-27,"that color actually is very common to other laptops, the specs is what im impressed not the color.. Hopefully Someday I can afford that now I cant.. im not rich like Justine"
2024-03-27,Great Stuff! As always!
2024-03-27,YES! M3 Max Macbook Pro! Fire!
2024-05-01,I’m thinking of making the M3 max pro my first ever apple laptop. I’ve always had windows and I have an ASUS ROG Strix and it’s served me pretty well this past seven years. But I think I’m ready for an upgrade soon.
2024-03-27,You should turn that MacBook mosaic into a wallpaper.
2024-03-27,I love this colour mac table!!
2024-03-27,"2:26 wait for it, wait for it . . . Booom! The iDrop on iJustine can pull off!"
2024-03-27,This is the model I’m getting ️
2024-03-27,I’m upgrading to the 2023 16-inch M3 Max model from the 2017 15-inch 7th gen i7
2024-03-27,"""Thank you for sending me the not-yet-one-year-old space grey MBP, I will finally get to experience using a Mac."", says me in my dream."
2024-03-27,"Yo, I love the color. That space black design is sick!"
2024-03-27,"I love my 14"" space gray m1 mbp. Don’t think I’ll need to change it at least for 2 more years"
2024-03-27,Watching this on the M3 Pro model right now!
2024-03-27,When ijustine has a family meeting
2024-03-27,If you opt for the 14” instead of 16” you’ll have an extra space to carry your lunch in your backpack. Is that what it meant?
2024-03-27,"""So THOUGHTFUL... "" @ 2:32  Exactly.... Justine.....Exactly."
2024-03-27,HEYY APPLE  LOOK AT THIS VIDEO AND THAT LADY GIVE HER GOLDEN CUSTOMER CARD
2024-03-27,"Olive Garden breadstick width. Take that, rest of the world!"
2024-03-27,"I think the fact you’ve gone from a fully specked Mac Pro Intel computer, to a 14” Laptop is a testament to how good Apples silicon is!"
2024-03-27,"Space Black would be my favorite, I'd like to check them out in person."
2024-03-27,"When is apple coming out with a true gaming mac book, with these new chips?"
2024-03-27,Justine do you put a case on your MacBook if so which one would love to see a video on that
2024-03-27,"Justine, thanks! This is EXACTLY what we want to see above all as an unboxing video: Your PERSONAL MacBook Pro! 

Now the hype is REAL!"
2024-03-27,Man I love the new black but im afraid it will just further kill space grey. Im hoping to god we get an iMac or new Studio display in space grey
2024-03-27,I have the 2022 macbook air in 13 inch and midnight colour and i love itt!!
2024-03-27,Most people watching this don't have a Macbook.
2024-03-27,I am still rocking the old school MacBook Pro 2015. But I do think it is time now.
2024-03-27,Justine will have her M3 maxed out before the M4 arrives
2024-03-27,All those macs together looked like a game of Tetris lol!
2024-03-27,Silver is just timeless <3

2024-03-27,ijustine is the best
2024-03-27,"Love the colour comparisons side by side, I think I prefer the blue still, close second the space black."
2024-03-27,"If Darth Vader had a laptop it would definitely be this one, it's so black like his heart haha!"
2024-03-27,"Im planning on getting a max pro. I nromally use PC and I still have some software that is PC only. However i look forward to doing some Red video editing, smaller 3D modeling, some game dev, paper work etc when I need time away from my PC workstation"
2024-03-27,Love ur videos
2024-03-27,"They should make the MacBook lineup like the iMac, come in more colors like they had back in the day."
2024-03-27,I love that new Maxed out M3 Max MacBook Pro
2024-03-27,"Do yall think their 18GB unified and 512GB is enough for things like coding? Planning on using this for the rest of my college years, and hopefully more lol. This would be my first Apple laptop, so I’m not sure what 18GB is even equivalent to for windows!"
2024-03-27,"Justine, what do you do with your old macbooks once you upgrade to the latest maxed out model? Just curious since you upgrade so often.
edit: nevermind... I watched the video and apparently you keep them all lol"
2024-03-27,am i the only one who likes the space grey better?? i wish apple kept it for the pro chips
2024-03-27,I wish they brought back the glowing logo it would look so good on the black MacBooks
2024-03-27,Justine energy is out of the world
2024-03-27,"Caught the ""A whole new world"" lyrics. :)"
2024-03-27,They need to come back with gold
2024-03-27,"I hope one day they make the MacBook Pros in many different colors like the iMac, or even like the pro iPhones. Then we could tell which year a MacBook Pro is from just by the color! Wish they could do that for the Mac mini too, but I know they never will. I will always hold out hope for a brown or green or purple MacBook Pro"
2024-03-27,"midnight would be the best for if it was not for the finger prints, I therefore will go with space black."
2024-03-27,Thats a nice tv on you’re wrist
2024-03-27,I need that blue one!
2024-03-27,"OMG Your jacket looked pink, that light is weird."

2024-03-27,"So what will you do with the older or newer AirPods if you do get them back? Keep them as a second pair, give them away or return the new pair?"
2024-03-27,You know it’s bad when I’m the one saying that’s too many MacBooks lol. I may have many different models of especially iPhones but I don’t like having two of the same lol.
2024-03-27,I love the bread  measurements.  now I have a specific size in my mind

2024-03-27,"The problem is not the maxed out one, the problem is the 1800,- Euro ""entry"" version that comes with a whopping 8 Gigs of RAM. If you want more, 8 GB more is only 250,- Euros - what a bargain."

2024-03-27,"Space grey is my fav, and with the new M3 Pro it doesn’t have space grey!  What do I do?  lol"
2024-03-27,"So annoyed that Apple is mostly sending out the Max chip when most people aren’t going to drop $4,000-$7,000 on a laptop. The information is useless and definitely gives a vibe that they have something to hide with the machines that most people can actually afford."
2024-03-27,Can I please get the other one when he returns it..
2024-03-27,"I love your videos, they are always what I am looking for! Have anyone tried putting a case on your Mac? Everyone is using the cases now, and I'm wondering if I should buy it or it's not that good for your Mac. I'm thinking of buying it from BURGA"
