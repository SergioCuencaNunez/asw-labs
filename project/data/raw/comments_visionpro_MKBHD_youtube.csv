2024-03-29,Taking off a VR headset reminds me of taking off ski boots. You appreciate being back to walking normal again but you really enjoyed the time on the hill.
2024-03-29,I always thought this is what google glass was supposed to be. Years later we got these huge snow goggles.
2024-03-29,Marques is the only person who actually looks cool wearing this thing
2025-01-28,"Early today Apple Vision Pro, and WOW  It‚Äôs more than a VR headset it‚Äôs like stepping into the future! Immersive, seamless, and mind-blowing. You can‚Äôt wait to go back once you‚Äôve experienced it. Apple has truly outdone itself again!"
2024-03-29,"I‚Äôm excited to see our personas in a few years‚Ä¶ full body teleportation, sign me up"
2024-03-29,The Vision Pro's hand gestures always make me think of the scene with Tony Stark messing around in that 3D space
2024-03-29,I honestly just can't wait to see this in the next 5-10 years and see the market grow and competitors try to 1UP each other
2024-03-29,"Love the honesty on ‚Äúshould I get this‚Äù?  No.  Even after watching all these videos, these headsets still feel like a novelty rather than tech you‚Äôll reach for to use in two months."
2024-03-29,"""Absolutely amazing, unparalleled, best I've ever seen"" - quote going in Tim Cook's next keynote."
2024-03-29,8:34 you're telling me I can stare at the sun with these?? FINALLY!!!!
2024-03-29,We will all be wearing advanced versions of this in 10 years without a doubt.
2024-03-29,11:03 Nice to see that Cleo came over to try the Vision Pro
2024-03-29,"""I'm limited by the technology of my time"" - Howard Stark (Iron Man 2)

Excited how this product progresses in the future."
2024-03-29,The fact that you looked up at the wall where you thought a window would be without the headset on is the best evidence I've heard yet that this thing will stick.
2024-03-29,"Like the 1st generation iPhone, the 1st gen Vision Pro is the answer to questions we haven't yet thought of. 
I agree with Marques: time will tell."
2024-03-29,That little story he tells at 12:57 about forgetting he didn‚Äôt have the headset on is actually CRAZY when you think about it. Imagine what the tech will be like in 5 years
2024-03-29,"13:11 Dont worry, we all do this to some extent. This reminds me of hearing stories of astronauts when the first come home, and break objects on the floor (like. Mug or plate) because they were expecting those objects to stay floating where they leave them. It‚Äôs amazing how fast our brains recalibrate!"
2024-03-29,"Fun fact... ""Foveated Rendering"" was also used in the Royal Air Force's Harrier GR3 Flight Simulator back in the late 1980s, the pilot wore a special helmet that tracked the movement of the eyes so that the projection on to the screen only had to render in detail where the pilot was looking as of course back then computing power, especially for video rendering, was extremely limited."
2024-03-29,"I don‚Äôt plan on buying this but I was curious about your review and appreciate so much how honest, realistic, and relatable you are. You are the best tech reviewer of the internet and I thank you for helping us understand the newest things coming to the market"
2024-03-29,Watching this on my quest 3
2024-03-29,15:01 VR YUGIOH AND POKEMON GONNA BE WILD
2024-03-29,"I have seen most of the reviews. This is hands down the ""smartest"" tech review of the Apple Vision Pro, with the most accurate questions to ask. MKBHD has almost 20 Million subs for a reason.."
2024-03-29,"12:30 - this will also a huge innovation for people who need a big screen in the field to work on things (construction, planning, etc.). As a battery powered autark working unit there are so many things possible now."
2024-03-29,"Bruh. Imagine using this as an Italian‚Ä¶
You meet your friend and speak like this ü´¥ and the next thing you find out is that the Vision Pro opened a thousand tabs, ordered pizza and the next Uber ride to the Colosseum"
2024-03-29,12:56 You are not alone!! I usually press the non existent side button in my office mouse from the habit of using my own mouse at home
2024-03-29,It's funny that when we were young our parents didn't let us get too close to the TV and now people strap a TV to their eye balls.
2024-03-29,This is probably the best use case I've seen for transparent oled in the future. That is clearly the technology this was built for. Put the computer on the back of the head or in the battery enclosure and send video feed to a thin transparent display on the front.
2024-03-29,"During the ecosystem section 12:31, i think one of the things that can be done to mitigate having to look at objects while using the virtual display for the Mac, is for there to be a ""turn off eye tracking"" option.
Since all the controls (Keyboard and mouse) still works, being able to turn off eye tracking while working in passthrough mode should be an option for the user."
2024-03-29,Google Glass (2013) made me think we would have this technology in a much smaller form factor by now
2024-03-29,"I remember when the iPhone apps of the lighter, the beer glass, and silly apps were the shit. I‚Äôm sure eventually the apps for Vision Pro will grow and become something we can‚Äôt even imagine at the moment."
2024-03-29,FINALLY a review that talks about the field of view. Every other video out there implies that the view of the Vision Pro is the same as the view without wearing it
2024-03-29,"I returned mine after a couple of days. The price was simply too much, especially when it‚Äôs only function is for hobbyists. If you want to get into VR, go with meta or any of the other competitors. Based on price and quality, it makes zero sense to own one of these"
2024-03-29,Imagine being in the middle of an F1 pit stop while watching all the live stats and racing action
2024-03-29,"No, I won't buy one, BUT...  It looks to be a fantastic update on tech!!  I've been watching your videos for years and have always enjoyed them for their clarity, honesty ...and less noise.  I was there for your first 1M subscribers' video live stream. 
Anyway, this one on the Vision Pro did not disappoint.  I've watched all three videos on the Vision Pro and enjoyed each one.  You've set and continue a high standard for review research.  98% of the products you review I will never use, much less buy.  But keep it up; we enjoy your presentation of the information."
2024-03-29,"The looking for a window thing reminds me of when I have used my iPad too much, and suddenly sit down on a Mac trying to touch the screen.. only to realize it does not have touch"
2024-03-29,"The way Marques Says ''It's the Best iv seen'' (with Todays Tech) Makes me feel you seen something better maybeeeee from the Future lol 
also Courtside Games and things like that Will 100 % be available they will want to do deals with the leagues for subscriptions or virtual tickets i heard they will do this for concerts too 
Thanks for the Info Marques"
2024-03-29,"i remember being a kid trying to learn how to track objects in place as a video editing effect and now just seeing this thing do it instantaneously and effortlessly is wild

(Edit: Woah that‚Äôs a lot of likes)"
2024-03-29,"It‚Äôs so great how all the YouTubers were referencing MKB‚Äôs review video on their own videos, lol"
2024-03-29,"14:30 the section about concepts for how the vision pro could be used

If Niantic did a genuine collab with them and had a special version of Pokemon Go where instead of using the games interface to see the wild Pokemon nearby they would just. Overlay the Pokemon in your vicinity like actual wild Pokemon. Many years down the line when something like this could become mainstream we can finally experience Pokemon Go like they showed in the original commercials

Even the conveying of the scale of Pokemon could be done so well using this style of device.

(Sorry I just want an immersive Pokemon experience)"
2024-03-29,"""Today's technology hasn't caught up to what they are trying to do here"" sounds like a reeeeeally nice way to say this thing isn't worth it. Like, the metaverse was a vision that today's tech hasn't caught up to... because it is a bad idea that misunderstands what we want from technology."
2024-03-29,"Man @Marquess I can‚Äôt tell how much we, the 90% of the world, that doesn‚Äôt understand inches, pounds and Fahrenheit, appreciate you showing the weight and in grams!"
2024-03-29,If they made a Vision non Pro that had the only function of mirroring your Mac's display I'd be so sold
2024-03-29,"The YouTube effect was done flawlessly, it really made me feel the FOV"
2024-03-29,Everybody looks like Will Smith in Shark Tale hahahaha!
2024-03-29,I love how every loading screen feels like getting a drink from an old-timey soda fountain
2024-03-29,"I never thought about how VR/AR can transform sports viewing, wow!"
2024-03-29,"OK, when you go outside and demonstrate the windows in space‚Ä¶ Outside!, It‚Äôs just fantastic. Wow."
2024-03-29,"ok guys idk if its a coincidence or something, im watching mr robot again and in s2 ep4 at 13:01 in the train a girl is wearing apple vision pro, and that episode was released in july 27 2016..."
2024-03-29,4:47 Was totally wondering why it looked soooo blurry watching this! Makes total sense and can see where you were looking if you pause.
2024-03-29,That voice over at 0:24 was seamless. Wow!
2024-03-29,"Being an f1 fan, the concept video of having the track in your environment, seeing the position of the drivers, extra battles, alone would make me spend the money on it."
2024-03-29,Dear headset makers: I just want a helmet
2024-03-29,15:52 Not having TikTok on this thing may be the biggest selling point honestly...
2024-03-29,Imagine having to watch a YouTube ad on the Vision Pro‚Ä¶ New frustration level unlocked.
2024-03-29,"The ""Pro"" in the name is just there to justify the pricing for the average Apple consumer. It's just marketing."
2024-03-29,"10:55 
the best way I could describe what it looks like is when they do the inside helmet cam view from Iron man"
2024-03-29,"What I love about your videos, besides the polish and the overall quality, is just that you look like you‚Äôre actually having fun doing what you do. I appreciate that. Headset looks cool, I guess."
2024-03-29,"0:22 That transition was smooth, the fact you couldn't notice the mic transition"
2024-03-29,"""Trying new stuff in a way only Apple would."" just ignore Oculus, HTC and Valve revolutionizing the VR industry for years. They're just doing new stuff and making things better but Apple is doing NEW stuff and making things BETTER."
2024-03-29,"I just did a demo of it today at the Apple Store, and that's a memory I'll never forget."
2024-03-29,I wish they would have just abstracted the representation of the eyes on the outside to two dots that blink when you blink and track your gaze. It would have been a lot friendlier. Or at least make it an option to swap between Persona or a more cartoony abstraction as a theme.
2024-03-29,"Field of view is something you get used to. I recently started wearing glasses full time at age 48, and I got progressive lenses. It took a week or so, but I‚Äôm now totally used to turning my head more and not flicking my eyes to the side. I would guess this is a similar transition."
2024-03-29,Today's day dream...Tomorrow's nightmare.
2024-03-29,"The transition/sync at 0:23 to voice-over is butter smooth, nicely done"
2024-03-29,"Watching Marques get excited about the thought of these 'not yet actual' apps (F1, Court side, Vacuuming, etc) shows so much about how cool this tech will become. This guy is smart, and techy, not just some reviewer reading a script. He actually understands the technology and his ability to not only provide a great review, but his ability to see it's potential is exciting!"
2024-03-29,Marques gained the ability to speak without moving his lips at 0:23
2024-03-29,Phone addiction to the next level
2024-03-29,"That chess shot 9:04 is the most impressive thing ever, it hides your real hand!"
2024-03-29,"I've been watching this channel for so many years, and I just wanna say I appreciate all the hard work you've put in throughout all these years. Year after year, the video quality, the audio quality, the content, the research, and the overall production don't cease to improve and amaze me. You deserve everything you've earned from your work. Keep it up bro"
2024-03-29,"that F1 watching through vision pro idea is soooo great, it literally feels like how future would be like, love it"
2024-03-29,15:00 cool
2024-03-29,Need to see what it‚Äôs like working on a car with this. It would be insane if you can see overlays of your car parts while watching videos on how to do what you‚Äôre doing
2024-03-29,"I can not imagine apple keeping that front screen, as an engineer i cant picture justifying what must be $200+ in additional cost plus the cost, weight and liability of front glass for a feature that is basically just a meme and something very few people would consider a purchase driving force"
2024-03-29,In 2019 I bought an 8K TV assuming that the 8K content will come soon. Still waiting for it. The same will be with Apple Vision Pro
2024-03-29,"So in the future when moms will tell kids to not sit close to a screen, kids are going to put literal screens on their face lol"
2024-03-29,Wow the F1 race tracking idea looks cool AF!
2024-03-29,"Im not it in the market to buy one of these, but I enjoy learning about the technology. Props Marques."
2024-03-29,"the vacuuming app is for quest 3/pro, and it is a real tech-demo, not just a concept"
2024-03-29,Will check this video after 6 years in 2030 to see how much the technology will evolve over time.
2024-03-29,Heads up Marques.  The reason people are at odds with the FOV topic so much is that it drastically changes depending on the Light Seal size you‚Äôre given from your face scan.  Some Redditors that tried on different Light Seals at the Apple Store say the difference was super noticeable. Hence no solid numbers listed on the product page.
2024-03-29,"With the weight comparison, don‚Äôt forget that the Quest 3 and other headsets also have the battery ALSO in it. So if they would only use an external battery it would be a bigger difference"
2024-03-29,"I like how they give you one head strap to look cool in and a second, comfortable one, to actually use the thing with"
2024-03-29,"I hope they expand the social possibilities here to bring together long distance friends n family. Sitting in a coach together watching a movie, playing a game of chess with the person in front of you, etc. And I haven't even touched on the incredible opportunities this could have to make meetings feel more like a real life conversation!"
2024-03-29,"He does SUCH good reviews. Sensible, measured, informative."
2024-03-29,That 3D model of the race track is the coolest thing I have ever seen. Ever.
2024-03-29,The looking up at the corner of your vision thing reminds me of the rumbling in my pocket only to realize my phone is on the table.
2024-03-29,I love how honest you are all the time! That‚Äôs a huge deal!!!
2024-03-29,The Apple Newton (1992) was a product held back by the technology of its day. It took 15 years until such a device was successful with the release of the iPhone. The AVP is more like a Newton than an iPhone 1.
2024-03-29,"This kind of tech makes me wonder if we are already living in such a reality, our world is literally pixelated, its just the refresh rate and the pixel density being way higher than this. The fact that something like this can be combined with AI and quantum computing drives me nuts. Is it the END of the world or Creation of a new one, not sure! But its too soon.."
2024-03-29,"I love that Marques uploads super crispy HD video and then YouTube walks in like ‚ÄúMmm.. how about 720p?‚Äù 

EDIT: Yes I am on WiFi, my connection is stupid fast, and yes my quality is set to highest. I‚Äôm talking about YouTube throttling stream quality."
2024-03-29,unplugging the battery is not the only way to turn off the apple vision pro and you can press those two butttons on the top simultaneously to turn it off.
2024-03-29,"I had 4k to spend on a new apple vision bro I saved up for 6 months but after watching many reviews on the Vision Pro, I last minute used the money I saved and bought Apple stocks and decided to buy the AVP later for Christmas. Thank You for review."
2024-03-29,"Imagine running yt shorts, tiktok, and insta reels all at once lmao"
2024-03-29,"‚ÄúMarques should I get it?‚Äù ‚ÄúProbably not‚Äù. This is why Marques will always be my favourite, you know he‚Äôll always tell you truth!"
2024-03-29,"the comment about ""looking up for where you thought a window would be"" was scary and so fun at the same time. I don't know what to think"
2024-03-29,So good with words. Critiquing is an art and MBKHD is an artisit!
2024-03-29,"your new found emphasis on the background music didn't go unnoticed. excellent, btw."
2024-03-29,I‚Äôm so excited for the future of this industry!
2024-03-29,Bruh ya all forgetting the biggest thing Nintendo and apple can drop the biggest POK√âMON game in history now .
2024-03-29,9:03 waiting for the chess content creator reaction to this
2024-03-29,"When you showed the screen recording to demonstrate the sharpening with eye tracking‚Ä¶ it made me notice what you tend to look at, which made me realize advertisers are going to LOVE eye tracking data when they get their hands on it"
2024-03-29,Tech-neck to the millionth degree.
2024-03-29,This reminded me of what people were saying about Google Glass when they came out. The tech always seems to be a little behind but I‚Äôm glad people are still pushing the envelope and I can‚Äôt wait to see where this leads.
2024-03-29,"14:52
watching a football match  like that would be mad impressive‚Ä¶!!"
2024-03-29,I think the best thing the the Vision Pro brings to the market is that Meta can now focus all its energy to the affordable segment. We had a single company trying to cover the whole price spectrum.  Now competition will force the two players to focus on different segments and that's great for consumers. It's Android vs iOS all over again.
2024-03-29,Tried it in store today. Agreed with MKBHD. This product is compelling. I'm excited to see where it goes from here.
2024-03-29,"I will definitely wait for the next version. I feel like this is really a test version just to see what kind of applications it can be used for, and hopefully by that time the hardware will be a little bit smaller. I‚Äôm going to guess in three years."
2024-03-29,The production quality of these videos is insane. Great work.
2024-03-29,11:02 this is as dystopian as it gets
2024-03-29,"Apple very smart, they waited tax time to release this device"
2024-03-29,Audio editing at 0:22 is spotless
2024-03-29,Its crazy that the time between the outside cameras to the inside screens is about 1 milliseconds slower compared to our processing speed from eye to brain.
2024-03-29,Only you can pull off 3 consecutive review videos for the same product! Unparalleled honesty. Great job
2024-03-29,My thing as a consumer is... I don't blame Apple for not having those apps. It's not their app. I blame the developers. It's their fault and they should make an app for it
2024-03-29,The court-side and F1 concepts are so cool!! When more Apps as such are released I will definitely pick up VR.
2024-03-29,The social implications of devices like this (if the price ever reaches the level where mass-adoption is possible) would be an interesting discussion. Moving the screen in your hand to the screen in your vision seems like the next logical step. But what would that mean for society? Thanks for the review!
2024-03-29,The biggest issue I see with the device is multiple profiles. If I‚Äôm not using and one of my family member picks up the device they should login and have their apps and data. It‚Äôs closer to an Apple TV or Apple Pod where the family would share the device where a phone and watch are personal. I hope they add this in future versions else I can‚Äôt see me personally buying for a 1 person use.
2024-03-29,"Just tested it. I also tested the Pico 4 and quest 3. I'm sorry but I was wow testing the quest 3, but was very disappointed with the vision pro."
2024-03-29,This might be the most anticipated review in a while
2024-03-29,The video quality in your videos never ceases to amaze me! The shots of you talking in the white room has the highest image quality of any video I swear it always blows me away! Keep up the mind blowing production
2024-03-29,Apple has previously released a ‚Äúpro‚Äù product first: the first ever MacBook was the ‚ÄúMacBook Pro‚Äù (Jan 2006) followed later that year by the ‚ÄúMacBook‚Äù (May 2006)
2024-03-29,"How you keep on upping the quality and relevance on your video‚Äôs, is beyond me. Love your work"
2024-03-29,"I've said this in various places: hook AR goggles to sonar, let me see under water when boating, where the sea floor is, possibly where fish are. That's the killer app."
2024-03-29,"0:39 I was fully expecting Marcus to say ""And just as interesting as this individual product, is our sponsor"""
2024-03-29,Does it has a CALCULATOR??
2024-03-29,"Excellent review. I appreciate how the performance limitations are correlated to technological issues / development.
It would be nice if they allowed the VisionPro to register a keyboard so that you could ""see"" it even in total emersion."
2024-03-29,"Last year during cricket IPL in India. Jio did something that on paper was a great idea. They were selling this very cheap but good quality mobile VR headset, where you can use your phone to watch the IPL matches from their Jiocinema app in the VR from the VIP stands. While the idea was great, mobile screen in VR look like 144p so the video itself wasn't enjoyable, but the immersion of VR was actually really good you could look around you 360 degrees. Now if Apple manages to do something like that for basketball, football (European) and other sports imagine watching those matches on Vision Pro with 4k, 90hz."
2024-03-29,"I'm looking forward to version 3 or 4 of this tech because it'll most likely be smaller and more efficient. Would not be surprised if Apple's end goal would be to make it ""the future of iPhone"" with it being fully incorporated tech in a single device"
2024-03-29,Man I love watching this guys videos. Another great piece of content by MKBHD consumed.
2024-05-03,"The difference between the first smartphone and smartwatch taking off and this taking off is that you didnt have to pay $3500 for it, so the lack of features combined with the price tag is definitely a big deal breaker considering most people can already do all of this right now without the headset"
2024-03-29,"""There has to be something about this that people really like""

Yes: watching movies and playing video games in a big ass screen that shrinks and grows at will. That feature alone would make me buy one of these. I work with audio in a computer so it would be great for that too. 
I only hope the tech keeps evolving to be more affordable and less brand related"
2024-03-29,Okay‚Ä¶ you did it. I‚Äôm now genuinely excited. Not for this version. But definitely for the future. Gen 2 or 3 seems likely for me
2024-03-29,"The Vision Pro feels like a fresh breeze in terms of innovation and enhanced capabilities. The brilliant concept to make such a futuristic device has truly stood out. While there are certain areas for improvement, it is definitely an interesting gadget worth exploring."
2024-03-29,LMAO that scene transition at the end with the apple vision pro was next level
2024-03-29,"MKBHD‚Äôs ‚Äòendorsement‚Äô of Vision Pro has gotten me somewhat interested in getting one.  That is, after three of four generational updates."
2024-03-29,"It‚Äôs so funny that you mention the bands, and I‚Äôll admit that an hour is the longest I‚Äôve spent inside, but I genuinely prefer the Solo Knit Band. The Dual Loop is also very comfortable, but the ease of adjustment of the Solo Knit makes it the winner for me."
2024-03-29,"It doesn't look very glasses friendly... I sure do love being left behind because of my disability.
Also those personas are super creepy, RIGHT into the uncanny valley."
2024-03-29,Walking around with it made me think he‚Äôs a Black Eyed Peas member.
2024-03-29,"I think it was Marques who said this, but generally you shouldn‚Äôt buy a product hoping it will get better with software/updates. Buy it because you‚Äôre satisfied with what it has now, and everything else that comes will be extra. Seems befitting for the Vision Pro"
2024-03-29,By far one the must well thought out reviewsÔ∏è
2024-03-29,Bro out here looking like a bug rofl
2024-03-29,Oh when  Cartman had those goggles on and everybody could hear his thoughts/who he was communicating with. that‚Äôs what they were gettin at here ?
2024-03-29,"2 things Apple needs to improve on the next gen unit:

1) Remove the reticular display - it's just dead weight, extra cost, and wasted processing power & battery life on inside-out tracking.

2) Add option to enable moving pointer with hands/finger tracking; otherwise it'll cause eye fatigue and severely limit input speed/multitasking ability on the device"
2024-03-29,"This SCREAMS first gen, but I havent seen a first gen device like this that feels like such a gateway for the future, and how close it brings us to that."
2024-03-29,This product is going to be successful like iPhone.
2024-03-29,Lot's of the points and the idea of future technology reminds a lot the pros and cons of the google glass... Hopefully it will turn out a lot better this time around
2024-03-29,"As someone who‚Äôs into VR I can see this product being commonplace in the next 10-15 years, and will allow types of computing that haven‚Äôt even been thought of yet"
2024-03-29,Can't wait for the rest of the scuba gear to be reviewed.
2024-03-29,"Thank you for this demonstration. It was very well done. What I have been looking to see is how I can zoom in and out. I am legally blind and use the Zoom feature on my iMac and MacBook. I really would like to see if/how the Zoom feature can help me read text within the windows and also text on a wall in the room or signage such as the name on a store or the text on a street sign. Please consider demonstrating this feature if it exists on the Apple Vision Pro.

On iMac and MacBook, the Zoom feature I use can be turned on as follows:

Settings >> Accessibility >> Zoom >> Toggle On ""Use scroll gesture with modifier keys to zoom"" >> Leave ""Modifier key for scroll gesture"" set to the default ""Control"" key >> Set Zoom style to ""Full Screen"".

Obviously, if I could use this feature in the Apple Vision Pro, I could have full access to the environment around me. So please, if you could, I know for a fact there are thousands of people who would greatly appreciate the demonstration."
2024-03-29,"I think in retrospect, this will be a very historic moment for the tech industry. There is very high potential in moving from our 2d screens to the third dimension. It‚Äôs enables interfaces with vastly higher information density, without feeling cluttered like too packed 2d UI‚Äôs. Interactions will be more analogous to how things work in the real world and thus easier to learn. 
AR is the future and this is a phenomenal first step. Exciting times!"
2024-03-29,You can tell he was wearing the headset 0:45 the imprinting goes hard
2024-03-29,6:30 Apple are saving that for a spec bump ;)
2024-05-03,id rather have the meta quest pro + sansung s24 fold + 20Amp-Hour (not milliamp hour) battery
2024-03-29,"Marques, you actually can remove the battery cord, using a sim ejector tool into the tiny hole. Just thought I'd let you know."
2024-03-29,"Bro makes better ""ads"" than Apple themselves
EDIT: I put ad in quotation marks 'cause I didn't have a better word for it. What about opening animation/cinematic?"
2024-03-29,Holy cow! I just watched your full 24min video and you didn't break  my attention with an ad break or boaring nonsense tech. Bravo making a completely engaging video without have it only be interesting to tech nerds.
2024-03-29,You know you mean Iron Man
2024-03-29,Your content quality and the peace and comfort it brings to me is at another level.
2024-03-29,"Cool, Ima wait for the Vision Air"
2024-03-29,"Gotta say, after all this time, it's so cool to finally see a full legit headset review from you, with all the terminology and comprehension of FOV and weight distribution concerns, foveated rendering, etc.  l can't wait to see more."
2024-03-29,12:56  This is scarier than we think
2024-03-29,"I‚Äôm a traveler! Make an app for parks, guides, museums, city tours. Soooooo many things for us to do, see and interact with virtually!"
2024-03-29,Watching the Dakar race (like the f1 example) and being able to zoom at and seeing the whole course and racers would be sick
2024-03-29,"0:24 the transition between you speaking on camera and the voice over was beautiful, didn't even realize it at first!"
2024-03-29,Switch off too human mode
2024-03-29,"15:45 oh god, watching tiktok in VR is gonna be even worse for attention spans and doomscrolling"
2024-03-29,visionOS looks so clean as he navigates throughout all of this. I don‚Äôt know why all of the other reviews have poor screen capture and Marques‚Äô actually looks close to the marketing materials.
2024-03-29,I can't help but think the 2nd and 3rd Gen of these are going to be amazing.
2024-03-29,"My thumbs are burning from scrolling through videos, I think the vision pro can help with that!!!"
2024-03-29,"Love the Lupe Fiasco-type beat in the intro! & the cinematic look over the headset. Dang, Marques! Each video just gets better & better."
2024-03-29,"Do you guys remember the south park VR headset episode, yes that one... its a reality now. The Graphics suck!"
2024-03-29,"Only fully matured person will understand 

Apple vision is not a solution it is just a solution which is finding problems 

When I was kid I thought that technology will kill the following
1)Good memories 
2)Family time 
3) Reality
And this started to become real 
And this is just a first step"
2024-03-29,I‚Äôve hardly ever heard marques use the word LOVE for any tech‚Ä¶what a compliment for Apple.
2024-03-29,"""Looked where I though a window would be"" 13:05 without the head set on. Had to laugh at that because I do the same thing. I use the tab S7 for all of my notes so when I actually have a piece of paper and try to, without thinking, select the notes with the pen or zoom I look like an idiot but I'm just used to the more powerful tool."
2024-03-29,Will wait for the 3rd version
2024-11-29,Well that failed... That should be apple's motto
2024-03-29,When you say they tried to do AR but the technology isn't there yet... INMO Air is already doing it. What Apple is struggling with is to make a hybrid product that does both great AR and VR
2024-03-29,$3000 to just to look at a digital version of myself and watch YouTube on my wall?
2024-03-29,"The F1 Racing is super cool.

Imagine watching a war movie of like Roman Army‚Äôs clashing with thousands of other fighters.

Imagine seeing a layout of the battlefield down below in a macro level view while also seeing the first person action of the main actor on screen."
2024-03-29,"why isnt that no one is concerned about its affects on our society , like are we ready for this as humans. Like should we mention at least how life is going to be with this kind of Technologie opened for the public, social interactions , health issues , addiction , pronoghraphy . just think about it for a second and think about what smartphones have made us be ... and interpret the rest . Imagine the kids of the next 20 years"
2024-03-29,"When the headset start to comunicate with another closeby headsets, and share AR assets in the room
like sitting in a room with another person, both using the headset, and you put down a shared tabletop game in a table, and both see it and can play
This is crazy tbh"
2024-03-29,"Thanks for mentioning Macintosh as an example in the intro. That‚Äôs my go to example to friends. I didn‚Äôt buy one for what it can do today, but what it could possibly be capable of in the future. Remember, Macintosh was a curious toy when it was released. It wasn‚Äôt until Aldus Pagemaker was released over a year later that Macintosh got its killer app. What will be Vision Pro‚Äôs Aldus Pagemaker. And how will the OS evolve going forward‚Ä¶"
2024-03-29,This feels like the perfect example of a product being held back by the technology of today
2024-03-29,"We should be very used to be now, the 2nd generation of Apple products being evolutionary and not revolutionary. The revolution normally comes in the first of something, and it takes a good 4-5 series before we see real refinement. This may legit, take 10 years to see the real improvements we want. Like being able to ditch passthrough and Eyesight for true passthrough and illumination. Transparent LED screens are getting there, but that's not the only real technological leap to get there. I don't think you will see Eyesight on the Apple Vision, and I think its going to be very conservative in terms of its features. I think we will see passthrough, but not Eyesight."
2024-03-29,The aluminum bezel/frame and thick glass reminds me so much of the first gen iPhone. That thing was a tank. I actually really liked that first design. It felt sturdy
2024-03-29,"In 1983 I bought a McIntosh. I paid just above 3,000. If I recall it was 128k and functioned on floppy disk. It was revolutionary"
2024-03-29,"I feel like one of the absolute best real world applications of this headset or AR in general that no one seems to talk about has to be CAD design. Having a physical, 3D, spatial, to scale reference model to work with could be absolutely game changing, especially if it becomes the norm. Even if it remains a niche use case similar to the 3Dconnexion Spacemouse line, it could still greatly affect the way people consider CAD as a whole."
2024-03-29,"There is a game called Wrath 2 on Meta Quest 3 that will put you in the most insane VR Experience Ever! It‚Äôs unexplainable how immersive and crazy it is it will trigger everything you have in you literally fighting giants, gods and huge monsters.  The sounds and animations will literally blow you away, and yet Apple has a ‚Äúvacuum cleaning‚Äù game and we call that ‚Äúawesome‚Äù‚Ä¶.because it‚Äôs Apple. It‚Äôs sad."
2024-03-29,"Imagine playing something like Clash of Clans,, Subway Surfer, League of Legends, Clash Royal, and other such stuff played in a space around you, where you can walk across the field as you send out your units/build/make"
2024-03-29,Can't wait to see this in 10 years or so.
2024-03-29,he summed it up perfectly. hands down the best review on this product. This is why he's the GOAT !
2024-03-29,Just put a 360 camera on courtside and record it LIVE. And you can watch it like you're there.
2024-03-29,I can't get enough of these Apple Vision Pro videos from Marques. Love to watch these
2024-03-29,The tunnel/vignetting is actually probably a UX design choice as through extensive research it was learned that having a soft vignette around your FOV alleviates many user edge cases of motion sickness from standard usage of VR devices with this form factor.
2024-03-29,"As one that was around for the introduction of the personal computer, I think Apple has done a fantastic job.  I remember when the iPhone was introduced and I was amazed that one could have websites on a portable device.  That was the most important aspect of the iPhone.  All the heavy computing  lifting would be done online and then the response would be sent back.  No need for a very powerful computer.
With the Vision Pro, the huge advance is the lack of need of a large environment for a large environment experience.  As the price decreases, tech evolves, apps get better, I predict these will be quite common."
2024-03-29,Iphone is literally the WORST example of technology advancing
2024-03-29,"I bought the set, but had to return cuz I'm crossed eyed and it is never in focus..."
2024-03-29,wow
2024-03-29,That audio transition using the same mic at 0:23 though... So clean.
2024-03-29,"The size of pixels on screens so close to my eyes is the reason why I still have not bought into VR for gaming, so I'm really excited to hear that this problem is being solved. I hope other brands will follow."
2024-03-29,"I‚Äôve spent about 8 hours with the Vision Pro, here are my quick thoughts
1-computing in your field of vision is amazing
2- the quality of whatever you are working on or viewing is excellent
3- the Spatial Audio is excellent, sounds come from wherever the source screen/app/window is. Music quality is very good
4-navigating the Vision Pro is intuitive and quick once you‚Äôve used it for a few minutes
5- movies on the Disney+ app appear in 3D
6- apps made for VP are easier to use and engage with than compatible apps
7-Vision Pro is heavy, with pressure becoming an issue on forehead and the cheeks
8-Battery life is meh, but I‚Äôve not worn them for longer than 60-75 minutes
9-need more apps
10- this is a look at the future of personal computing, very exciting and cool"
2024-03-29,I will buy it when I get you 85% discount coupon code !!
2024-03-29,I found Casey's review so hilarious
2024-03-29,I saw somewhere where somebody said that ‚Äû when u was a kid everything looked more saturated and as a adult we see this not anymore‚Äú i think because u see thru the cameras maybe one day we will get so addicted to saturated life and when we don t have the glasses on we will think that our world is not that beautiful anymore
2024-03-29,"I think Marques is getting a farmers tan on his face from wearing this thing so much  awesome video bro, keep up the dope work!"
2024-03-29,13:22 lol
2024-03-29,Wow the thing about the fuzziness of the screen when you‚Äôre not focusing on that part is genius! I noticed it in screen recordings but I thought it was just some compatibility thing or bad screen recording software. Thank you Marquez for being thorough as always!
2024-03-29,"Your tech narration and video presentation style is definitely one of the best if not the best in the world. I've enjoyed watching these videos a LOT! And I am sure when you review the 2nd and 3rd generation of Vision Pro, I'll come back to these videos just to appreciate how carefully thought out your recommendations and predictions were. Great work!"
2024-03-29,From what I've seen so far MB is the only fella who can wear wifi ski goggles and still look good.
2024-03-29,Cyberpunk dystopia in coming
2024-03-29,"I'm here for the push forward of consumer tech! Won't get one since I'm not into the apple closed ecosystem, but it will benefit everyone I think. Particularly excited for the Immersed Visor, I think that's exactly what I'm looking for in terms of productivity (especially when traveling)"
2024-03-29,Wow. A nearly 1.5 hour long 3 part series on this product. This is incredible content Marques. And I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs much more to come
2024-03-29,The Apple Vision Pro costs so much even Marques Brownlee needs to milk every cent he can get out of them with all these videos on the same product release
2024-03-29,Can‚Äôt wait for the vision 6 pro slim max! 4tb! In 2029. For $6500.
2024-03-29,"Thanks Marques. I really appreciate the insightfulness and thoughtfulness in your videos. And the calmness - you're never over-personality-compensating. or overbearingly click-baiting. 

I think for me, the dealbreaker would be the ability to have multiple Mac desktops, because then I could maybe apply it for work. It's exciting and inspiring that Apple have the ability to invest in a forward-looking product like this. There is, undeniably, a public appetite for advancements in this area."
2024-03-29,"This tech makes me excited for the multitasking potential in the future. I rely on a 4 monitor setup at home to do my work effectively, and having that all in a single headset that I could take anywhere to work is a cool thought."
2024-03-29,"I feel the interesting part I wish more people were talking about was the pricing schema - for the AVP to take off, it needs more app support, which requires more users, which requires more pricing accessibility."
2024-03-29,"The thing that sucks is they will put up a paywall as we as reduce new developments in drips to make as money as they can, while also holding back humanity from innovation due to their greed."

2024-03-29,3500 for blurry face facetime calls. Lmao why you banking that i wouldnt have shown it all looks like a child rendered it in 2.7 blender
2024-03-29,"The main thing I learned from this is that you have excellent taste in music. I saw daft punk, porter robinson, madeon, and knife party on your Apple Music app."
2024-03-29,"The thing about the early Mac, the first iPhone, etc, is that yes they were radical but they didn‚Äôt fundamentally have to change design to be accepted by the paying customer. The version we have now is essentially the same as the first version. The problem with the Vision Pro is that the headset design just isn‚Äôt something most people want to wear. I could be wrong of course. Fun to spend an hour playing with but then I imagine you‚Äôd put it down and very rarely pick it up again."
2024-03-29,Mkb ain't cappin when you see his tan line lol
2025-03-08,"Honestly the most day-to-day ""killer"" features I see with AR are 1. Virtual monitors (huge display, ergonomic, reduced eye strain) 2. An amazing media consumption device. If people could nail down all the miniaturization while preserving the quality of the displays and the fluidity of input, I think that's the next ""iPhone moment""."
2024-03-29,1:13 You forgot the Pro Display XDR
2024-03-29,"The thing I actually like is that I can see a path for this to replace my computer/monitors. Being able to reduce the screens in my house and the ""overhead"" when I'm working at home or on the go. What separates Apple products to me from being a fancy toy is what is it replacing or doing in my life to make it better? The iPod replaced all my physical music media and made it all accessible to me in a new way.  The iPhone replaced handheld phones and pagers first, following in the footsteps of Palm Pilots and such to allow me to work away from my computer. Then it became a media hub, replaced my iPod/Video iPod. The iPad, at first didn't do much more than my iPhone or computer, but it gave me a new better way to replace physical books, giant legal pads and paper, and artbooks in a way that the iPhone and not much else other than E-Readers could. 

If Vision Pro can successfully replace something like that by it's next generation in a functional/supported way then I think it's on its way to being a true revolutionary product, not just a fun expensive toy."
2024-03-29,"15 years from now when we can use this thing and view a football game from a players perspective is what I am waiting on. Sitting courtside for a basketball game...etc. The ideas are endless, but it's going to take a long time to perfect them."
2024-03-29,"When Google glasses, that was disgusting our privacy, 
Apple vision pro : Awesome and Gorgeous"
2024-03-29,Thanks so much for sharing! I‚Äôm very interested to see if this tech advancement is enough to make AR/VR more of a reality moving forward. I love that you looked up at your wall for a floating window when you sat back down.
2024-03-29,"I watched the prequel to this video. After watching them both, I have to say that your analysis of the Apple Vision Pro is the best presentation with meaningful insights I have had the pleasure to watch.  
I'm an old guy and like to watch interesting and enlightening Youtube video posts... and have to say you are brilliant and very much appreciated and valued for your expertise, knowledge, approach and demeanor towards the subject matter you discuss in your video posts. Thank you Marques! Cheers..."
2024-03-29,That FaceTime with the virtual avis is still hilarious . It'll never not feel so dystopian
2024-03-29,"Marques, hear me out‚Ä¶ combine LLM image generation with a feature specifically for environment immersion on Apple Vision Pro. You just talk to the device and it creates the scene for you. (Example: put me on top of Mount Everest. Now add some stormy weather. Now add the sound effects that would apply for this scene.) That would be a banger feature. Custom Scenes."
2024-03-29,0:23 that seamless audio transition had me tripping
2024-03-29,Those transparent OLED displays at CES are looking more useful now...
2024-03-29,"I‚Äôm returning mine, this is really tomorrow‚Äôs tech. The App Store has almost nothing. A lot of review videos mentioned that it can use compatible iPad apps but there‚Äôs almost none. Doesn‚Äôt have a usb-c port to transfer files and doesn‚Äôt have a VR video player. I think this is apple trying to push for their insanely expensive iCloud service. The screen is extremely good with zero pixelation or screen-door effect."
2024-11-29,Happy To See You Anytime !!!
2024-03-29,I‚Äôm obsessed with the Vision Pro but I‚Äôm more here for MKBHD. Been the biggest fan for many many years!
2024-03-29,Can you just put the headband in your mouth and just chew it between your teeth a bit - what does it feel like?
2024-03-29,Great video. Love the watch strap.
2024-03-29,7:41 using a samsung phone while wearing an apple vision pro has got to be the most MKBHD thing ever.
2024-03-29,"I dont get the fuss. All those applications already exists. I get the impression that its the first time they're using VR, despite they're saying its not."
2024-03-29,"Great Video, can't wait until future versions to buy it."
2024-03-29,"As an industrial designer myself, I just see every VR set as an absolute human factors nightmare. God bless the ID teams that work on these things haha. 

Also side note and I mean no offense here, but Marques's studio offices look so much like generic in-game asset spaces I thought those scenes where he was showing us of the footage for the Vision Pro was 100% rendered until I saw one of his coworkers in frame haha. Felt like I was playing Mirrors Edge or something Ô∏è"
2024-03-29,Thanks @mkbhd did you and others use the Vision Pro in the same room? Are you able to see the same screens and work together on the same whiteboard for example?
2024-03-29,97 seconds into the video and that opening B-ROLL was captivating! Bravo!
2024-03-29,Unplugging the battery is not the only way to turn off the apple vision pro and you can press those two butttons on the top simultaneously to turn it off.
2024-03-29,"I want to see an overview of an NFL game, like the F1 example you showed. Imagine how insane that would be. The potential of this thing is mind boggling."
2024-03-29,"Ok, hear me out.
Apple Vision Pro + Dyson Air purifier headphones = Daft Punk vibes"
2024-03-29,"1:57 i know exactly what you mean hahah, I once used my apple pencil so much before my exams, when i went ahead to write my actual uni exam, i double tapped my pen to erase(multiple times)"
2024-03-29,"Thank you for the great review, Marques. You should also make a video on why the Google glass failed. Is it the need for more strategic marketing? Or is it the lack of a spatial touch interface, in contrast to Google's touch interface? I think you (along with other tech reviewers) are well-suited to provide this feedback since you had the opportunity to interact with both."
2024-03-29,"There we go, future news - Apple made - $100 million from Vision Pro sales, MKBHD made 20 million of it."
2024-03-29,"Some fundamental mistakes when it comes to mAh is rated at higher volts, if you was to reduce it to that of 4.2v that most phones use, the mAh of the battery triples!

Also the glass, is laminated with plastic! Please stop calling it glass lol"
2024-03-29,Woah woah woah. Your mouth and the sounds at 0:25
2024-03-29,The Vision Pro fixes a problem that doesn't exist...
2024-03-29,Just came here from casey's video! Great timing!
2024-03-29,ultimate headache machine
2024-03-29,"Holy heck! Watching F1 like that makes me wanna get a headset like this. Holy heck! Imagine your elderdom with this technology. Instead of staring into a wall you can do, see and experience so much!"
2024-03-29,"I was just thinking ""what is the actual use case for this VR headset. What does this do that any of my other gadgets can't?""

7:39 and then you pick up your phone"
2024-03-29,"Hey Marques, the best use case to justify the Vision Pro will be live sport events and concerts. The day we can watch the Champions Leage's final, the superbowl, concerts, or NBA as if we where in court seats for a fraction of the price. All of this without having to buy plane tickets, hustle with resellers, and pay for hotels.... that is when 3.500 USD will be a bargain."
2024-08-31,"I think look-based UX is just as bad as it's always been. Meta's UX for controllerless input, while it is admittedly a bit floaty in its current form and has some trouble deciding what angle to draw the ray from, it is in concept significantly more friendly. There is in fact a reason why we've not all tossed out our mice for Tobi eye trackers. A pointing method divorced from your look position is just nicer to use.

And I'm sure with how much high end tech they crammed into this device, their implementation of hands as pointers would have been just as smooth as their position tracking, and way more reliable than meta's version. Keep in mind, this thing costs 8 times as much as a quest 3, so that's not a dig at meta, apple just has more data to work with due to having more and higher end sensors. As alluded to though, apple does have a stick up their butt about reinventing wheels all the time, so this is likely different for the sake of different, even though this is only different from other look based UX in that you pinch fingers to click instead of staring long enough for the circle to fill up. This is an upgrade on that for sure, but if you've got sophisticated hand tracking already, why only use it to simulate a mouse button and scroll wheel?

I think this was a mistake, and a missed opportunity to have the best controller-free UX on the market. Instead we have two unideal UXes; meta's, which is more natural but suffers from having not quite accurate enough tracking, and apple's which has high accuracy tracking, but only lets you point with your eyeballs.

For what it's worth, eye tracking is also significantly easier to do, and the quest three has their version of look based UX (the old one where you have to fill a circle to click) but it would take little effort to add a look+pinch mode that would be pretty much identical to apples UX. Which is just to say, it seems really odd that they committed so hard to ""no controllers"", had expensive high end hardware, but then went with a UX that feels like a downgrade from the $500 headset's UX."
2024-03-29,"The ""killer app"" of the Vision Pro (VR in general) will be experiences. Imagine being able to watch a concert like you're there, even switching angles, but you're comfortably at home. Or walking through the Louvre without having to go to France. Being on top of mount Everest and digital tourism in general. Similar to how you can fly anywhere in Microsoft flight simulator, you could walk anywhere in Google maps. Businesses could also make more money by charging digital entrance fees.

Edit: To those saying this can be done already, maybe, sort of, but not even to a halfway decent level as far as I‚Äôve seen (including the Vision Pro thus far). And at this price it still isn‚Äôt worth it."
2024-03-29,"Diving into their 10k and research. This product is more about the 6,500 patents that they got from its development. Which will be absolutely priceless for future products in terms of spatial computing."
2024-03-29,"Having more ideas then apps is so true. I have so many ideas, I was Board gaming with my friends and I kept coming up with more kool applications"
2024-03-29,also props to apple for including a second band and not making you pay
2024-03-29,Wtf with these bots spamming ams90k ?
2024-03-29,Can't wait to check the weather on this
2024-03-29,Live streaming Spatial Video of sports would be cool!!
2024-03-29,Imagine watching court side and you can get up and walk on court in the middle of the game
2024-03-29,The sole fact that the Quest 3 has a higher FOV makes it an instnat winner because it will always feel that little bit more natural. It's a big deal to get these little things right.
2024-03-29,"Back in 2018 when I first watched Ready Player One, I said to a colleague ''This will be real in the mid to late 2030's. I was wrong, it will be he mid to late 2020's - crazy. So THIS is what Back To The Future 3 was aiming at."
2024-03-29,I have a Varjo. The eye tracking/focus tech is unreal when it comes to VR video. Almost indistinguishable from the real thing.
2024-03-29,"This thing has endless possibilities.  Truly believe this is potentially a fairly revolutionary piece of equipment if it continues to progress in the right direction.  App Developers should start to jump on this even more once they can get price down closer to 1,500-2k range."
2024-03-29,"I love how the most common complaint about watching 3D movies is that the little plastic glasses are ""cumbersome and uncomfortable""... Meanwhile many of those same people are seriously stoked to strap this toaster sized gadget to their face."
2024-03-29,@17:47 the solo knit band is actually my favorite thing about the headset. I find myself rubbing it and being amazed at how soft it is
2024-03-29,Apple just started paid promotion
2024-03-29,one more year until apple releases the oasis to the apple vision pro
2024-03-29,Marques - You missed that the Vision Pro's killer app (according to Wired) is kitchen timers!!!  I want to see that!  Get cooking!
2024-03-29,I'd be curious to see your reaction to either the Varjo Aero or Varjo XR4 (or XR3)
2024-03-29,This would be fun to try out!
2024-03-29,Just tried this yesterday. The possibilities are endless. Environment is way better than immersive. Pair this with holotile= change the world. The fidelity of training in healthcare that can occur is wild.
2024-03-29,"I think the field of view is the big secret Apple didn't want to talk about and I'm actually a little annoyed they managed to trick everyone into not questioning it and so I'm glad you brought it up. I wondered about the field of view myself earlier today when wondering just how immersive this thing is. I think not being fully immersive with a smaller field of view than the Meta Quest is a big downside. Like, a big big downside. At the price point it should be better. But I know Apple, they will deliberately withhold features with the intent to add it as an upgrade feature. So in the next Vision Pro they will boost the field of view by 10% (even though they'll be able to boost it 30%) just to get people to buy and ensure they can boost it more on subsequent models. This aspect of Apple's design annoys the ever loving crap out of me. It should have had full field of view from the very beginning. But they're going to milk it and milk it and milk it, deliberately disappointing everyone just so they can boost it slightly in the future to entice people to upgrade."
2024-03-29,"Apple make anything, even a rock, 
MKBHD : I love this thing :D"
2024-03-29,"They used your picture in a norwegian newspaper today, was really cool to see."
2024-03-29,0:26 this voice over‚Ä¶ top notch
2024-03-29,"IMO PlayStation got the head strap right back with 2016's PSVR. It's a ""halo-style"" strap that puts all the pressure on the crown of your head, like a baseball cap, while the headset itself hangs in front of your face. There's virtually no pressure on your face and it's great! There are many halo-style third-party straps for the Quest, and I hope there will be the same for the Apple Vision Pro."
2024-03-29,Glad to know you included the F1 tracker app! That thing is absolutely nuts and looks really cool too!!!
2024-03-29,Sword Art Online is finally close to reality! I really like the foveated rendering- there is so much room for AI to do predictive paths of eye saccades based on what usually comes next. Apple blew this out of the water.
2024-03-29,So cool walking around with battery pack and massive ski goggles reg people waiting for the all in one especially at used car prices or half years mortgage
2024-03-29,One fact for sure : the Vision Pro is going to hugely increase the sales for the Quest 3
2024-03-29,3:57 Now that you mention it...why can't my brain render everything outside of my peripheral in hi-res? Was I not released with the latest tech??
2024-03-29,"the money to buy this can serve as my Canadian proof of funds, lol"
2024-03-29,I ordered one. I‚Äôm a software developer with a hybrid work form home and in office setting. 3 of My colleagues had their offices super clean and were working in vr all fucking day. It was intriguing. They let some of us test it out by the end of it a few of us ordered by ‚Äúmonthly installments‚Äù or paid full. Mine comes in on Tuesday. I‚Äôm very excited to use this for work and disney plus viewing.
2024-03-29,"I had a pleasure of trying these out today at my local Apple store. Totally blew my mind at the clarity,  the eye tracking control and hand gesture control. I have the Quest 2 and this Vision Pro made the Quest 2 feel like its from the Stone Age. The pass thru vision is clear and fast. I get motion sickness from the Quest 2. But the Vision Pro did not give me motion sickness from the 30 mins that I tried it out. The downside is the $3,400 price point."
2024-03-29,I really don‚Äôt like the idea of people behind headsets all the time however I truly could see this being a huge benefit for WFH
2024-03-29,Can‚Äôt wait to watch an entire F1 race from the view of the driver
2024-03-29,I really hope we get regular vision at a consumer price
2024-03-29,"this is how you do a review: sober, crystal clear and complete without being tedious"
2024-03-29,Why did I come to this review video after I just watched Marques‚Äô Pros and Cons review ‚Ä¶ because now I really want one
2024-03-29,"I like your high quality vids, either summaries, full reviews, interviews."
2024-03-29,The FOV increases significantly if you take off the lightseal and put directly on your eyes/nose.
2024-03-29,"After watching all these VR/MR videos around recently, went out and bought a Quest3"
2024-03-29,After wearing it for long periods . Did your eyes or brain have to readjust after taking it off ?
2024-03-29,"Marques, your are a born tech product reviewer! The best! Now I understand this thing well. Now I have to watch more. Greetings from the UK."
2024-03-29,"Marques should have included the health issues (eyestrain, headache, migraine, breathing through nose, etc) as one of the downsides that may become a cause of concern on wearing this for a prolonged period of time."
2024-03-29,"If you can afford a vision pro, I am sure you can gamify your vacum cleaner by hiring an actual cleaner, lol"
2024-03-29,"What a waste not using more multi screen when connecting a device. 

Imagine in a connected MacBook/iPhone/iPad that allows you to detach apps into other windows, or just having extra emulated monitors, that will reduce the ""lack of apps"" in the vision pro, while expanding the usage of your current devices instead of replacing them."
2024-03-29,Marques flipped everyone in the UK off at the end  Ô∏è
2024-03-29,Basically gluing an iPad screen to your face. Perfect
2024-03-29,These are awesome. You have to do a Versus Battle: Oculus Vs. Apple Vision Pro
2024-03-29,"If they impliment different eyes, 8-bit, anime, etc..., I believe it'll be worth keeping the Eyes on the outside. No netflix, so I'm not even going to consider buying it. I'd wait until the next ones."
2024-03-29,"Those facetime avatars look like ""The Polar Express"" kids. Cree-Pee!"
2024-03-29,"Ready Player One, but the bad guys 101 planing, with all the ADs on your screen!"
2024-03-29,Can't wait for this kind of tech to become mainsteream
2024-03-29,"what i imagine is when everyone starting pulling out the ‚Äú apple vision 1nd gen‚Äù card, the people @ Ô£ø thinking this was it (for hardware) being like oh crap, we gotta start working on the next one"
2024-03-29,"I've been using VR since 2017 and I haven't tried this yet. BUT. comparing to the iPhone success - that device was a potential daily driver device. This is not.
It's not small, pocketable or convienient to turn on and use, it cuts out the entire existing VR community rich full of games in Steam and really only targets Apple users. That right there is a huge short for most people looking to buy this for more than a: monitor extension for macs, or a glorified movie viewer."
2024-03-29,14:34 Is there a weather or a calculator app?
2024-03-29,"After using it for a day, I can promise you that mine is going back to apple until I get an input device I can hold in my hand. Amazingly half baked even for a gen 1 device."
2024-03-29,So they basically made the strap to look so cool but then you can't use it for over 45 minutes and then the strap they included looks just like the other VR headsets which aren't very comfortable themselves
2024-03-29,"That‚Äôs insane. This was uploaded 16 minutes ago and there‚Äôs already 60,000 views."
2024-03-29,1:25 Maaaannnn!! It's super dope
2024-03-29,"We are already immersed in social media through our phones, if we use this technology in the same way, there is a high probability that in the future we will never view our environment with our own two eyes. Thinking about that is pretty scary"
2024-03-29,I like how he keeps saying how our technology right now is crap. It's like he's a time traveler who knows how far technology will go and chuckles at where we are
2024-03-29,"24:02 when he says ""yeah"" i was like 'thats John Wick'"
2024-03-29,"0:00 ""I actually love this thing, I love this thing"".... gives a slight hint of the reviews final verdict.."
2024-03-29,Of course he loves it. It's from Apple and he must say so
2024-03-29,Too expensive for skiing :(
2024-03-29,Apple making a VR headset still doesn't feel right to me
2024-03-29,Great gadget for one weekend. And fits into a drawer .. where it will likely stay
2024-03-29,"0:15
Opiate sniff and lip smack.

20:20

Gg."
2024-03-29,There's LOT of talk about glare/reflections when for example watching movies with a dark background. A lot! Many people on Reddit and Macrumours are returning their AVP because of that. Have you experienced this?
2024-03-29,"Imagine a lifelike 3D AI assistant on something like that, where you can see it as though it's there in real life and interact in real time. Stuff like that is why I think AR/passthrough devices have unimaginable potential as the tech gets better"
2024-03-29,"No one talks about the possibility of causing eye diseases, like myopia !!
Especially for myopic people !!"
2024-03-29,I wonder how popular it will be to see or do things on your apple vision that you shouldnt be doing in public for fun and kicks. I can se so much excitement for that kind of activity
2024-03-29,I would love to try them
2024-03-29,Good vid so far
2024-03-29,They still look like Ski Goggles
2024-03-29,imagine being able to sit in the stands but you are at home and didn¬¥t pay for the hotell and fly ticket. But just the game ticket. I am so sold for that idea since I live in Sweden and can¬¥t afford and got the time to travel around seeing all the sport events or any events. Being able to watch my favorite team play like you are there in the sits must be an experience. Apple is showing the true potential and Samsung and the rest will follow suits
2024-03-29,13:10 i think it is more about the headset
2024-03-29,"It will take some time to absorb how AMS33W is exerting the most impact in these times. After all the downswings and failures of last year, it's about time that someone merges assets into a efficient scenario, and that's just happening with this asset right now. It will be thrilling to see how they advance this product in the future. What do you guys think? Would like to hear some opinions."
2024-03-29,"21:22
you forgot the possibility of a ""Vision Pro Max"""
2024-03-29,"Every liberal Apple hipster in a city: Mask, check. Goggles, check. Earbuds, check. Hat, check. Hoodie, check. 9th booster, check. Vaccine passport, check. Myocarditis, check. Butt plug, check. Not having to interact with anyone in any way, priceless."
2024-03-29,Can't wait to play with this in the apple store
2024-03-29,Great review man. As always
2024-03-29,"I can't help but compare with PS5's VR goggles. There are similarities. Single cable. Passthrough vision mode. And only where you look at is sharp, everything else is blurry.
And then I remember the price difference."
2024-03-29,"I just showed my mom this video and she was so impressed by you and the quality of the video that she asked: ""Oh, so he's the developer of this device?"" So, for some people... you seem like a guy who casually invents the future of tech."
2024-03-29,"When you asked: ""How do you look better in a coffee shop? With a notebook in front or with Vision on your head?""

My answer:""Definetely with the laptop in front. You look real, human, I can see your eyes and make eye contact"""
2024-03-29,"FYI 7:59 In music, we now use software sythesizers in place of physical instruments. I personally find around 11ms (called latency in music / software syths) to be the cut-off at which it becomes physically noticeable that thee is a delay between me preesing a note and the sound starting to generate, ie the delay between physical action/reality and audio. So 12ms is probably only JUST there; v1

I currently run at 5ms latency"
2024-03-29,Thanks for honesty
2024-03-29,Thank you for the thoughtful review and the joy you bring to this corner of the Internet.
2024-03-29,"It's not as much new technology as a previously niche product marketed to a new, loyal customer base"
2024-03-29,People diss personas but personally I find them mindblowing and this is Version 1.
2024-03-29,I watched this on my vision pro! Also there is a way to turn off the headset btw you hold the side button and crown for a few secs then slide to power off.
2024-03-29,he looks like thanasis antetekunpo when he is wearing that
2024-03-29,The biggest downside is that it ONLY works with an existing Apple product. Its useless without that.
2024-03-29,I‚Äôm not necessarily a huge Apple fan but this is what happens when you let the biggest company in the world cook.
2024-03-29,The box on the chair behind is a nice touch!
2024-03-29,1+12 and 12R review next
2024-03-29,"I would like to see things this VisionPro can do to improve quality of life in people with visual disabilities. If it do well, it will be a big impact for us all."
2024-03-29,I think this would be great for multitasting desk work. I am soo excited to use this. Also with enough time i feel like poeple will get use to knowing where their hands are and what they are doing. Kind of like learning to type with out looking at the keys.
2024-03-29,"No way this is worth $4000. It may be the best, but it's not good enough. Many of the cons mentioned in your video have been cons in headsets for years. You're complaining about the same things I complained about years ago. I have Google cardboard, Samsung Gear, PSVR1, PSVR2, and Meta Quest 2. They've definitely gotten better (Sony did foveated rendering a year ago), but the truth is that the technology is simply not there yet to make headsets mainstream, and you don't need to spend $4000 to enjoy what VR tech has to offer. I think the Quest 2 is the sweet spot. It's functional and you'll get that wow feeling, but you won't regret buying it a week later."
2024-03-29,"The whole ""looking at the wall where the window SHOULD be"" happened with me when I watched Atlantis.  I was playing SO MUCH Windwaker that when an explosion happened in Atlantis, I looked at the remote and wondered WHY it didn't vibrate.  It's all about that trained feedback to your brain..."
2024-03-29,Oo  future technology
2024-03-29,"This will never happen‚Ä¶ but please neuralink and apple combine forces and combine both things together, I want thoughts to become reality before my eyes"
2024-03-29,Amazing review well done bro you nailed it
2024-03-29,this is insane!
2024-03-29,Never saw a review from Marquee that sounds so much like a paid placement. It is such a lame product that could hardly be considered a prototype.
2024-03-29,What a time to be alive eh?
2024-03-29,Dystopian reality incoming
2024-03-29,Fantastic review! Your exploration of the Apple Vision Pro showcases the intersection of futuristic ideas and cutting-edge technology. Insightful and engaging!
2024-03-29,"I'm 50 and I think it seems pretty silly, BUT, my kids walk around the house with their Oculus headsets and they wouldn't think twice about strapping a computer to their head. This will be transformative."
2024-03-29,"Timestamp 13:00  your reaction is totally understandable it's the same as being handed an oldtime cell phone to use  and even though you know it doesn't have a ""touch screen"" you still end up touching the screen occasionally to move or activate things"
2024-03-29,"Honestly the real shocker for the Vision Pro is that the outside cover are plastic and not glass which does not justify the price, thanks from Jerry Rigs now we know Apple always prioritized money before consumer."
2024-03-29,"The virtual Mac display and movies are probably the top two things that make me want the vision pro. That's not enough, but many things about it are very compelling."
2024-03-29,"""I looked up on the wall to where the window would be ...""

We've all been there.  At least I have.  I distinctly remember looking at an old coin in an acrylic box, and trying to pinch-to-zoom it.  Totally got called out for it, too."
2024-12-29,"13:14 yo, I completely understand, the thing sort of bends reality"
2024-03-29,This nonsense crazy expensive gear from Apple will dissappear the same way Google glasses dissappear a decade ago.
2024-03-29,Man that chess game is actually amazing.
2024-03-29,Marques Brownlee is absolutely the very best at what he does...
2024-03-29,"With the new AI,  you can produce 3D versions of old movies.   That,   I would enjoy.   I'm a bit of a nerd with 3D stuff.
Mission Impossible movies in 3D ????   I'm sure I will throw up a few times,  I get vertigo......"
2024-03-29,"a product like this on launch day you can‚Äôt expect perfection, it‚Äôs all experimental"
2024-03-29,The reason why it's so uncomfortable is due to the pressure sitting right over some critical nerves - trochlear & supra-orbital nerves and the infra-orbital nerves. Pressure on these after a while are very uncomfortable.
2024-03-29,This feels like transhumanism. What are the long term health implications  to the brain and eyes?
2024-03-29,I think it won‚Äôt be long before there‚Äôs a world famous celebrity who is only seen in public with these on.
2024-03-29,"Very impressive presentation Marques, thank you"
2024-03-29,Waiting for the Apple Vision iBalls
2024-03-29,I'd be more impressed if they made it eye and mind control with hand visually touching things instead using your physical hand or body movements in outside environment. Should be a mode of choosing.
2024-03-29,I am totally not an Apple guy but I concede that this is cool AF
2024-03-29,"I am an avid Apple hater and it has really ticks me off how cool I think this is. Of course, if any brand was going to bring AR/VR to ""mainstream"" audiences, it was going to be Apple."
2024-03-29,Imagine having a app that lets you have a nerf war for lack of a better word in your own home but 1000x as cool because instead of using a random nerf gun you found around the house you can use a machine gun.
2024-03-29,"Here's an incredibly useful use case for the Apple Vision; communication for those who can't speak or move.

A app could be written where it's a dictionary type thing, and they can select words with their eyes. 

Guestures could be added, such as winks and eyebrow lifts. 

Using a custom AI model, it could learn the habits and way of ""speaking"" and allow for, I imagine, a fairly quick way of communicating!

If I've thought of this, I know somebody else has had the same idea.

It came to me while reading The Count of Monte Cristo, a character named Nortier is a paralytic who communicates through his eyes."
2024-03-29,"Heard someone in troulbe for driving with a Vision Pro in a Tesla...
It had to happen sooner or later."
2024-03-29,I still don‚Äôt understand what this thing is meant to accomplish. Seems like a gadget looking for a purpose.
2024-03-29,That facetime looks terrible compared to what zuck showed off to Lex
2024-03-29,Sounds like the first real MR to me
2024-03-29,"I have a unique idea for the next model. Apple Vision Party Mode where you and a friend can join the same ‚Äúparty,‚Äù and see what the other person sees through their headset too with the objects floating in the same space, but viewed from different perspectives based where you and your friends are standing sitting. You can watch YouTube, movies, or play games together.


In this mode, (similar how to FaceTime creates an avatar of your face when you‚Äôre on Apple Vision Pro), the avatars will be transferred to your friend‚Äôs face, so that when you look at your friends, their avatar face will cover the goggles, and feel like a more natural environment."
2024-03-29,Imagine watching a 3d football game like in the field
2024-03-29,"When we close our eyes and focus on what we see in the darkness its tiny static dots similar to what shows up on a tv when nothing is connected to it, makes me wonder if we are in an artificial reality controlled by someone else but we just accept our reality as the reality since that's all we know"
2024-03-29,There should be third party apps like Android it will become more interesting and widespread ecosystem and many developers for  it
2024-03-29,This is the kind of product that I would want to try once to see how cool it is and then go back to my quest until we have the tech to do this but cheaper. Its also very nice to finally see one of the largers tech developers get into the vr space. It might actually get people interested in the applicaitons of vr even though currently this is just an extremely expensive monitor replacement that only works with macs.
2024-03-29,"i think the vision pro actually changed everybody's perception of the future of Tech, as in its going to be integrated into the human and life, and not be a physical attachment to reach new things in life."
2024-03-29,"I‚Äôm not agree with a picture quality, it‚Äôs not close to what you usually see, it‚Äôs like watching a video 720 P on 4K display. But again, it‚Äôs definitely depends on your eye, vision sharpness"
2024-03-29,I‚Äôm going to quote Carter PCs ‚Äúpeople who say the quest three is better than the Apple Vision Pro have probably never tried either‚Äù
2024-03-29,I'll wait for Gen X.
2024-03-29,"iPhone and iPad are tools that we interact with externally. VisionPro, while external, you effectively interact with the information in a much more personal internal way. Ironically, vision pro is more of a personal computer than those from the 80's."
2024-03-29,"People who give up their biometric information, knowing what we now know.... you deserve what's coming."
2024-03-29,"For me, this is the best product that Apple created. I know some people will tell that it looks stupid, but for me. No, this is something that I would love to have. We just had a new born and I would love to record the surrounding right now. And in the future, he will be able to see the surroundings and feel what its like to be when he was still a child. This device is so amazing for me. I wish I can have one too. Unfortunately, They don't offer this in the Philippines and I don't have money to buy it. But if you'll give it to me I would appreciate it so much. :D I love your contents. This review is amazing."
2024-09-30,This thing NEEDS a hardware keyboard and mouse. It could be borderline practical with all the devices it can replace if they‚Äôd just accept that people are going to use this thing either sitting at a desk or on a couch
2024-03-29,"On the weight, I think it's more about weight distribution on the head. 660g is very light. 
My comparison is a carbon fibre motorcycle helmet at 1200-1400g not to mention the wind forces when actually riding."
2024-03-29,"I wanna play Mario Kart in real life wearing the Vision Pro: 
- Collect coins
- throw turtle shells"
2024-03-29,Google glasses be crying rn watching this.
2024-03-29,Paying almost $4000 for a quest 3 is crazy
2024-03-29,"If they actually allowed multiple screens shared from the Macbook or visionOS was actually based on MacOS, it would be a must buy for me. But now I guess I will just wait for future versions of the Apple Vision Pro. I just hope that Apple recognizes that the Apple Vision Pro could actually be a computer without a limited OS like in iPhones/iPads"
2024-03-29,"I still don't understand how with so many things you mention, you absolutely fail to mention the Microsoft Hololens which did those same things... 5 years ago. For a tech YouTuber I personally think you need to do a bit more research before putting it in a video. My request is to please take a look at the Hololens and compare features with the Vision Pro. Talk about the ups and downs of each platform and how they compare etc. I can't imagine you just magically forgot about it, even if it seems you're clearly a fan of Apple products."
2024-03-29,This channel is really really great ... Thanks
2024-03-29,"It's Apple, MKB, never down, only up! Apple Vision Pro +!"
2024-03-29,Try fly ‚Äúa Drone‚Äù using Apple Vision pro
2024-03-29,You can turn it off by just tuning it off. Press both buttons.
2024-08-01,I tried these I was speechless it‚Äôs amazing
2024-03-29,Zero mention of its usage with PCVR titles should be an absolutely massive red flag to anyone at all interested in VR.
2024-05-03,"Your points about comfort of VR headset straps is pretty accurate IMO. But it's kind of a catch 22. The A cloth or soft rubber strap is comfortable, flexible, flexible, but requires you to tighten things enough that it applies pressure to your face. On the other hand a hard plastic halo style strap can balance things and keep the headset comfortable over long periods of time. But if you tighten the halo strap enough that movement wont dislodge it, the hard plastic halo setup gives me headaches due to squeezing my head."
2024-03-29,‚ÄúPro‚Äù at this point has become a simple marketing tool.
2024-03-29,"Imagine 20 years down the line when this is the size of sunglasses, and the VR/AR, including the avatars, is all photoreal. For 1500 bucks"
2024-03-29,"It's a gimmick. 
At best it's a niche thing. 
Phones and Watches have had a place in humanity for millions of reasons, they accompany us through most aspects of every day life, when we're alone, when we interact with others. Comparing a piece of tech that does not accompany us to live the world surrounding us, but on the other hand, further extract us from reality seems so force-fed, unless... we live in a world no longer worth seeing through our own eyes. 
I'm sure It will be a hit in the US and large cities where people 1) buy whatever Apple sells and most importantly 2)  have serious social interaction issues and want yet another license to distance themselves from their surrounding."
2024-03-29,"I‚Äôm so excited to try that out myself and I‚Äôm sure in the future this will become way better both size and specs‚Ä¶ it would so amazing to use the AVP (Apple Vision Pro) to zoom objects or places far away with its cameras and just brings them closer to your face and being able to analyze more like a spy kit kkk an also able to connect with another AVP to watch the same movie or videos even during face times I just think that would be so awesome. 

I‚Äôm so excited about how it is now though it‚Äôs so historic"
2024-03-29,@Marques Brownlee Apple needs to make a hat mount so it can use a cool looking hat of your choice and use that as the mount.
2024-03-29,Talk about Microsoft Hololens which this apple product is just a copy and maybe refined version of it.
2024-03-29,"Also,  adding a subwoofer to the back of the headset would give a much better movie experience, and counter the fronts weight."
2024-03-29,"Hmh, M2 + Unreal Metahumans. Could be interesting :)"
2024-03-29,"The AVP's conundrum is that for $3,500, buyers expect perfection itself, which at the moment is not possible. Thanks to early adopters for paying for future AVP generations to be better."
2024-03-29,Exactly what I expected to watch  Thanks MB+Team.
2024-06-02,"My air fryer: ding
Him: that one ding
All at the same time"
2024-03-29,7:40 rare footage of Marques rapping
2024-03-29,I don't have to stretch to imagine these Vision Pro type virtual goggles will be integrated in our battle tank designs ASAP! 360 degree visibility!!
2024-03-29,"many moons ago when destiny came out, the coolest thing about the guardians (the overpowered beef cakes you play as for those who have never played) were those dope visorless helmets. Hadn‚Äôt seen anything like that in any other game at least to the degree they did it. Maybe titanfall but yeah. No visor; just there you go. i always wondered how did they see?? of course as time went on you could kinda imagine a few logical scenarios, but it‚Äôs nice to see that finally we‚Äôve caught up to at least be able to project the way they see through those visorless masks. all that to say i don‚Äôt think they need the eye contact tbh. vr headsets are specific, and they‚Äôll be understood even if there is no eye contact"
2024-03-29,"Extremely superb, futuristic device. one of the best reviews done .
However to me this gadget feels kinda useless. The tech is great but it is way too much."
2024-03-29,"Only Pros Ô∏è no cons people's like here 
 It just amazing without controller"
2024-03-29,All of your complaints about wearing these goggles apply equally to every person who has ever been forced to wear a CPAP.  At least you don't have to try to sleep with it
2024-03-29,But this....this thing is interesting
2024-03-29,"Apple will hate you now for calling it a ""toy"" . Best of luck"
2024-03-29,"It will be good also with Microsoft, imagine doing presentation of 3D animated plan showing clients how the project will look like. Business proposals will also be awesome.

It will also be awesome for engineering studies showing everything more virtually.i can't wait for Microsoft one.

I think it will also create jobs and new skills in work places"
2024-05-03,"Once Mac Virtual Display can display multiple desktop spaces, or integrates some variation of Mission Control with a simple swipe left or right, (thinking Minority Report), that‚Äôs when the Vision Pro will probably replace or augment my hardware displays. That‚Äôs the killer app for me."
2024-03-29,I love reviews where is only showing the product and the functionality
2024-03-29,"I‚Äôm really excited to see this new platform develop and grow over time. I really want to see more shared experiences. If you bring two or more Vision Pro headsets together in a room, how do they interact? Can you share a giant movie theater together, or share a virtual tabletop game and environment? I know some of those things already exist on other platforms, so I know it will continue to grow now that Apple is in the game."

2024-03-29,"I love mine, and most of the things I don‚Äôt like can be fixed with software. And you can dim the environment so you can see the keyboard and still be inmersed, use the crown button, I do it when watching a movie and snacking so I can see my lap but still have the environment all around."
2024-09-30,"I honestly just take an oculus, but i appreciate apple trying something new that isn't the same iPhone"
2024-03-29,"next generation will be eyes and ears enhancement.. zooming, thermal vision and stuff.. just crazy to think how this vision pro tech open the door for so much possibility"

2024-03-29,"Seeing Nitro Fun, Flux Pavilion and Wolfgang Gartner on your screen made me chuckle  good taste in music"
2024-03-29,"I dont know. But would be much of insanity to imagine a VR helmet? Because to be honest... you could filter air, regulate temperature, get rid of your phone completely, distribute the weight evenly around your head, have a much bigger battery, cancel noise... Be a thing to put in the morning and remove in the end of the day... Ok in the beginning it might be a little odd... but if everyone uses it... and you have an app that can replace the helmet looking by a persona... I don't know... I think it would be quite interesting"

2024-03-29,"I think Xreal air 2 are better,  

You can use 3 displays on your MacBook  

You can use Nintendo, PlayStation, Xbox, steam deck, iPhone, android, etc. 

You doesn‚Äôt look to much strange 

You can watch 3D content 

You can walk with them 

Are cheaper 

You can watch Netflix, YouTube easier 

Are smaller and lighter 

Maybe there‚Äôs a lot of things that are better the Apple Vision Pro, but I think that if if you think twice maybe you didn‚Äôt need that, you only need something that work well, that you can carry everywhere and easier. Sometimes less is more."
2024-03-29,"The first thing I though when I saw the VP is that it's a shame you can't share your experience, so agree that it is needed, however to say Meta Quest has sharing experience is a joke, that's not a shared experience I'm after.
Also iPhone integration and being able to answer calls like on the Mac & iPad is a must.
I haven't experienced it, because I'm in the UK, however it looks like field of vision needs improving.
The pass through camera's also need improvements, especially in low light
The big one for a lot of pro's would be controlling your Mac through VP.
But then again, did anyone expect it to be perfect?"

A few years away yet but I bet it gets there"
2024-03-29,"Thank you! Finally, a review that mirrors my own excitement about Apple entering, and hopefully redefining A tech category that has for a long time been stuttering. I live in the UK, yet I have an Apple Vision Pro, why? Because I‚Äôm intrigued and because it excites me. You are spot-on, it is flawed, however I‚Äôve had so many jawdropping. wow moments using this in the first 48 hours that I‚Äôve had it that for me it‚Äôs worth it. Great review, sir!"
2024-03-29,20:17 I think see through glasses could be done now or very soon. Ces had lots of transparent tvs this year. All you would have to do is put that screen into your ski goggles.

2024-03-29,"You can do similar private video editing in a plane with any good headset and a virtual desktop, and a black sheet of paper or plastic over the laptop screen. Or lowering screen brightness to the minimum and almost closing it.  Or using screen extension with the one in the laptop being empty of running apps.  If your OS it does not simply allow you to turn it off completely, while still having the headset display on, through screen selection, etc..."
2024-03-29,"this year's CES showcased transparent displays are possible, so having ""casual"" glasses without need for traditional displays or cameras is a must (and augmented latency would also be gone),
another big problem is control, there's a need for neural/brain tracking, augmented with eyesight and hands gestures,
to me it looks like companies and software devs jumping into VR glasses are merely observing market potential and actual reasonable use cases for such tech..."
2024-03-29,"Yeah, might as well just wait for better versions to come out in the future. Whether it's worth apple or some other brand."
2024-03-29,"This needs a strap that goes from the front of the headset, over your head, then holds the battery pack before reaching the strap at the back of your head.  They could even make a curved battery case (at least the inside part) that fits in.  It would balance out the headset. (Take lessons from people using night vision headsets).

Kudos to apple for having so many sensors meshed so well.  As the environment grows and updates come (adjustable FOV, etc) it will be very exciting.  I can't wait for Apple Vision Pro 3.0"

2024-03-29,"Well u know it, samsung is gonna release their own version by 1 to 2 years."
2024-03-29,Maybe when they are on the 5th generation and half the price. Not worth it at the current price.
2024-03-29,"On one hand: Apple usually doesn‚Äôt release things unless they are sure it will do well (or they somehow force it to do well).

On the other hand: Steve Jobs might have been the total genius of Apple, and this is not anything he would have supported or produced, so it could flop.

Steve talked about how the iPhone was sort of the natural progression of computers. No keyboard, portable, many high quality devices in one, etc. the iPad felt pretty natural as well. Simplicity of an iPhone, but bigger and more usable.

However, the Apple Vision Pro‚Ä¶ is‚Ä¶ ehh‚Ä¶ kind of idk who was asking for this, or thought it was the next natural step."

2024-03-29,"I'm scared that in the future this someone will be able to hack into this thing while you wear it, then it won't be that much fun lol
I'm also scared of how companies like Apple are gonna treat such sensitive personal information like biometrics of eyes, tracking emotions, recording audio, video, etc.

Question is that will this thing lead to an utopian or distooian world?"

2024-03-29,I own 6 apple products and find one or two are not so often used but have a niche function. So if invested in this rather than apple stocks it needs to deliver quality escapist entertainment from modern life. This is its niche function for a modernist how needs moments of transcendence. Therefore the buyer needs to bet it will definitely value for price and that is questionable. So no need for fancy features like eyes on glass but a foxed product that delivers authentic escapism.
2024-03-29,Let‚Äôs be honest all these big tech companies shelf high tech technology for decades
2024-03-29,The price point is something people should also consider; the hump for the average consumer was way easier to onboard with phones/tablets/watches but compared to this those are all pretty cheap.
2024-03-29,"I know Apple won't do this because they don't want to undercut their own hardware sales, but if they want to make the price for Vision Pro make sense, they'd include access to a virtual MacBook Pro in AR hosted on their servers. A loaded 16"" MacBook Pro will set you back $8,000+ so $3,500 would be a bargain, plus your screen can be any size, you can have any keyboard layout, you don't have to worry about hardware or software crashes since the virtual machine is backed up in the cloud, and it's ultra portable and secure since nobody but you can see the screen or keyboard over your shoulder as you type passwords or other sensitive info unless they to have a Vision Pro and you're sharing your virtual device with them."
2024-03-29,good
2024-03-29,"This is a great weapon to have on the combat field in many ways!map pop ups, vitals compas etc. But as trails to the public we have to see the downside for using the product to long. as everyday people how would this product benifit besides checking emails calls etc. It's vital to pay attention because bloomer will be doing everything with them on."
2024-03-29,"I'm thrilled to see what future brings in terms of usability for this and similar devices.

2024-03-29,Can you please tell to apple that to attach a chatGPT with voice into vision pro like Jarvis
2024-03-29,Just a heads up unpluging it isnt the ONLY WAY to turn it off. You turn it off like a IPHONE it will display in headset and you slide your fingers to turn off PRESS AND HOLD THE LEFT POWER BUTTON ON TOP AND THE SHUTTER BUTTON ON TOP.
2024-03-29,Always exciting with Apple.  Hate to reflect on how many Apple products we have.
2024-03-29,Can you use eyeglasses with this!
2024-03-29,This is going to be great when Apple releases the 2nd Gen and brags about how they made it more affordable at $999
2024-03-29,"If that F1 app was real, I would totally get the Vision Pro just for that. And the improved workflow."
2024-03-29,"How about, Apple allows us to share our screen with someone that we‚Äôre paired with who‚Äôs in the same room or somewhere else in the world just so we can get a sneak peek of what they want us to show, sort of like a co-working space. Damn! That'd bring alot of developers to the game."

2024-03-29,Steve Jobs would have never allowed to ship such crappy product. He would want the world to get mesmerized
2024-03-29,"If I could afford it, that field of view is THE NUMBER ONE REASON I wouldn't spend my money. And the fact that I've only seen Verge speak on it, was making me feel betrayed or misled. Your original review didn't mention it at all, and I would want to feel like you only end up doing this video because Verge revealed the truth in that regards, but I know these videos take time to be filmed and edited, so I believe you already had this in mind to speak on."
2024-03-29,"i would love to see its use while i am operating on patients especially when I do laparoscopic surgeries.. already did a surgery using Google Glasses which was useful when I was teaching the residents .. especially in open surgeries when the residents can actually see which structures ""i"" am seeing while I am operating.. my radio friend and neurosurgery friend showed me its use for diagnosis & pinpointing the lesion in the brain in the real-time."

2024-06-02,I'm glad I'm old.
2024-03-29,"Apple twisted itself into a pretzel trying to cram all the parts in the headset which makes it heavy. If there is going to be an external box (battery or whatever) they could have offloaded all the processing guts to the box and just have the display and sensors in the headset.

Secondly, they could have offered two versions of it.
1) That comes with the processing unit and the headset.
2) Just the headset and have the mac (laptop or mini) do the processing connected through a cable. This could be a less expensive option and probably be more powerful since it can use the computer for some heavy tasks.

This gives users options and makes the headset lighter."
2024-03-29,"I am an apple user and have been for years, and to the people who hate on the vision pro heres what i gotta say.

VR as a whole is a gimmick, and is kinda dumb. The CONCEPT of VR is good, because it means convenience. However, currently, we just do not have to tech to make PROPER CONVENIENT VR. u guys know the Tony Stark Edith glasses? That is how VR would actually be beneficial. It would mean that the average human can just toss it on the whole day, and not have to have a phone, laptop, ipad, or anything. We probably wont be able to come up with that for at least another 100-200 years. Until then, in my opinion, all VR machines are stupid and completely a gimmick. GAMING is another talk, as i said, VR is a gimmick, and so if youre getting it for gaming, it is completely fair. Or watching movies, you are using a gimmick device to do ur hobbies, which is absolutely fair. But as of VR products for the next few decades or 100 years or so, they all suck.  Here is why they are gimmick:
1. Size
2.Battery life
3. Mediocre interactive experience
3. Price
All of those things are issues that VR and AR have now.
NOW, lets go to postive. THE ONE THING I APPLAUD ABOUT THIS PRODUCT, IS APPLE FINALLY GETTING OFF THEIR ***. Im just happy that they are finally making new things (yes i know this product concept isnt new, but it is a new product in apples line).  The vision pro has many innovative features which is great, because it motivates the entire market to want to innovate as well. This is what we need in tech, we need companies to just not only make their base products, but to also TRY AND INNOVATE."
2024-03-29,"I didn‚Äôt even realize there was a border that hinders the fov, that pretty much made me not want to buy this now. My assumption was that it was fully immersive."
2024-03-29,Looks like a beta product to me. You are so good at these reviews! Thanks!
2024-03-29,You made a very honest review
2024-03-29,The price is OUTRAGEOUS!!  I laughed out loud when I found out how much this vision headset costs‚Ä¶. These VR headsets are NOT comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Waiting for the regular  version!
2024-03-29,This is amazing! Thanks for the crystal clear explanation! Helped me a lot to decide to purchase or not vision pro!
2024-06-02,"A $250 headset has a fully fleshed out game and app store, a higher refresh rate and a higher field of view, than a $3500 headset.

Thats concerning."
2024-03-29,This with normal glasses is future
2024-03-29,"Yeah, kind of seems like if you‚Äôre the early adopter type, this is for you. But until further app development is done and comfort is sorted out, it‚Äôs not a viable device for most for the money."
2024-03-29,What a fantastic review marques apple vision pro i like it its not my favorite but it has all the necessities that any ar/vr headset good sensors good strap and glld software but you and dave are absolutely right about the straps of the vr headsets apple nailed on the straps on the vision pro it looks a lot more luxurious than then its predecessors though the battery life is garbage in this crazy 3500 dollar price tag surely the second gen might have amazing battery life the best part i like about your usage on the vision pro is how you interact with everything that you can show us i love the split screens its lime ready player one overall its a product for those who are reall trying in the vr/ar world id love to see more companies jump in the vr competition now that apple has made one thanks for sharing your usage marques
2024-03-29,Am cooing down to watch this
2024-03-29,If they can gamify every boring chore I will sell my car to get one. The vaccuming one looked so satisfying. As a massive Power Washing simulator fan i would LOVE this.
2024-03-29,"It‚Äôs cool for now, but my guess is Elon eventually passes it all up somehow with Neuralink replacing some of the use cases of phones/computers, plus having starlink to replace the need for communications companies, as their performance isn‚Äôt great anymore (my family‚Äôs phones on ATT is getting slower and less consistent)."

2024-03-29,"Great video! lol we were just talking about this at work and I was like mark my words, when Apple vision 2 comes out, it‚Äôs going to be so much better that everyone with the first gen is going to feel forced to upgrade  until then I‚Äôll probably be chilling with my Quest 2, maybe upgrading to the 3. Still a cool product though, I definitely think Apple entering the market is going to bring some much needed attention and development to it!"

2024-03-29,Your explanation extraordinary bro
2024-03-29,"You can use it only as an iPhone/iPad. Clearly it will improve, but it's literally a computer like your phone, but you can't run desktop apps on it (maybe the overhead of rendering the 3d interface slows it down, but it's a computer)"

2024-03-29,OK but imagine Google street view with your avatar or something
2024-03-29,The NBA streams courtside 3d content. I watched it with the Samsung VR which was terrible and it was awesome! I can't imagine this. The Superbowl on a huge screen.
2024-03-29,"I see apple making and developing for sport wear use for the Apple Vision. Action Sports, Motorsports, and data can work very well also the cameras, and recording.
Not only you will get info this will gamify your world and have hud displays. Also not to mention the actual goggle cam and actually see what you are recording no use for GoPros and Insta360s.

Until the Tech Gets better this ‚ÄúVision‚Äù will be realised sooner."
2024-03-29,You could honestly solve the reflections issue by putting a clear matte coating on it.
2024-03-29,"Vision pro will not likely be adapted by most of the Apple users as neither it does solve a specific problem nor is it easy-to-use / comfortable. Assuming mainly Techies, designers or some other particular professional groups will reap benefits of Vision Pro."
2024-03-29,What are the reasons for building an app for any of Apple's platforms including the Apple Vision Pro when they are taking 30% of the developer's revenue?
2024-03-29,Wow yes

Don't u think so."

2024-06-02,"This video should be titled ""The worst Apple product I've ever reviewed... for now"""
2024-05-03,So what you‚Äôre saying here is that they released it before it was optimal so that they can say for the new iteration it‚Äôs new and improved and charge people more money to buy the new and upcoming Vision Pro plus.
2024-03-29,this is amazing i am thinking of buying this in the future
2024-03-29,"imagine in the future with a dron a one of this seeing you in third person like a video game, how crazy that would be"
2024-03-29,"They are probably gonna use all the R&D, income and lessons learned to create a Vision (basic) version that will be significantly cheaper and leverage all the trickle down technology from the Vision Pro. I might start saving to buy one."

2024-03-29,thanky you for sharing
2024-03-29,This thing has the same hype just like what the microsoft's hololens had back then in 2015. People are just too stupid.

2024-03-29,"This opens up so many opportunities to evolve entertainment. For instance, imagine being able to watch a football match while following the players on the field. What about gamifying a F1 race by allowing people to also participate in it as a virtual racer like a game?"

2024-03-29,Well sometimes I try to pass the song mimicking the gesture you'd do on AirPods Pro when I'm not using them so I guess is an acquired thing from using a product a lot
2024-03-29,Imagine someone robbing the apple store and using the apple vision pro and a mask to hide there identity
2024-03-29,"I think in order for this to work in the real world, home tech and VR AR have to have a baby. I think turning all these headsets into home projectors that go on your ceiling is the version of these technologies people would use"

2024-03-29,Im looking forward for apple vision air
2024-03-29,"This is dangerous.  And you should think about what you are endorsing and introducing to the world, that could change people's grip on reality that so many already have an issue dealing with in their reality-based lives. 
This will become a future escape from everything that is real in the world now. 
This could even be responsible for the decline of the world's population, because so many will be willing to give up physical in person relationships and love for an alternate digitally created emotion that takes the place of human interactions."
2024-07-02,I just read they didn't sell many of these and a lot of people returned them? You seemed so excited about it 4 months ago.

As of now , it's seen as a novel high-tech toy fitting for juveniles."
2024-03-29,Field of view and what people like and feel comfortable with varies with users. FPV googles have different camps who swear by larger or smaller FOV. I think that might need to be adjustable to accommodate people‚Äôs preference should it increase in the future.
2025-02-27,I love the blue shirt guy
2024-03-29,How does this work for someone who wears glasses? I haven‚Äôt seen anyone really cover this.

2024-03-29,"I burnt my fingers on a lot of v1 products, including Apple's Newton and their first VGA digital camera in the mid 90s. There is no question that v2 of this product will be substantially better, and as more people are willing to buy it they will hopefully also lower the price by at least a grand. That's when I will not be able to resist anymore :)   I wonder if the important passthrough to get us to real AR can be achieved by replacing the two monitors for the eyes with reflective clear mini projection screens..?"
2024-05-03,"I will wait for the cheaper, version in a couple of years (I think I waited the same amount of time to buy an iPhone - I started buying mine at version 7)."
2024-03-29,"meh, integration with macbook is a great feature, but that's about it. I still think google glass was a better idea, but it was released too soon. By the time solid state batteries get mass produced there might be some impressive low powered processors that could bring products like google glass back. They might even replace smartphones that are constrained by screen size."
2024-03-29,"You want to go to an NBA game with those things on your face. Watch an NBA game, live and in person, on a screen in front of your face. I have to ask anyone that reads this.

Staring at a phone already takes away virtually all awareness of what is happening around you. Having this on your face will make you completely unaware.

2024-03-29,I wonder if Apple got the Vision Pro idea from the movie ready player one?
2024-03-29,Just returned mine after 3 days of use. Super cool but still a toy and VERY uncomfortable.
2024-03-29,Watching this on my vision pro
2024-03-29,You can't really call a feature iconic when it's the first gen model. They could absolutely ditch the goody bits of this device and clean it up for future adoption by more people.
2024-03-29,Isn‚Äôt this dudes livelihood directly tied to our adoption of new technologies? Out of everyone discussing our future relationship with technology anyone with a profit motive ought to be discounted.
2024-03-29,Chromatic aberration  - new vocabulary alert

That is it's winning benefit. It's hearing has to improve."
2024-08-01,I've watched your reviews about these and one thing is lacking. The sound side of things - you skip over it - why? It is the factor that will determine if I buy these and I cannot find anything anywhere. Can you use iPod instead at the same time? How much 'leakage' is there if you are on a sensitive call do people hear you that much? Appreciate your reviews well done. When watching a movie - how close until someone can hear?
2024-03-29,"My problem with VR is that it's not something I can replace with my PC. Everything you can do on a VR headset, you can do the same on a computer (and more) and it's comfortable. I had a Quest for 6 months and mainly used it to watch VR porn. There really was nothing else I found interesting about the product.

Perfecting VR is a long road. You can release as many competitors as you want, but it all comes down to comfortability and if it's something a customer can use on a daily basis instead of other devices."
2024-03-29,Can I make a Fursona instead?
2024-03-29,"imagine watching a nba player dunk with this live, not on the side, but in the court, under his crotch"
2024-03-29,"I never read somewhere something about the following question, how does a prolonged use of VR affect our eyesight or regularly using it for a couple of months/years? I think that is also an important topic, since we are advancing with technology, which is great, but we also are downgrading our health along the way."

2024-06-02,I still have absolutely no idea why anyone would want to use this over their own two eyes and a smartphone
2024-03-29,I feel like I would use Eyesight if they let me use a cartoonized avatar or even just a completely different avatar than trying to create a realistic one. When they announced the vision pro I could not stop laughing at how derpy eyesight looked.

2024-03-29,‚Äú‚Äò30-45‚Äô minutes to have to this off ‚Äú - I think Apple might have designed that purposefully
2024-03-29,I think Apple ultimately knows people want something that doesn‚Äôt look like ski goggles and we all really want a regular looking pair of glasses that do the same as the AVP but they don‚Äôt have that tech yet so the AVP is to keep everyone entertained
2024-03-29,"OMG the subtitles always turn on whenever i watch one of your videos. it's so anoying. Also the voiceover in my language sounds so bad. I wanna see/listen/watch the real you, not proscetics. I have to turn many things off anytime you get in my screen. SO annoying."

2024-03-29,they called google glass users 'glassholes' ... the dudes i've seen walking around with these on youtube seem beyond 'glassholes' ... words can desribe.
2024-03-29,Its even scarier seeing people walking around with that thing if the FOV isn't great. They are basically wearing blinkers.
2024-03-29,"What I think will be cool and the future of these is real world channels. Imagine, let's say,  capital cities too start with, you could walk the main street and select Disney channel. It would be like getting around in town town from Rogger Rabbit. Imagine it's Chinese new year you select the appropriate channel for your area if available. Now your seeing dragons and shit flying around, fire works etc. Sporting events will be crazy. The will be the real world and an inhanced world or a fourth dimension essentially."

2024-03-29,The fact that it's heavier than Meta Quest despite basically having to use wired like some ancient telephone don't sit well with me.

2024-03-29,"Just as with the cells phones, I will be anxiously waiting to see what other companies come up with to compete with this headset. Android and other companies are known for providing that 'unlocked' user experience- I can't wait to see what their responses will be....either way, I hope this boosts my apple stock lol"
2024-03-29,You seemed impressed with their implementation of foviated rendering. Have you had a chance to try the PSVR2? How does it compare?
2024-03-29,You‚Äôre lying if you‚Äôre saying you don‚Äôt want one. It‚Äôs just unattractive because of the price

2024-03-29,"I mean it's cool. But I feel like it would become like my current Quest. It's a cool device, used a lot at first, tappers down throughout the year, and then just a paperweight. 

AVP isn't the first to market by a long shot. Even the cheap Quest hasn't taken over the world. At $3,500, Apple isn't going to change that IMO."
2024-03-29,I‚Äôm buying it if someone makes that vacuum game
2024-03-29,"I think you know this is going to be a scenario of the original iPhone. You know if you remember the launch of the original iPhone you remember how much hate it got. People were constantly saying that there was no way it was going to amount to anything because who would want a computer in their pocket and basically criticizing the whole premise as being a gimmick, but as we all know that obviously was wrong and we all know what it eventually led to.

I think this is going to be the same type of watershed product. It's going to basically usher in the augmented reality revolution. And I think for all the flaws of this initial product within two or three generations we will see that truly good product, you know the one with a built-in battery and the one that can last all day with no problems. We'll also see the software side fully utilized and we'll see app developers come on board whole hog and create engaging novel uses for the tech.

I mean just imagine three or four generations from now, we will see the promise of actual glasses style augmented reality, perhaps. Where you effectively get the same tech and user experience that you get with the current vision pro but it's in a traditional eyeglass form factor, which essentially means that it will have no detriment to the quality of life in terms of usability.

In some ways it's disheartening and disquieting to imagine this and it's successors and doppelgangers as our future, however I'm excited for the ride and excited for what comes next."
2024-03-29,Idk why people complain about the price. Microsoft Hololens cost more than this and was a complete joke.
2024-03-29,"I love, he just cannot said ""Don't buy it"" at the and of the video..."
2024-03-29,I was hoping you would have included the spatial picture and video-taking with the Vision Pro and or iPhone 15 that you could view on the Vision Pro! Maybe include it down the road.
2024-03-29,"While it might be true, I don't think the lack of apps is a reasonable criticism. What revolutionary new tech ever had full third party developer support?, upon the 1.0 version launch? Not the desktop PC. Not the smartphone. This is a PRO version released exactly so those developers can start to develop for it. You never once mention the target audience of the PRO: The friggin' people who will be writing said apps! This is not a consumer model so stop pretending it is."
2024-03-29,"The F1 thing i see being a thing in the near future due to the ""multi viewer"" app that already is a thing they would just need to make this into a apple vision app and this would  be brilliant."

2024-03-29,"finally,, some honesty, but not 100%: you're mistaken about what people want from VR ‚Äî most want GAMING. And gaming isn't coming to Mac. So ;-)  You also ""forgot"" to say that this ""glass"" scratches from your nail. It's a one hell of a financial liability to your wallet. The amazing tech is not polished and is more a tech showcase than something you'd really use. And it HAS to be said more clear and loud. Years will prove if this goes to be developed more or be forgotten as an expensive, but funny experiment. As ""honest"" as you are, I'd love even more of it."
2024-03-29,I think this was intend for developers and it's research for building an affordable better model for general public.  The people that have the ability to improve the apps and tech can afford this so Apple makes a little money while they sit back and let the app store build and tech get slightly better and then hit the world with quest killer.
2024-06-02,"This was a good video. Although far more advanced, I kept thinking of the Microsoft Hololens and how it seemed way ahead of it's time. Do you think Apple might at some point pivot away from Eyesight to a more translucent implementation?"
2024-03-29,"@mkbhd , I was thoroughly compelled by your series of reviews for the Apple Vision Pro.

However, I found Brian X. Chen's NYTimes review (Vision Pro Review: Apple‚Äôs First Headset Lacks Polish and Purpose) to be more critical, in-depth (for example, there was no mention of the nauseating factor in your assessment) and less diplomatic, which is what a consumer is hoping for from a reviewer when considering an expensive purchase. (It's probably no wonder that Apple declined to provide an early review unit to The New York Times as they knew their columnist wouldn't hold back!)

Not taking away from your reviews, but in future, I would consider pulling no punches. (Although Apple may remove you from their Xmas card list, as a result.)

Kind regards x"

2024-03-29,Thanks for the great reviews on Apple Vision Pro. One of the main things of interest to me is being able to work on my mac as a passenger in our Tesla Model 3 while my wife is driving. I have seen some videos showing tracking errors or some similar message. Have you tried this out? Have you (or anyone else) found a workaround?
2024-03-29,"This just reminded me of how much ""work"" God put into making human eyes, not to mention the human body."
2024-03-29,I whent to the Apple Store in nyc on 5th avenue and I found out the biggest flaw in the Apple Vision Pro. If you have lazy eye you can only use it without contacts in. There no lenses you can pop  in. If you do not get a headache after you taken off your glasses for a wile and your visions not blurry you still can‚Äôt use it. Since  one eye move differently then the other the device can‚Äôt use eye tracking. Big miss so my daughter and wife can‚Äôt use it. Can‚Äôt even try it out. It just won‚Äôt work. They told me they have made it work with lots of disabilities even people with one eye. So this is a big miss.
2025-03-15,"vr still needs it's killer app, and that sure aint gonna be Apple or Meta, we really need another big player, or nintendo"
2024-03-29,"Can I just express my concern for the skull deformation. I mean if the light pressure of a headset is enough to reshape a grown man‚Äôs head, what will be the impact for kids? Is it cool yes is it well thought out by far no. I definitely think there will be a lawsuit coming Apple‚Äôs way. If this technology is not quickly improved."
2024-03-29,The PSVR2 does the rendering thing based on where you‚Äôre looking I think
2024-03-29,"You can't compare it to the iphone, before the iphone everyone had a phone already, nobody actually uses VR headsets apart from VR Chat degens, I don't think its comparable."
2024-03-29,"Vision pro can make you feel isolated from family and friends. No shared experiences and don't forget headache,"
2024-03-29,"While the F1 looks crazy good, the vacuuming looks horrendous. It's far too lenient!"
2024-03-29,"I know people are working on It, but Yu-Gi-Oh like in the snime would be awesome"
2024-03-29,"I don‚Äôt think this is going to be the next iPhone, for Apple. I think it‚Äôs going to be the next Newton."
2024-03-29,19:44 pause - tml
2024-03-29,i think this is an incredible first step in an very interesting direction. So far this is just a fancy toy (as you said) but it's possibilites are insane. If i just get to play a game while dusting :D
2024-03-29,How much do they pay them? I mean to Big Youtubers? :D
2024-08-01,Apple really should've shipped this with elden ring installed
2024-03-29,Inform them correctly! You can turn it off without using the battery
2024-03-29,i think the google glass is way better than this VR headset. Google ahead of its time
2024-03-29,"I totally get that leaning negative towards apple products means you won't be invited to their events and won't be privy to a lot of exclusive stuff, but even by that line of reasoning...this is a bit much. The praises here lol"
2024-03-29,hey MKBHD do the Vision pro work with people who suffer from  astigmatism
2024-03-29,This might actually kill Theatres and Television if that technology become advanced as intended in the future.
2024-03-29,"I think instead to portray our eye with our image, Apple need to give an option to use emoji eye to portray our eye."
2024-03-29,The more this ish comes out the more step away from technology thinking about going back to a flip phone
2024-03-29,"Vision pro 3 will be like normal ray bands glasses, that you can even see your eyes."
2024-03-29,"I think the eyes at the front look so bad that they‚Äôre an active turn off for this product. The version in the ads was already pretty weird, and the actual version being so much worse is hilarious. I think they should just put cartoon eyes on there or an animated screensaver and call it a day."
2024-03-29,can you watch someone welding?
2024-03-29,"bro, you can screen record in it, ath 4k cheyyathe normal cheythal you can record whatever you see through it."
2024-03-29,Me watching whilst never planning on buying this Ô∏èÔ∏è
2024-03-29,"Bro, stop saying it's a VR headset. It's an AR headset. It won't be as capable at VR compared to actual VR headsets."
2024-03-29,This looks stupid. Hope it‚Äôs the next Segway like flop.
2024-03-29,"Honestly I wonder if other companies like samsung will get into this market after seeing what Apple has done with theirs (yes I am aware of the vr capabilities that they removed from samsung and Google devices, however I'm talking about an official headset like apple's and oculus's)"
2024-03-29,"Your conversation about the headband actually makes me curious if I could find some sort of a headband system for my Odyssey headset because it uses the same tightening system across the back with no real overhead band and there's so much that goes wrong in the first 30 minutes of usage just getting it comfy, not overly fogged up cause the seal isn't quite right ,etc."
2024-03-29,"Less than 4k and can't see individual pixels? May be not the best vision? I believe it has to be 8k for really negligible pixelisation.
Or may be they intentionally made FOV less wide to make pixel density higher. And that's because they just don't have displays and more important a compact hardware to ""power"" two 8k displays."
2024-03-29,I would like the court side sports game
2024-03-29,"great, can't wait to see some popup ads in the face"
2024-03-29,"I think I'll just go n put a vinyl on my turnTable, sit down with a good old fashion book and drink a well brewd cup of coffee. I don't need all that crap."
2024-03-29,Sword Art Online on Apple Vision Pro
2024-03-29,"Very cool
I'm not a fan of Apple, but this thing just gets me exited for what the future holds
Good work Apple, can't wait for an android verision of this thing lol"
2024-03-29,"So its awesome, but wait for the next generation or two."
2024-03-29,WHAT IF THE REASON ITS CALLED VISION PRO IS BECAUSE THEYLL COME OUT WITH A NON PRO CHEAPER MODEL LATER. They just wanted everyone to spend more first‚Ä¶
2024-03-29,so.. how come this is okey to be wore in public compared to google glass?
2024-03-29,craaaaaaaaaaap
2024-03-29,I'd rather eat a 9mm round than let apple augment my reality.
2024-03-29,Welcome to Zombieland.
2024-03-29,"It‚Äôs interesting that Apple is all about AI.  I have zero confidence that they get it right cause 1) they can‚Äôt get Siri right (how the hell they gonna figure out something 1000x more complicated), 2) they still can‚Äôt get iCloud syncing right (messages still doesn‚Äôt sync with the Apple Watch, among other issues ), and 3) AI means different things to different people, and I doubt that Apple really understands true AI!  Yeah, I‚Äôm still pissed about the $3500 price tag of the Apple scuba mask!"
2024-03-29,No thank you. I can buy quests for my whole family for this price. Then we can meet up and play mini golf.
2024-03-29,"I wouldn't buy apple pro if it was $200, you can't use that device in the summer because you can sweat a lot, plus it can get really uncomfortable to wear it long period of time. I own a VR and I had  issue wearing headset devices."
2024-06-02,"I'd think about trying it if it was jailbroken (like a real computer should be. if you can't do what you want with it, it's a toy) and had a good keyboard input."
2024-03-29,And whath about the dangers of the tech. Like the ability to distort the perception of the world.
2024-03-29,Not immersive enough. Will anxiously wait for the apple chip to be implanted in my brain.
2024-03-29,Imagine Apple Vision Pro with dyson zone headphones and custom visor if possible.
2024-05-03,"If it's worse for darker skin people to use, you better belive Apple will drop it. All it's gonna take is one ""Dis racist""  comment when it comes to the eye contact feature, and they will end it."
2024-03-29,This guy has made 50 million in a few years by selling you stuff on behalf of big tech.
2024-07-02,"I have the vision pro and a meta quest 3, and not only do I think the meta quest 3 is better for its value, I thinks it‚Äôs better because the vision pro is just a wen browser in VR, and along with hundreds upon thousands of games on the quest 3, the quest 3 also has a web browser"
2024-03-29,Future is near
2024-03-29,"Basically, don't buy it now. A lot of work ahead. Myself, I don't think I will buy it in the future either and it's not about the money. Honestly, It looks ridiculous just like the Tesla truck. Seriously people."
2024-03-29,Stevie Wonder gives it 10/10. Thats good enough for me.
2024-03-29,"Come on Apple.  That‚Äôs not only for inside use.   Why would I want to walk around with something that big and heavy on my face?   

Make it a glasses."

2024-03-29,Looks ugly to me
2024-03-29,"Augmented reality is an interactive experience that enhances the real world with computer-generated perceptual information. Virtual reality is the computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional image or environment that can be interacted with in a seemingly real or physical way by a person using special electronic equipment, such as a helmet with a screen inside or gloves fitted with sensors. Learn the difference cause you sound like someone acting like they know what they're talking about"
2024-03-29,"Zombie land, how you can like that?"
2024-03-29,VR and AR do make me sick. I would totally look into getting one of these for advanced productivity and being able to save space.
2024-03-29,Apple could easily use the cameras and AI to detect if the user is driving while using it and deactivate the vision pro
2024-03-29,Wow say goodbye to TVs and computers
2024-08-31,No YouTube app is crazy!
2024-03-29,Did you ever get your hands on a Microsoft Holo Lens? This is basically Apple version 8 years after holo lens first release.
2024-03-29,Apple should make a strap looking like a Baseball cap
2024-03-29,just because u can doesn't mean u should.
2024-03-29,Nitidez a very good scren
2024-03-29,yup this thing really look like its from future damn
2024-03-29,Oh damn i thought they were transparent screens... So you're just looking at screens from a camera ??
2024-06-02,"My problem with apple and this idea of the vision pro is that while they want to have it be a productivity device, it lacks so much of what makes a productivity device. I got a quest 2 last week and i still think vr is a gimmick (because it is) i enjoy it more now that the software has caught up. When the quest 2 got real games it went from living in its gimmick to being a cool and fun to use device. If the vision pro doesnt get more software to support it then it will just stay this super gimmicky device. What murders it tho is how god damn expensive it is, for $4k it should be able to do more than a $300, less than 10% of the cost for way more support and entertainment. It has potential sure but they came out swinging with a metal stick while the competition has assult rifles.

The iphone compairsion also kinda doesnt work since the iphone was literally the first of its kind to do anything like it, no other phone worked that way or was that useful as a package, the vision pro is swimming in real competition who've been at it longer. really they werent the first for any of this, they're not the best, and they're not doing it that different. All apple have done is pushed out a device that does exactly what the rest are doing but are putting in different focus for an extreme price. In short the vision pro is just ps vita, an overpowered device with tons of potential thats more expensive than its competition with far less supporting software than the competition and what little software it has amounts to doing the same thing on it that you can you do with the company's main offering. I hope it doesnt have the same fate as the vita but this thing has been out for months and has yet to do something with its potential so my hopes arent high"
2024-03-29,"didn't want to mention the crashing, blurriness, can't be used in a dark room, the pain on face after wearing for a few hours, red marks left on face. etc...? Odd."
2024-03-29,$3499 Apple Lost They Damn Mind
2024-03-29,Xreal AR glasses can do the 3 screen on mac m1 and above and it 300$ instead of 3k
2024-03-29,What if you wear eyeglasses?
2024-03-29,Not a single Quest Pro comparison or reference. Slightly disappointed. Otherwise great vid as always
2024-03-29,"Apple made a ""good"" Job and now we can expect others to make it better and after that Apple will release a 2nd Gen. and youre ready to go."
2024-03-29,Can‚Äôt think about anything else but Horizon Zero Dawn / Horizon Forbidden West ‚ÄúFocus‚Äù device/gadget.
2024-03-29,Sounds like the Vision Pro is Apple's complete lack of or rather disregard for window management poured into a dedicated product for window missmanagement.
2024-03-29,Combine this and the Dyson air filter headphones.
2024-03-29,"comparable price, fewer or inferior specs, MSFT Holoens, and Magic Leap 2"
2024-03-29,The gates of hell opened. This really disgusts me.
2024-05-03,Add pokemon go and you got yourself a headset that‚Äôll fly off the shelves I promise you
2024-03-29,"Device might be good but price is insane. This can never reach a smart phone scale with this pricing. Apple should just give up 100% margin on this a bit, and drop price to 1500-1800 or something so they can make this mainstream instead of a niche device. At the end of the day things like facetiming in virtual reality will only happen if a lot of people have the device"
2024-03-29,"Sonys got the playstation vr2, looks cool playing games"
2024-03-29,It's a  Ready Player One !..
2024-03-29,to turn it off the Apple vision u have to click the digital button and shutter button like a iPhone for 5 sec
2024-03-29,"This is so wrong, I want to see people‚Äôs eyes."
2024-03-29,21:28 Or they just slap a MAX at the end.
2024-03-29,"i wish i could afford it but there's no way i can casually spend $4,000 and then want to buy more than one for my family members, it's just not possible. Apple is really widening the gap between those who can and cannot have their products. Personally I'm happy with the iphone and the ipad but even this new ipad is going to start at almost $2,000 which is not acceptable given the status of the economy. I guess I'm on THAT side of the fence but I refuse to go into debt for pretty toys. As a normal person I need to make smart decisions and it's beginning to look like the smart decision is ultimately going to be to leave Apple's ecosystem."
2024-03-29,"Why are you not talking about privacy issues, that they are recording everything including other people etc.???"
2024-03-29,Awesome review! Can you make a video review on the new XREAL Air 2 Ultra? I am really interested but I'd like to see an in depth review first.
2024-03-29,We need a reset technology is ruining our lives and kids lives when was the last time you saw kids playing outside
2024-06-02,After taking off the headset it does leave a feeling of a sense of void
2024-03-29,Apple did none of these things first. None. Mac? PC was first. IPad? Microsoft came out with that in the 80's. Smart phone? Blackberry. Airpods? Wireless headphones had already been around for years before them.
2024-03-29,"But it doesn't do windows PCs, right? If it doesn't, then it's not that much fancier than the other high end ""goggles"" imo. It's easier to make something work with Apples own products and nothing else since they control everything. But other goggles make it work with most things and that is surely much more challenging."
2024-03-29,Is it just me or black people look better on Vision Pro max or any silver/white Apple device . The AirPods Max and pro look great on them too
2024-03-29,Could you do a comparison to the 4 year old Hololens 2? How far the tech has come and what to expect from MS in the future? Ive seen videos of Hololens 2 using Copilot for image recognition for example
2024-03-29,"Right now, it‚Äôs interesting, but not worth it at all for me (and most people)."
2024-03-29,Ahh this is the beginning it's gonna turn into Ready Player One hah
2024-03-29,"As a product: sure, might be great. But what it means for humanity is catastrophic. I mean, do we need any more time spent consuming tech? Aren't people's minds, time and attention spans not depleted enough with what we've got now? I love your reviews, but not reflecting upon these concerns in the video... how can you not!?"

2024-03-29,How is only your video playing in background on my iphone even though I don‚Äôt have a premium subscription?
2024-03-29,No support for Bluetooth earphones? Airpod ?
2024-03-29,I don't follow the common sense of Pass through using  camera that eventually uses the battery other than like hololens. This is a luxury use of camera to see around the room which you can always see by naked eyes but you're dollars for it. The Apple way.
2024-03-29,Review and compare with the meta quest 3 !
2024-03-29,"If I can do my computer and phone work through it, I will buy. Maybe that's why Apple didn't produce with this capability because it would lose the market for Apple phones and computers"
2024-03-29,"I would really rather have one that connects to my MacBook for processing. Just an input-output device. Ditch the stupid external screen. 

If Apple came up with something like that for <$2000, I'd probably seriously consider it.  As it is... nope, it's neat, but not $3500 neat."

2024-03-29,The transparency  world looks cell shaded
2024-03-29,"The first iPhone, iPad, Watch all had definite deficiencies that eventually came later that were blatantly obvious.  What major deficiencies does the Vision Pro have other than Price, weight, battery range and lack of apps?  Apps will always come, that's what happens with ANY of these platforms.  Price?  Obviously, they aren't mfg millions, tens of millions or hundreds of millions of units to bring the price down.   Will Apple go to polycarbonate? I doubt it, they abandoned polycarbonate for all of their other products.  What could they possibly do to bring the price down other than mfg at scale?"
2024-03-29,It‚Äôs funny that the Quest and Vision Pro both come with very meh straps when it comes to comfort
2024-08-01,Who‚Äôs also watching this on an Apple Vision Pro
