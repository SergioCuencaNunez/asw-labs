2024-03-30,"From what i gather about the fit and wear of the foam tips is that Far East Asians(Japanese, Korean, Chinese) don't have the problems that the Westerners are experiencing. Asians typically have smaller ears, narrower ear canals, and dryer ears. Asians actually have dry flakey ear wax and almost never have ear sweat, unlike westerners that have greasy ""wet"" ear wax and sweat in their ears. Guess Sony did most of their testing domestically."
2024-03-30,EDIT I forgot to mention with the new chip these have dynamic head tracking which give them spatial audio. Although its done fairly well on this pair I still feel spatial audio is pretty gimmicky with music and I never use this feature
2024-03-30,For someone using the XM4 after trying the XM5 I think the difference is nice and day and I suggest you to check if you are not using a faulty one…I’ve managed to use both of them while travelling just to see the difference before selling the Xm4.  The major thing that I don’t like is the price tag.
2024-03-30,Shocking as I have heard the noise cancellation was better than the xm4.
2024-03-30,"I have xm5's, and they have plenty of bass. Chek it if your buds seal good in your ears. When you find best eartips for your ear, they is an exellent for sound and also for NC.
And dont put any eartips on the buds because original eartips have a small net for blocking earwax  to enter in buds."
2024-03-30,"Just got mine and they’re less bulky than the xm4’s and while I absolutely love the xm4, I have to say for my smaller ears the design of the xm5 fit better and offer me better noise canceling in return. Absolutely worth the upgrade on my part."
2024-03-30,"Thanks so much for an excellent review and I'm sooo happy that you're continuing doing reviews. You would have been sorely missed! I had a similiar experience with the XM4s, meaning, no matter how many EQ settings I tried, I couldn't get the volume, bass and overall soundstage I wanted for my personal tastes. I also had issues with comfort. I ended up selling mine. The price vs performance ratio was disspointing."
2024-03-30,"Awww man, sorry to hear your experience. I'm having a much different experience. Sound is superb and ANC is on par with Bose QC II and Airpod pro 2. I have all 3 and the sonys are my new favorite right now."
2024-03-30,"Ohh also, not only does the foam eartips make the anc a lot better than silicone, but the thing you said about the tracks sounding different, here's what the audiofile I spoke to said: ""when earbuds are with amazing sound quality you're gonna be able to hear way more details in different songs, like how they were recorded for example. Old songs haven't been recorded as well as some new songs and with better quiality earbuds you can now hear that more clearly, and get disapointed. It might make you start to change your entire music taste to songs that have been recorded better and such, just to get that amazing feeling"". Basically it's actually normal if different tracks sound completely different with them. Even when you go between spotify and youtube or other places, there's massive differences in the sound track, so.. some songs will underperform, which you couldn't hear before, but now you can :) I will try to judge if this is the case with the earbuds when they arrive at my apartment. Really hoping they have even better sound than the MTW 3 did, cus I was loving that sound quality :3 (But there I noticed the recording differences already between the tracks I was listening to, which I never used to notice on my old jabra 75T elite active)"
2024-03-30,"We agree with your statement about ear buds getting way too expensive for what they are. Also agree about these particular ear tips. Had to replace them with more money spent on a third party silicone tips. Also agree about these not sounding the best.  Even spending a lot of time in the app trying out various settings did not compare with our faves. Have to say that some weeks ago you reviewed a pair of ear buds that seemed to impress you. They were on sale for $35, in llieu of their usual $50 tag. We chuckled and thought...why not. Ordered. Arrived. They blew us away. Comfortable  with some really good audio. Worth the money indeed. Thank you."
2024-03-30,"1:38 Multipoint pairing: you cannot use ANC or ambient sound when using this.
2:48 Speak-to-chat: you have to be the one to initiate the conversation to trigger it. and depending on your sensitivity setting and background noise, it doesn't always get triggered.
3:55 Touch controls: you do not have control over everything. you can select preset groups of controls, but not fully customizable."
2024-03-30,"""This is what it would sound like to take a call in public."" CLASSIC line as always."
2024-03-30,Sound quality is excellent on my xm5's and i have no Battery drain issues like I did on my previous XM4s. Its a good thing you can be successful on the internet with weird and peculiar takes and get praised for it in an echo chamber.
2024-03-30,That's pretty crazy and disappointing that the sound and the noise cancelling are so mediocre for $300. Thanks for making this review.
2024-03-30,"I went JBL Reflect Flow Pro for sport (inline skate) and really I have no complaints whatsoever. Only had to EQ the bass a bit low cause they're overpowered. Other than that they're perfect, great cancelling too."
2024-03-30,The reason you think the noise canceling is worse is probably because they don't fit you well. The seal is critical to an ANC algorithm working properly. Most reviewers found the noise cancelling to be improved.
2024-03-30,"I had issues with the foam tips, could not get a good seal per their app test, both sound quality and ANC were not good
Switched to some foam tips from a 3rd party and got a good seal
Significant improvement in ANC and Sound quality
Suggest you change tips and re-evaluate"
2024-03-30,"I got mine 2 days ago and they are great but I only have a problem with comfort.
They feel (not are) kinda loose although they fit snug so they won't fall out easily. And because they're kept into place solely by the ear tip itself, they don't feel great.
My previous earbuds were the Sennheiser MTW3 and they were a lot more comfortable imo.
A wing on the earbud like Bose or Sennheiser does would've been great to fix that problem"
2024-03-30,"Most reviews I've watched, people say the xm5s are better then the air pods and the bose. Idk maybe they updated it I'm confused."
2024-03-30,"I really appreciate your honest review. It seems like so many tech reviews just gush all over these. My experience with the XM5's has been terrible. Maybe I have a bad pair but the sound is awful and noise cancelling is abysmal. At this price, I decided to initiate a return with Sony and that has taken me a week of run around to finally get the RMA setup so I can mail them back. I have better sounding buds that cost $100-200 less than the XM5's."
2024-03-30,Thanks for your honest review this will most likely save me 299 time to move on to other brand Sony is getting worst
2024-03-30,The first thing you do with XM 4 or 5 is change the ear tips to regular Plano rubber ear tips you will get better sound and more Bass
2024-03-30,"Honestly I haven't been that impressed with Sonys sound quality for the last few earbuds.  
So far, the anker soundcore liberty series have been the best, and my samsung galaxy buds pro 2 have become my number 1!
Galaxy buds pro 2 are best for sound quality right now."
2024-03-30,"I bought the M4 a year ago and I was really disappointed because it was so quite no matter how much you played with the EQ, After that I bought the  Bose Quietcomfort earbuds 2.
Should I I buy they M5? all I care about is sound quality, I want to feel music experience and loud sound.
Thanks!! 
Great video!!"
2024-03-30,"Boy, you weren't kidding about the ANC. I actually thought they were broken at first. After making sure that I had a perfect seal, it performed much better, but the ANC my Liberty 4 NCs absolutely put these to shame, especially in the voice department."
2024-03-30,"Thanks for this honest review man. I am personally very disappointed on this one. First of all I don’t like the case design I really like much more the case design from XM4 and the Linkbuds S which I have. The earbuds design on the other hand I can see that they are a hybrid between the XM4 and the Linkbuds S. I was looking to buy the XM4 but after reading comments about the issue with the drain battery, awful call quality and the size I declined on buying them. And now with XM5 to know that the ANC is not better than XM4. I can say without a doubt that Linkbuds S are the king although they don’t have wireless charging but for me that’s not an issue. It is a shame than Sony instead of improving is getting worst. For 300 dollars and knowing all that they’re not worth buying."
2024-03-30,I hesitate to trust Sony headphones after the battery issues on the XM4. Never thought an update could physically nuke your battery life.
2024-03-30,"I need difference size tips on the xm5 than on the xm4. The silicones are different material on this one. The xm4 felt and looked more bulky, glad it is now bit smaller. Sound is great on both. I have the feeling these tips on the xm5 will hurt my ears less than on the xm4. With the xm4 tips, the tips damaged so quickly, that was such a disappointment. I tried aftermarket tips, but they werent as good as the sony ones. The sony ones are much more expensive though. They should make the eartips more accessable tho if they break."
2024-03-30,"It defiantly sounds like you didn’t have a good seal with these eaerbuds you need to experience the true noise canceling feature with a good seal. Also sound is also effected.,,.i also returned my first pair because i had the same problems you did. Once i had everything done correctly it wash crazy differance"
2024-03-30,Sadly Sony's earbuds have fallen behind in the Sound category as they've been going after stronger ANC.
2024-03-30,Talking nonsense the noise cancelling  on these are amazing im shocked on just over half volume people are sneaking up on me and I don’t realise you need to change your ear tips!
2024-03-30,Dope video. It's good to know. I have the link buds S in my current rotation and I really like them. They sound awesome in many different environments. They replaced 2 of my previous rotation combos
2024-03-30,I bought and tried the XM5's - and sent them back.  The reason - the noise cancelling.  I use the XM4's when I sleep - they damp down ambient noise.  The XM5's do not do this.  The noise cancellation may be better - but you can hear ambient noise easily.  There was no mode that replicated the XM4 noise cancellation.  They were more comfortable - but I prefer sleeping.
2024-03-30,I don't care about gimmicky features for me sound quality is the first priority and earfun S1 is crazy good for me compared to top brands and those overpriced earbuds its not worth spending $200 or $300 to get what you want you can spend much less and get great sound quality.
2024-03-30,"While these XM5s seem like a poor value, the Sony Linkbuds S are so good. I bought them for my wife because her ears are tiny and the Linkbuds S fit her. I was curious to check the sound quality. I wasn't expecting much because they are really tiny. THEY SOUND GREAT."
2024-03-30,"Your new genre scoring slides are excellent! Great addition!
We really appreciate an honest review and you not getting on the hype train. As someone who mainly listens to heavy rock/metal hardcore ect. This is exactly my concern with these. I'm looking at Technics AZ-80's instead.

What trimmer do yo use for your beard/neckline. Looking clean!"
2024-12-30,"Can the Sony WF-1000 XM5 be used as a hearing aid by passing the ambient sounds through, amplified? I cannot figure out how to make that work..."
2024-03-30,First of all i would like to congrats u doing a nice and honest job of reviewing.. I'm a long term follower on ur channel.. Keep up  Always support to ur channel
2024-03-30,"I agree with the ear tips not fitting well and also went to silicone. Unfortunately, I was also disappointed by the ANC. Not as good as AirPods Pro 2 or XM4 and I’ve gotten every single XM model. Thanks for your work!"
2024-07-03,"Thinking of buying these, but I wanted to know how they are for running and gymming? And do the ears hurt from long term use? Thank you!"
2024-03-30,Been waiting for you to review them!!
2024-03-30,"Listening to this review with the XM5s, they are really very good. Top notch ANC, very good sound quality, excellent comfort in the ear."
2024-03-30,would love a comparison between these and the status between 3 anc
2024-03-30,"i would love to see a comparison bettween the new sony xm5 ,xm4, & samsung buds 2 pro & buds pro"
2024-03-30,"What would you suggest trying if my XM5 gets cut out like each 1-2 minutes for a fraction of a second? It happens when im walking and my phone is in my pocket (lets say left pocket), so the right ear would cut out. I tried switching phones and it didnt help, i am using already AAC codec.
Really annoying thing when listening to music and given that these are really expensive earbuds, previously i owned XM3 and it worked just fine (the mic sucked though), it never cut off like this"
2024-03-30,"You named the Bose as best in ANC, What are the best in pure Audio quality in your opinion / Which ones would you prefer over the xm5's?"
2024-05-04,"There is a night and day difference when using my iPhone 12 Pro Max and SAMSUNG S24 Ultra. On iOS, the sound is muddy, really I was disappointed. But when I used the android, the sound was clear and with punchy bass. This is my experience."
2024-03-30,"Hehe no wonder they botched the last firmware update for the XM4 which killed the battery longevity. They had to make this one a clear winner.  Awesome vid as always, looking forward to attempts to dethrone this one."
2024-03-30,"I’m a huge fan of Sony. But I expected a lot from the XM5
The jump from xm3 to Xm4 was so drastically better. But xm5 is just slightly better than Xm4"
2024-03-30,"I've found the sound quality for the XM5s to be very good, BUT only when using 3rd party ear tips because apparently my ear canals are large.  Regarding noise cancelling I too have found them no where near the QC IIs."
2025-01-29,The Sony's  M5's are clearly the best noise cancellation earbuds that I've ever used!.
2024-03-30,"hey man thank you for still doing these videos, I really appreciate this."
2024-03-30,im using a samsung galaxy buds pro at first the fit was not so great but i think better now because of the eartips im using & im very happy with it but would love to try does sony xm4 or maybe the new xm5 but for some reason i love & always wanted to buy the xm4s over the samsung buds pro
2024-03-30,Waiting on the LP4s. You can make anything $300 and call it premium sound. But seems like Sony only cares about blocking out sound and forgetting that they used to MAKE SOUND. THE SOLE PURPOSE OF AUDIO. and if I’m alone in that regard. Then so be it. But I can’t be the only one ️
2024-03-30,Returned same day. ANC is very poor (hard to tell if it is on) and they are uncomfortable. Sound quality and connectivity are good.
2024-03-30,"This is it, i am still processing it, i just bought sony wf1000xm5 with high expectations, but it feels like something not right. I already sold wf1000xm4 two times, xm3 1 times. I ended up with beoplay EX that got missing on my travel. So i bought this wf 1000xm5 with expectation: yes, sony will level up their game in terms of sound, maybe they will different tuning. And i can now : no, they’re not. Yes, its better but not worth the price. When everyone says yo tws is just a bit junk of over processed sound you hear, yes when you use sony.  Any suggestions?"
2024-03-30,"I can completely confirm his opinion. As a XM4 owner for several years, I bought these hoping they would be a marked improvement over the predecessors. And while I would say they do sound better, they suffer from lack of volume. The ANC was far inferior and I did not feel like they were worth 300. There's better alternatives nowadays, especially at that price"
2024-03-30,"Your complaints about the XM5 noise canceling and sound quality suggest you weren't getting a good seal with the tips you used. Maybe you didn't notice the feature within the Sony Headphones app that tests for a good seal.  I also couldn't get a good seal with the XM5 stock tips, but got great sound quality and noise canceling using SpinFit W1 or CP100 tips."
2024-11-30,I was able to get these for half the price and I think they're cool. I agree the noise canceling is okay and I wasn't too crazy about the sound until I got another phone (s24 ultra) and they sound better. To each his own.
2024-03-30,Any chance you had a defective unit? I'm seeing a lot of other reviews of the XM5's raving about it
2024-03-30,Glad you’re still rocking your channel
2024-03-30,"Thanks Keith, I was waiting for your opinion, so me being a bass head and I'm not crazy about the extra high price,  it's a NO for me for now! They would have to lower the  & do a bass update for me to want these ."
2024-11-30,"xm5's anc on really doesn't make a difference with anc off, it just a tiny bit of difference, like 1%? I can even hear me typing on my red switch keyboard. But however, i bought this around 150usd from a sony authorized seller, these buds are legit since its able to register on the website. But still going to Sony center near me to have a check up."
2024-03-30,Downgrade from the 4s. Bought the 5s and sent them back after 2 days. Keep your 4s
2024-03-30,"Thanks for the review.
My XM4 died on me (yeah, one of the battery victims) and I was thinking of replacing it with the XM5
Then I saw the price tag and I knew I had to do some research all of over again to justify the insane 150% price increase.
And I am not liking what I am seeing and hearing in all the reviews, with regard to the XM5. 
Did Sony shit the bed with these? What if they would be able to solve the battery XM4 issue? Would the XM5 even being sold at all? Personally I don't think so."
2024-03-30,"Ok, so once the mailman brings them to me:

1. Slap Comply foam on them

2.Firmware update

3. Tune them with Wavelet app."
2024-03-30,"In your opinion, which earbuds sound the best?"
2024-03-30,"Earbuds are tricky.. ready to upgrade from the Bose QC gen 1.

 I'm hoping Bose comes strong causeI heard Denon Pro Perl is killer"
2024-03-30,"this is GREAT review, i returend it after 1 day and i can agree with absolutely everything you said. I would just add that i had REALLY much problem with call... people could not hear me all, but they hear noise, voices etc in background. I also had problem with bluetooth connection (randomly disconnect) and all that in just few hours of using. I think they need to work seriosly on software"
2024-03-30,Are you able to turn off the speak to chat feature?!?!
2024-06-03,Hey there! How do these compare to melomania m100 in regards to sound quality?
2024-10-31,Given the updates it would be great if you did a refresh on your review as it’s done down in price.
2024-03-30,What buds would give the best bass if not these then?
2024-03-30,"Your review is the only one that I can relate to. They indeed seem to be a step down from the 4s... I plan to keep them as a spare and just hope future updates will enhance their performance, but honestly, I'm not too impressed."
2024-03-30,"I wish you would have gone over the full controls a bit more. This is a Huge change over the xm4s, in which you have to pick 2 of 3 controls, ya know?"
2024-03-30,"Damn, tell Sony how you really feel. I'm just playing around. Basically you're saying they're good buds just not worth $300. Thanks for your honesty."
2024-03-30,Honestly the premium brands have only been putting out mid products lately. Honestly the only one worth paying over 200 bucks for is the airpods pro 2 if you're in the echo system. These will be the first sony wf earbuds in not buying
2024-03-30,I had XM4s and lost them I now bought XM5s. I bought brand X foam tips for both and they provide much better comfort and noise cancelling. I miss my XM4s as I think they are better than the XM5s.
2024-03-30,Mtw3 or xm5 for sound quality? Upgrading from mtw2
2024-03-30,People don't be discouraged by his ear tip comments they're really phenomenal they were designed specifically by Sony for these headphones and they're amazing
2024-03-30,Excellent and honest review as usual.  I was very disappointed with the Wf-1000xm5's. Not comfortable for me and keep coming loose in my ears. Tried every size tips and they are no better. I don't like the foam tips either and for me ANC is nowhere near as good as the Bose Quietcomfort earbuds II or airpods pro 2
2024-03-30,"As a user who bought XM5 as the first ever earbuds yesterday (4th of August). My two cents: 1. low sound quality on all of my 3 fav songs. 2. From the moment you open up a case and try to take out the earbuds >> i knew it was gonna be a mess: hard to take them out and put back (comparing with ergonomics of apple) 3. Constantly falling of the ear and again, in order to put them into ear >> Jesus Christ, you need to do some magic. 4. Not good for running >> they were falling out even while i was walking, so fuck this. 5. Overal >> definitely not even a $100 piece of shit. 

I was expecting a LOT more. Like A LOT. I own Sony monitor, Sony camera, sony over the ear XM5s - i'm very much a fan... but this shit... just got me wanna go: oh GOD! 

P.S. I returned them yesterday, cause they are trully shit."
2024-03-30,Can you please do a review on the Noble Audio Fokus Prestige True Wireless IEMs
2024-03-30,Honesty I've just been rocking my 1more evos over everything I have (which is like 12 other pairs) because well the sound is great and the noise cancelling is pretty damn good.
2024-03-30,"So basically what you're saying is that you prefer the mainstream V-shaped sound signature, correct?"
2024-03-30,"I just got mine few weeks ago.
This XM5 blew me away."
2024-03-30,"Great review thanks!
So as far as sound quality around this price range, could you please give me a couple of suggestions that you would recommend as the best? 
TIA"
2024-03-30,"I had the bose and they were trash! constantly losing connections and I had two of them and I found the anc to not be as good as everybody claims.  The xm4 too big and uncomfortable to wear more than 2 hours, plus out of nowhere the right one only works for 10 min. I use the b&o eq silicone tips for the xm5 and they sound great and the anc sound good. Now I constantly buy Bluetooth headphones to try to find the perfect one and really have been enjoying these, the status between anc and the b&o eq. Airpod second gen is mid at best I use them as a default backup they sound very mediocre."
2024-03-30,"I have XM4 paired with Samsung galaxy note 8 and iphone 14, the sound from note 8 is way better and louder with LDAC on and Dolby atmos on on movie preference. Big difference in sound."
2024-03-30,"I'd say as the updates come, keep trying them and maybe in 6 months from now, do an update at that time and let us know if they became more worth it."
2024-03-30,"On Amazon, it's getting average reviews. Also, independent reviews are also disappointing. People are hoping firmware will fix these problems. Very disappointing by Sony. Releasing them at $300, they should be priced at $150 based from the reviews & problems I read & watched."
2024-03-30,Not sure you heard the earbuds for what they are. If you have a good seal they sound incredible. Without a good seal they don't sound as good as my Galaxy buds 2 pro.
2024-03-30,"Love the video as always man.

Please could you state what is better...these or the liberty 4 nc?

Not bothered about the price difference 

Many thanks and keep up the good work"
2024-05-04,Every track preforms different portable device because of compression rates you need a dac to help
2024-03-30,"Absolutely agree on all points especially fit and anc ,bought these but returned,very disappointed"
2024-03-30,Hey you still haven't gotten shokz openfit??? But got the Sony that funny
2024-03-30,"XM5 ANC is a hype!! Call quality, ANC and battery life still not live up to promises!"
2024-03-30,"I agree with every single point you made in this video. It's sucks, but this is the reality and being honest is crucial"
2024-03-30,I had to sell my XM4's as I could not get them to fit in my ears comfortably while running
2024-03-30,"yes I agree that to me, the xm5 noise cancelling is worse than xm3 / xm4; The xm5 sounds almost the same as it being set to noise cancellation Off. especially at this price point."
2024-03-30,Great and honest review. I don’t like how they look either. Not shocked by the sound. I don’t love my XM4 headphones sound signature.
2024-03-30,"I loved the xm4. But I sold it to buy the Bose. I like the xm4 sound but it was not loud enough on older cds. It’s a shame to hear that Sony hasn’t fixed this with these. I’ll stay with the Bose which has a secure fit and it’s much louder. 
Also I had silicone buds on the xm4 and yeah it affects noise cancelling.  The Bose uses silicon tips and still manages excellent ANC.
Neither these neither the Bose are worth these high prices. Neither sound that good. It’s good for wireless earbuds. But I’ve heard better sound from wired 70 dollars buds."
2024-03-30,I have not got a set of tips to register a good seal in the app.  I went through all of the tips and ending up on the large.  They have the best seal but they squeeze right out of my ears.  I wound up going to SpinFit CP-360's.  These don't register a seal either but the app thinks they are better than the foam tips.  ANC performance is not good for me.  I think the buds work well enough and I bet they would work well if I could get a good seal.  I am thinking about sending the xm5's back.  I honestly think my Linkbuds S are better.
2024-03-30,Man you are going to make a lot of people hate you today:). Much respect to you on this review even though I have never really agreed with any of your reviews on earphones ever...I will say we had the same thoughts on the ANC and dynamics.
2024-03-30,"I just got these and very disappointed about the tone that plays with each tap to the earbuds. There's no option in the app to disable the tone. It takes alot a taps to adjust the volume up or down & a tone included with each tap is a deal breaker for me, I'll be returning them."
2024-03-30,"Probably much better than the Beats Studio buds don't get me wrong they sound bad for transparency and I don't notice a difference between anc or anc off. For 150 usd when the first came out they decent. But on another note I did get the Skullcandy Rail ANC XT, which is 50 dollars cheaper than the beats and 200 cheaper than the 1000xm5 ear buds...."
2024-03-30,"Not what expected, the fit couldn't stay in my ears. I returned."
2024-03-30,Woah not enough bass from these? Im also a bass head so im curious on what would be good bassy earphones that dont sound muddy or muffled
2024-03-30,I can’t believe you can’t answer a 2nd incoming call if you’re on a call with theses (call waiting)
2024-03-30,"Does anyone know how I put my new pair of Sony WF-1000XM5 in pairing mode? I used to hold both sensors for around 5 seconds on my WF-1000XM4, but this does not work on my XM5s."
2024-12-30,"I disabled my absolute volume feature on my s22 ultra, and they get really loud."
2024-03-30,"So I bought the bose comfort II by default. I loved the sound quality and NC but the stubborn fukkers couldn't stay in my ears as my ears don't have a latch for the wing tip. 

So after 3 months I gave up and bought the XM5 on an Amazon resale for 40% off. I agree entirely with this video. The NC and sound quality are not premium but the fit was perfect for my ears and it never fell out even in the gym or yawning. I travel a lot and use neck pillows on the plane and so there is no disruptions like I get with stick earbuds with Bose. The mic quality was also better than Bose and the talk function is useful.

So I've decided to keep it for general use given that it was discounted. But I'm not on the hunt for bassier earbuds for music at a much lower price point and just ordered the soundpeats sonic. So seems like I'm gonna have to joggle 2 earbuds but the Bose is getting sold"
2024-03-30,"Man, The SoundPEATS ENGINE 4 earbuds ranked all sorts of higher on all fronts compared to these. I mean on the sound dept. Like for different media etc. 

I don't know if I could even spend 300 dollars on earbuds anyways. 

It's pretty shocking."
2024-03-30,"Fair review. I'm looking at Anc and sound. Over priced. I hate it when they overpriced. Quality should come first, but usually big brands tends to command a super high price with so-so quality. To many iPhone is the god standards, but many bads they never tell you. I know of some iPhone users, their phone auto lock... And needs several hours before iPhone will auto unlock. It is crazy.b"
2024-03-30,Hey Gamesky !  Thank you very much!
2024-03-30,They look like they can not be DIY repaired when battery is a gonna xm4 win for me
2024-09-01,Bro is deaf
2024-03-30,"hi big fan, i bought soundpeats truengine se 3 yrs back after watching you review it, still working good"
2024-03-30,the old xm4s have multipoint connect now too thanks to the app update
2024-03-30,i bought 2 xm4 and when i upgraded the software last april they suddenly started overheating and the left earbuds are draining faster that the right. I sent them to Sony service center and theyre charging me 200$ per pair. Really disappointed with Sony
2024-03-30,You're all better off getting the over ear version if you're willing to pay more Has much more longer battery life. Could last you up to all day.
2024-03-30,So the anc is better on the Sony headphones?
2024-12-30,Galaxy buds 3 pro or sony wf1000xm5 ?
2024-03-30,"If you like these.. you've probably never experienced any other ear buds. I had them for a day and then happily returned them. Touch controls were horrible, fit was terrible. Overall, a horrendous experience."
2024-03-30,"Reviews are all over the map on these, both from reviewers and comments.
Glad I don't pay brand tax for earbuds or I'd be confused on these"
2024-03-30,NC on XM5 is at 10% of XM4. You hear everything.
2024-03-30,"Agreed, Sony earbuds doesn't perform well on noise cancellation during calls. Whether its Sony xm4, xm5 or linkbud"
2024-03-30,How do the earfun air pro 3. Do against these sound wise... just want to know..?
2024-03-30,"Its super interesting to me that the microphones on your pair sound much better to me vs. early reviewers whose mics sounded awful, but conversely the ANC was great in their testing but wasnt impressive with yours. Seems like Sony's quality with these is inconsistent in multiple areas!"
2024-03-30,"Appreciate the honesty, useful review as always!"
2024-03-30,"I decide to keep my xm4, and wait for xm6, thank you man!"
2024-03-30,Wich earbuds do you use daily o:?
2024-03-30,Nah..   for the price I'll stick with the Linkbuds S.  Found a new pair for under 100. They sound amazing.
2024-03-30,"Yea the sound sounds confusing, other reviewers are raving about them, guess have to listen myself and if not good will return"
2024-03-30,they used the same battery as the Wf1004 and the linkbuds S
2024-03-30,These are far better than the Bose... The sound stage is much better... the sound is tight and not uncontrolled.
2024-03-30,"I was ready to pull the trigger, but I think I'll wait for soundcore to come out with their x5 killers..lol"
2024-10-31,Wish i had seen this review. Been using xm5 for last 6 months. Not a good experience. Airpods pro 2 were better. I can compromise on some feature but not on ANC and transparency. I use android and still prefer app2. Havent tried bose qc ultra.
2024-07-03,When I shake my head why do I hear a noise
2024-03-30,Epic failure for me don't come close to the previous model XM4. Sent the XM5 model back to get a refund. Gutted was looking forward to receiving these buds but was let down unfortunately.
2024-03-30,""" The XM5s are just not hitting it for me."" - That's what SHE SAID. AYOOOOO"
2024-03-30,"These Xm5s are just LinkBuds S in a new skin with minor improvements. 

Are the Xm5 better than the LinkBuds S when it comes to sound, maybe, maybe not?

Sound quality, past a certain level of quality, is something very subjective.

On the other hand, is there a massive difference in sound quality between them? 

Absolutely not!!! 

Buy the LinkBuds S with memory foam tips, I guarantee you will get the same (almost) level of ANC as on the XM4 / XM5, and especially better microphone in phone call for much less money"
2024-03-30,"Are these the consumer released version

Sony was sending out prototypes"
2024-09-01,I have these and i can say sound is good while ANC is garbage
2024-03-30,What would you suggest for best bass?
2024-03-30,Can it be used on PS5?
2024-03-30,Listen. you have to go out and near traffic to show the call quality. on a bicycle in traffic.
2024-03-30,How do these compare to the technics EAH AZ 80s
2024-03-30,The fact you said you did not have a proper seal in the beginning makes your ANC claim not relevant
2024-03-30,BOSE is still ANC KING.
2024-03-30,"Jeez, Sony seems to be going backwards. I replaced my XM3 with the XM4 last year and was completely disappointed with the sound. To hear that the same issues are still there (no treble...audio sounds dead & flat and less punchy bass). I also went back to office and was disappointed with the NC of people speaking. Now to hear these XM5s are worst at all that and cost even more....it's clearly time to move on from Sony cause the quality is gone to the dogs"
2024-03-30,couldn't disagree more but still well produced content
2024-03-30,finally a review i can trust about the Sony's
2024-03-30,man i most say you do great reviews
2024-03-30,U need Azla sednaearfit to make the work properly in large ears
2024-03-30,For that price it had to have amazing call quality but it does not
2024-03-30,I have to disagree on this one. I couldn’t stand the 4’s but really like the 5’s.
2024-03-30,That happy meal packaging
2024-03-30,At $300 .. and after buying 5 different Sony earbuds over time... im afraid this one will be skipped.
2024-03-30,Video chapter is required
2024-03-30,"I wish I had seen this review before buying a pair. You are spot on, these are really bad. The noise cancelation is just like it does not exist at all. Terrible. I've seen a lot of reviews out there and, now after buying a pair, can't stop feeling that Sony spent a whole lot of budget buying reviews out there. 
Thanks for you honesty! I'm trying to return mine now."
2024-08-02,Sony wf1000xh5 are the best earbuds in the Market!
2024-03-30,"Love the review, still better than AirPods Pro 2 honestly they are disappointing"
2024-03-30,Sony has lost all my respect with the sony wf-1000xm4s. Having had them replaced on 3 serperate occasions for the same battery drain issue. I will not buy the wf-1000xm5s. Plain and simple.
2024-03-30,Totally disagree with him.....i have compared these ones with my bose qc2 earbuds.....sony has done an excellent job!!! Highly recommended!!!
2024-03-30,ultra low latency?
2024-03-30,"Guys, noise canceling is bad. I had linkbuds s  before, and its way better"
2024-03-30,"these earbuds are amazing ur buggin (respectfully)

i usually don't usually listen to music super loud at all so they are loud as HELL. you might have tinnitus LMAO

the OG eartips suck though i had to get Airfoam Pro eartips

bass 'could' be better but i would rather have a balanced sound that prioritizes clarity over bass.

and one more thing, does any earbud reviewer ever think that maybe its not the earbuds that sounds like shit. but the mix and master of the song itself?"
2024-03-30,"Completely agree with your thoughts on the ANC. It's not the best ANC on the market. It seems like the passive noise isolation does most of the work in blocking out sound. To get somewhat functional ANC you need to really plug your ears. The stock tips that fit comfortably in my ears don't get a good enough seal for the ANC to work, forcing me to use tips that are uncomfortable to wear. Not worth $300"
2024-03-30,Very Honest review
2024-03-30,"Wow, I'm very surprise by your review. Honestly, I thought you were a Sony fan. Please to see not that much. Your review is quite hard: medium ANC, medium sound, top price, just like Bose for other reasons. Seems to be a patern here..."
2024-03-30,Ooo so good video . These Sony are great but too expensive.
2024-03-30,A slight upgrade of Sony Linkbuds S
2024-03-30,"Interesting review, pretty opposite to every other review i've watched. I honestly think your hearing is just not fitted for the ANC, because EVERYONE else seems to consider their ANC as the best out there.."
2024-03-30,"so sad about this
thank you for  your honest review"
2024-03-30,Finnaly not a PR video:)
2024-03-30,Appreciate the opinion
2024-03-30,can you please add chapters to your videos
2024-03-30,Man your the only reviewer i watched that had negative review
2024-03-30,I just need some good earphones o I’m getting these
2024-03-30,"Already buy this and for 400 aud this is a bad tws. Why ?

1. For sound quality it is only 10/15% better than moondrop alice which is more than 50% less the price

2. For delay compared to space traveler which is 23 aud this sony xm5 is garbage the delay is one of the worst tws you could find for gaming. While space travelers have almost all modes and no delay at all.

3. Codec this xm5 dont even have APTX which is embarrassing for the price.

The only thing they are proud of is the feature where it could stop music while speaking and ANC which you could find in cheaper TWS.

Not gonna buy flagship products from sony again"
2024-03-30,"This is the only review out of the very many I’ve listened to that has given them a poor rating, I have mine on preorder so time will tell who I believe is correct"
2024-03-30,Man the volume sucks on these !
2024-03-30,I love the honesty !!!
2024-03-30,How does it compare with the Jabra Elite 7 Active as far as secure fit and ANC?
2024-03-30,"Many thanks for another honest review, done in what I consider an easy listening & informative style."
2024-03-30,"I totally agree with your assessment of the ANC. Very disappointing! I am therefore surprised at how many YT reviewers are raving about it. Unless something is wrong with my units, the xm5s are several steps back from their predecessors and competitors on the noise cancellation front."
2024-03-30,Sony Wf-1000xm5 = Sony Wf-100xm4 smaller ver
2024-03-30,I just got them today. Very disappointed. Bass it's far from good. Returning them
2024-03-30,"In the beginning of the video, you said you used silicone ear tips instead of the provided foam ones hence the ANC isn't great(at least for you) and also the bass lacking is because you aren't getting a perfect ear seal. It's really that obvious, man. How can a reviewer not know this??? The provided hybrid foam tips works on almost everyone except a few like you. I suggest you to try out Comply foam tips and recheck the ANC again. And if you still think the ANC is worst than XM4, maybe you are deaf and should stop reviewing audio products."
2024-03-30,"You recommended the XM4 to everyone? Why???? They are pretty much bad at everything, sound quality, ANC is laughable, they are uncomfortable and battery life drops like a stone after a year or so."
2024-03-30,"You look a little under the weather in this video, you alright bud?"
2024-03-30,"No offence but you’re using a silicone eartips which isn’t this earbuds are intended to use with,and you are complaining about the ANC and sound quality and thus in my opinion you are misleading your viewers….."
2024-08-02,"Ok, go watch Flossys review..... Why do all of the reviews on the XM5s contradict each other?"
2024-03-30,No thanks I don't care about these earbuds anymore when you can get shokz openfit open ear is the best kind of earbuds
2024-03-30,I had  the xm5 and linkbud S and jbl live pro 2. I returned the sony. Sound is mediocre..i stayed with jbl.
2024-03-30,"I had the xm4 ... will withhold judgement on xm5 until 1+ years. My xm4 started having bad battery drain and I've heating after 1 year. Sony's reaction to globally documented issue makes me lose trust in Sony as a brand. Will not buy Sony again. I also have the xm3 headphones, cd player, integrated Dolby 7.1 amp, led tv so live time Sony fan boy here ... i won't recommend Sony to anyone"
2024-03-30,"Just purchased the XM5 last week, but my 60$ Oneplus Nord buds 2 sounds better, had to return the XM5.......check sound signature before buying...dont fall for the hype.....Sony's phone app is also a pain in the butt.."
2024-03-30,How are these compared to the Liberty 3 Pro?
2024-03-30,"Yup,,, the ear tip suck!!! Thankfully I have a bunch of SpinFits!!!"
2024-03-30,"You didn’t use the proprietary foam ear tips from a Sony product and seemed to have no idea why sound or ANC would take a hit.. this whole video is simply false. Watch, literally, ANY other review."
2024-03-30,"Sad, I wanted them to be good"
2024-03-30,You’re hit the nail on head with the review especially ear tips why do they miss the big point ear fit is everything confused by Sony. I think last chance saloon for me. Excellent accurate review as always
2024-03-30,Thx as now I am not going buy this one now.
2024-03-30,"Great review,  at $300 I'd expect more than the xm4's but getting less and not as good make these a hard pass for me IMO"
2024-12-30,This review seems a bit flawed.
2024-03-30,No way!!!
2024-03-30,Hell yea
2024-03-30,"Wow  Sony seems to have dropped the ball on the 5. Definitely not getting my money now, but maybe they can be fixed via updates in the app that make the price more appealing."
2024-03-30,
2024-03-30,"Nonsense review ,use the app for eq"
2024-03-30,No good
2024-03-30,Dami mo naman dada
2024-03-30,"I will agree to disagree with almost everything you have said.  It simply boils down to not being able to get a good seal/fit.  You have not been able to get it.  I had.  The sound of these is superb about 3o% better than on M4s and ANC about 20% better than on m4s.  My seal is good w/ stock eartips and even better w/foam ones from a 3rd party manufacturer.  Linkbuds S ia good product, but a battery life is pathetic.  M4 had a mediocre anc and battery issues after 1year and 3 months.  Bose qc2 has the best anc, but pathetic sound signature.  M5 is an all rounder for me and with Android phone and a dedicated sony nw a55 music player is a no brainer!  By the way after 8hrs of contued use with decc extreme and ldac setting playing music, videos, movies it is still at 25%. 
  P.s.: M4 was cumbersome and  uncomfortable.  M5 is so much better-great seal and comfort translates into better sound and. Call  quality."
