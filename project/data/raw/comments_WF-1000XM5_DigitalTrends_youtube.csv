2024-03-30,How does a 12 min review about a sound product only have 4 seconds of reviewing the sound. The sound is literally the most important part
2024-03-30,"I got the XM3, XM4 and now the XM5. They have continued to get better every iteration. All of them still work great so there's always a back up. I've worn them for working out and hiking, they've taken a beating and still awesome."
2024-03-30,"I had the xm4s as well(still do) and just picked up the xm5 yesterday, and can confidently say rhat after extensive listening, the xm5s are much improved in sound details and voice/instrumental separation and clean/clear depth with music.  I am very impressed actually, they sound a fair bit better than my xm4 over ears as well.  This is with Tidal and ldac codec by the way.  Hope this helps with additional description on sound of these earbuds."
2024-03-30,"I went for the Linkbuds S after the XM4. These are a joy to use. Everyday, as soon as I cross the door at work, I put them on and everything is so calming. The way they pack so much in such small earbuds is really impressive
A quick equalization and I have nothing bad to say"
2024-03-30,"I already preordered them. 
The noise cancelling alone is worth it even without listening to anything."
2024-03-30,"Those chime notifications that happen when switching modes can be disabled very quickly on the 1000XM4 earbuds via the software. Flip off the ""Notification and Voice guide"" toggle under system settings. I would be very surprised if Sony deleted this very important feature! Those notifications going off every time the noise canceling software switches modes is very annoying."
2024-03-30,"I am still using my Sony Linkbuds S and it just feels so great. So compact and I believe it is still the lightest wireless earbuds in the market. I never felt any ear strain at all. In fact, I fell asleep while wearing it and removed them when I woke up. No discomfort at all which really surprised me."
2024-03-30,"My order will be delivered by tomorrow, can’t wait to use them.
A little complaint about the case led, the one from xm4 looks much better than xm5’s."
2024-03-30,"The Sony Linkbuds S are so underrated! The noise cancelling is so good and the size and fit are perfect. I had purchased so many earbuds before, looking for the right one, and they are it. I would love to have some XM5s but i'm not in a rush to replace my linkbuds."
2024-03-30,"i had 2 pairs of the XM4s.  The second i got because my first pair was run over and I thought I loved them, but then i lost one of the repalcement XM4s and i couldn't afford a 3rd pair.  So I got the LinkBudS and I actually liked those way more.  The XM4's were uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time and they were heavy, but the LinkBudS were so much lighter and more comfortable to wear for hours at a time.  A few EQ tweaks and I couldn't tell the difference between the Links and the XM4.  This XM5 looks very similar in shape and form factor as the LinkBudS.  So I am curious about these XM5's."
2024-03-30,"Just got these yesterday and I agree with you 100%. Me and you actually have the same use case with TWS. I use the Air Pod Pro 2s as my daily driver with my iPhone. I wanted something with multi connect for work. I have the Linbuds S and I too love them, but wanted more Audiophile quality when I listened to music. Hard to beat the comfort of the Linbuds S and the Air Pod Pros tho. I had the XM4s, but returned them because of size...the XM5s are much better than the 4s. So we will see if I think they are worth the $300 by the end of the week. Then decide if I want to keep them."
2024-03-30,"I'm loving my XM5's. I havent touch my Bose QC2 earbuds since getting my XM5's.

Im surprised how comfortable they are."
2024-03-30,"Why companies so focus on noise cancelling on ear & headphones nowadays and not the main thing we want to enjoy with them which is sound quality? Is it because sound quality can't be improve much so they want to find other things they can continue to improve on each generation to drive more sales? We already immerse ourself into our digital life way too much and forgot to enjoy the nature and get to know new people, why not make new capability and marketing to make that easier to happen and more enjoyable?"
2024-03-30,I have had Sony’s SBH80 bluetooth earphones for years and years and they are still going strong. I will be sad when they eventually fail. Not sure how I would go with these new little buds.
2024-10-01,"I’ve had the headphone version, I think the XM2s for YEARS. And they keep working through dozens of flights and thousands of workouts. Between the airpod pros and the XM5 earbuds I chose these. Sony is just great. 

They SHOULD make an aviation headset though like Bose."
2024-03-30,the review is so calming
2024-03-30,"I bought the Anker Liberty 4 NC hoping it would be a cheaper alternative, but I learned that you really do get what you pay for. The noise cancelling is not even close to the level of Sony. Sound quality was pretty good, but the shape of them hurts my ears. Another thing, the silicon tips suck and you can't get foam tips for them yet. They have a proprietary shape that won't fit generic foam tips from Comply."
2024-03-30,I got these ear buds for my birthday. Also the first decent quality wireless ear buds I’ve ever put in my ear. I’m kinda a Sony fan boy when it comes to audio but I was seriously debating these or some Sennheiser earbuds. Sony won out in the end for me… For now.
2024-03-30,"The AP Pro 2. Transparency, AirTag feature and the seamless switching make it really hard to switch to other brand. I just wish a better sound quality."
2024-03-30,"Does this model FINALLY remove the biggest problem with the XM4: FULL TREBLE DROP after 70%, with muddy hell sound the rest of the way up?"
2024-03-30,"I lost my AirPods Pro 2  , Now I am in a dilemma between Sony xm5 and AirPods Pro 2 (again)."
2024-03-30,"Great review. I have the XM4's, and the 1000XM5 headphones. Needless to say, I love the brand, and I'll more than likely get these earbuds. My concern is the batteries ... my XM4's suffered from the reported battery drain issue, and I'm hesitant to purchase these if they haven't TRULY addressed that problem."
2024-03-30,These look good but I can't justify Sony charging $300 when you can get the more comfortable and nearly same quality Linkbud S for half the price.
2024-03-30,7:18 I thought the AirPods sounded way better
2024-03-30,"It’s funny that you started by saying “would you buy them again if you lost them” as Sony did not add the 1 feature I want. There’s no findmy feature built into the Sony app or compatibility with the iPhone findmy app. I’ve owned 2 pairs of xm3s and currently use xm4s, but when I lose them or they stop working I’m getting AirPods Pro 2"
2024-03-30,When you have an iPhone and you get a call and then open up these earbuds and insert it in your ear does it verbally tell you it’s connected like the M4 does? I hate that.
2024-03-30,what is the pairing like between multiple devices? I think many peeps like me pair our headphones to at least one laptop and mobile. In a perfect world we would be able to pair more but alas. I do find that some buds really dont switch as seamless as they advertise and struggle to do things like listen to music on one device and suddenly taking a call on the other. OR sometimes do things at the same time on both
2024-03-30,I like the Waltz For Debbie LP featured in the background.  Nice to see another Bill Evans fan out there
2024-03-30,The camera mic with background noise sounds way better than either set of buds with NC imo.
2024-03-30,"Hi there, can u pls share the case you are using for your iphone in the video, i like the stand it has for vertical view."
2024-03-30,"I’ve got small ears and these fit my ears nearly perfectly, they do feel a little full, but the audio more than makes up for it!"
2024-03-30,They are great. Unfortunately didn't fix the uneven battery drain though.
2024-03-30,"Just a heads up: If you're not an audiophile these wont be for you. I bought a pair of pixel bud pros, and then these new xm 5. The stock eartips are kind of a pain to keep in. Though the SS eartips did the best job. But these arent exactly intuitive or easy to setup. Im a contractor so im outside and move around a lot. And these just were a pain to get out of the case, or accidentally touch the controls on the buds. The transparency mode was kind of not great, though the anc was good. And also they did horrible in the wind. Also the earbuds charge at seperate rates which was weird. Needless to say I bought a pair of airpods pro 2 and all around its better, cheaper, the transparency rocks and the noise cancelling is great too."
2024-03-30,Would love to get some comparison reviews on ear buds for different types of music. I feel like some brands sound great with certain genres but not to good with others. For example I have some old Bose soundsports that play EDM great but lack when it comes to rock and metal music.
2024-09-01,"I had the very first noise canceling Sony wf… earbuds. I dont remember it was 1 or 2 model. Then I had xm3, xm4 and now xm5. I liked all of them. They are not perfect and sometimes have bugs- ignore the touches and i have to put them back into the case. But the ANC, sound quality, battery life and comfort are outstanding. And the depth of base they can achieve is just impressive. It can hits my ears with base so hard no other large over ear headphones I have can (Bose 700, AKG k712 pro, Beyerdynamic 1990pro)"
2024-03-30,"Honestly, I'm getting those today when I finish work. When I got it I got a lot of settings on my phone 14 pro."
2024-03-30,How did the mics work for you in a crowded environment with a lot of people? I have had some issues with that which other reviewers have noted only mine arent prototype buds.
2024-03-30,"i've just unpacked mine XM5.... first question (i had the same problem with XM4)
How to enable AMBIENT SOUND and stop the music  WITH THE SAME ONE TOUCH ??  sounds so obvious ... (and it works like this with Sennheisers)
(i don't want to keep holding one earbud for a minute if i want to talk more - quick attention mode)"
2024-03-30,I would love to see a comparison of the WF-1000XM4 vs. WF-1000XM5 vs. Linkbuds S.  @Caleb which would you prefer -Linkbuds S or WF-1000XM5?
2024-03-30,"Warning: when wearing only one bud at a time, with ANC on, external/ambient noises sound like they're coming from the opposite direction. I guess that happens with all varieties (makes/models) of earbuds?"
2024-08-02,"Hello!

I bought a Sony WF-1000XM5 2 days ago. My only problem would be that when talking on the phone on the street, the other party often complains that they can't hear me well, they hear a mechanical voice while talking. Is there any way to adjust it?

Thank you!"
2024-03-30,"As usual, great review! Love your channel! Quick question:  How are these for running?"
2024-03-30,Does it still have the wind noise reduction mode to cancel out wind noise when you're outside listening to music?
2024-03-30,After my  current experience with WF-1000M4 battery issues don't think am going for M5
2024-03-30,"If you haven't already, how about the Bose quiet comfort earbuds? TY"
2024-03-30,Why haven't you reviewed the Technics AZ80 or AZ60MK2?
2024-03-30,"Caleb, what iPhone case are you using?  I really like the big circle foldable stand on it.  Thanks!"
2024-03-30,Do these earbuds work with Apple TV like beats or apple earbuds do?
2024-11-30,I had problems with my old Sony XM4s earbuds so I immediately ran out and got Sony XM5s earbuds and don't regret it one bit and yes the nose camping is better on the new ones and I'm liking that Even though the older ones still had pretty good one noise canceling
2024-03-30,"Update to my post:  Found one that did something with the foam inside the little speaker canal. I did that too. It actually worked, did it on my Linkbuds S. Going to try it on the XM4's too. So now it's not happening (so I notice it) and feels ill having them on. This is still a hardware design flaw inside. By removing the foam gently (as it was possible) and pushing it down even further it help to stop the pinging resonance. NOTE: This isn't a permanent fix, since it can move itself again after some time. SONY has to fixed this intern design flaw. If not already with the XM5, then the XM6's.

Someone did a teardown of the buds and said: ""The spring noise is coming from the metallic shield in front of the driver, by pushing them you deny the shield to move and provoke the spring noise.""

My post:
If they still have that annoying hardware issue from the XM4 and Linkbuds S I've bought, this is a NO! When you have low or no sound, you can hit them while they are in your ears (or clapping your teeth together) to hear it. And no firmware has fixed it. I have no trust in Sony anymore after this. Waste of money, but I do love my WH-1000XM4! The WF (XM4) and Linkbuds S is amazing beside that hardware design flaw. But I can't unhear it, and it makes me sick to my stomach hearing that resonance thing or what to call it. The WF-1000XM3 was too big and clumsy, but they didn't had that flaw. After the in-ears XM4 and over to the Linkbuds S they just kept having this annoying flaw. Even got them exchanged, but that didn't help. I know I am not the only one, since I found others on Reddit with the same issue. Also calling it a hardware design flaw making that pinging resonance when you hit them or clapping your teeth. SONY! FIX THIS, NOW! - I don't even bother to try the XM5, because I think it has the same flaw. I love my AirPods Pro (second generation) beside my AirPods 3, since they don't have that flaw."
2024-03-30,"Is it my aluminum hat but I don't seem to be affected by the Sony WF-1000XM5 distortion field. I bought these earphones on day one and they are now lying in a drawer as I don't find a use case where they are better for me. I use the Bose QC 2's for flying, the airpods pro II's for general outdoor use and the Oladance Pro's at work and home. The transparency mode still makes me feel locked in and the notice cancelling is behind both bose and the airpods."
2024-03-30,I wonder what it's like for sports or running . One reviewer said it was problematic .
2024-03-30,Can we connect to Apple tv?
2024-03-30,"So wild! My ears told me that apple sounded better outside and Sony sounded better inside. 
I guess I don't know enough to know why a headset can't sound good both ways"
2024-03-30,"It’s funny how when I watch review videos of the XM5 and AirPod pro 2 headphones it varies as to which one is better.  One person says the Pro 2s are better and someone else will say that the XM5s are better.  It’s so bad that I had to buy them both to determine for myself which ones are better.  Well, it’s no surprise, I love them both!  I wounded how many others out there own both."
2024-03-30,"Caleb, the mic clipped to your shirt sounds better than the sony and apple bluetooth earbuds since it sounds more natural than both sony and apple. I'm using my sennheiser hd 600 connected to the headphone jack on my sony xperia 1 iv android phone to listen to the mic quality comparison with both sony and apple. The sony mic sounds more robotic like your talking under water and the air pods pro mic sounds less robotic but it still has the robotic sound to it. I also have the rode lavalier go mic whenever I use the mic to plug into the headphone jack of my phone. I use a 3.5mm audio splitter to use my wired headphones and my rode lavalier go mic at the same time on my phone from the headphone jack when I'm commuting. I would have consider the rode nth-100 headphones but the reviews about the built quality is what turned off on getting the rode headphones since there is a microphone attachment that you can buy for the rode nth-100 headphones that plugs into the 3.5mm port on the rode headphones. The mics on bluetooth headphones don't sound as good and natural as a real mic that are plugged in from the headphone jack or a dedicated external mic like from rode, sennheiser, akg, neumann, shure etc. I even bought the akg lyra mic for using with android devices from the usb c port, I even used the headphone jack on my akg lyra mic to monitor my audio from my phone. I even use my akg lyra mic for plugging into my laptop for zoom meetings."
2024-03-30,How about a review of the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II ?
2024-03-30,what about training or running with them?
2024-03-30,good to know-how expensive are they/thanks much
2024-03-30,This was a good review. Thank you
2024-03-30,Can you do a comparison video of them vs the Bose QC II Earbuds? Thanks
2024-03-30,"@Digital Trends

Does it have a ""LOST MODE"" Feature?!? I mean if you lost your old Sony earbuds before... The AirPods Pro 2 does."
2024-03-30,Great review ! :)
2024-03-30,do they stay secure during workout? thank you
13  ago,"In March 2025, XM 5 are mid-level overall yet still almost $300! At that price, there are way better options today"
2024-03-30,@DigitalTrends still hoping for a proper video review of the Bang & Olufsen PX7 S2
2024-03-30,"Excellent review, where could I buy your Iphone case with stand? They look practical."
2024-03-30,"Ayyyye, the audio is perfect this time (if a little light on the pizazz) that last video with the wonky audio made me feel like my brain wires were crossed up lol"
2024-03-30,Does those black ones get super visible fingerprints?
2024-03-30,was supposed to collect today but guess what argos screwed up my order getting next day delivery with currys tomz very excited as I lost of of my XM4 bud a few months ago
2024-03-30,"Sound great (after custom EQ). Sadly the tapping options are limited and volume and noise control not as convenient as with the XM4s, which could be set the same on both Left and Right, which was great when wearing one at a time (eg for head on pillow, hearing GF or ""doubling"" battery capacity)."
2025-02-28,Thanks for the excellent review
2024-03-30,"How would you compare sound quality and especially noise cancellation of WF-1000XM5 and WH-1000XM5? Do those even compare? I have WH-1000X3, AirPods Max, AirPods Pro 1 and the Sony are absolute best in noise cancellation followed by Max and far behind are the ear buds AirPods Pro 1. So is there still such a big gap between in ear and over the ear headphones? The price is similar and comfort is better with in the ear I guess. What's your take on this?"
2024-03-30,I lost my last two pairs of Sony link buds s... Looking for an upgrade or the same pair again
2024-03-30,Do these get loud?? I need answers please. How do these stack up to the poeerbeats pro
2024-03-30,"The xm4's sound awesome, but I use the linkbuds s way more these days."
2024-03-30,"Question: 
I have had the XM4 for 3 years now and would you suggest this upgraded  xm5?"
2024-03-30,After this review listening with my xm3's  i'm sure i will upgrade to these xm5 ones. Thanks mate!
2024-03-30,The voice sounds better when you are talking with airpods indeed. Good to know how they function in a work call
2024-03-30,"Hello. Please give me some direction. I want to know which headphones are better in terms of music, bass, quality. I will use them mainly for this. I'm torn between the Sony hm5 and the Bowers & Wilkins pi7. Please, if you have other suggestions, write them."
2024-03-30,"Right now I've got the WH 1000-XM5 (which are the headphones) and I was wondering if the WF's have better sound quality than the WH's. I have a 100 day trial period for my headphones and I'm more of an earbuds person, should I send them back and get the WF'S instead? The only thing I really care about is audio quality so keep that in mind."
2024-03-30,I would go with Senheiser Momentum 3 BUT I see so many complaints of the breaking down every few months. sony seems like more reliable option.
2024-03-30,"The anc is lost after I update the firmware!!!! Anyone know how to fix it!??  Before the update the anc is so impressive, but after the firmware update the anc is obviously weaker than before, I need to double check the anc is on or off because I barely hear any difference now!!!"
2024-03-30,Where is the u7k review???
2024-03-30,Differentiation between the 2 models is WF and WH
2024-09-01,Went to shop yesterday to try headphone version s u cant test earbuds due to hygiene reasons n the anc blew me away. Better than my work earmuffs.
2024-03-30,What’s that iPhone stand? Case?
2024-03-30,The WF is stands for Wireless Free. WH is for wireless headset.
2024-03-30,"Love the xm4, it is hard to justify the $300"
2024-05-04,"Ambient Sound volume is
much too quiet / soft, even
when set to 20 (max).. how to make it louder?"
2024-03-30,"When it comes to fitting inside, I'll go for any Senneiheiser or Beats fit pro."
2024-03-30,Can u do the technics eahaz80 if u havent already.
2024-03-30,Review the Denon Perl Pro
2024-10-31,im the only one feeling dizzy after 5 minutes wearing them? my airpods pro 2 broken and got this and thinking will need to buy again airpods....
2024-03-30,Should have led with the note about other reviews... I thought you were smoking something when you praised the mic performance. Now it makes sense!
2024-03-30,Watching and listening to this on my silver WF-1000XM5 which I got a couple of hours ago
2024-03-30,Plz plz reply tell me which one is more louder I'm really confused Airpods pro 2 vs this one
2024-10-01,There is zero bass with noise canceling off.  You didn’t mention that.
2024-03-30,I'm here because of those Sennheisers shown at the beginning. Damn right ear bud just stopped working. Apparently it's a common problem. While I love Sennheiser over ears I'll be switching to Sony ear buds
2024-03-30,"I'm getting the wf xm4 for around $92... Should I still go with the xm5?? Is it that good? Pls advice 

Also, my phone supports only BT5.2 and not planning to upgrade for another 2 years.


Do sony give updates for xm4 since xm5 is now released?"
2024-03-30,How would these be for working out
2024-03-30,"I think you should reconsider your light placements or intensity of the lights that shine on you. You look a bit washed out in this video. Never had this before. 
Great review by the way."
2024-03-30,"I spend a lot of time studying at the university library, so I bought them because of the active noise cancellation, the portability and the promising sound quality. And honestly, I don't know if it is just my pair of earbuds, but the audio cuts out constantly, and it's fucking annoying.

By day 5 of usage, I started using my old wired (and way cheaper) earphones. Outside of the library the interruptions also occur, but with less frequency. Sony states on its web page that the problem might be due to slow Wi-Fi, but I've tried them with downloaded media turning off the Wi-Fi and they face the same problem. My phone is quite new (a 3-month-old Pixel 7), and testing them with my iPad does not give better results. I think Sony should advertise them as ""unsuitable for crowded environment expensive earbuds"".

Another issue I've faced with these earbuds in the two weeks I've been testing them is that sometimes one of the earbuds won't connect even if the battery is full.

The sound quality is indeed amazing (when the audio isn't randomly interrupted)."
2024-03-30,How is this Sony works with the AAC of iPhones?
2024-03-30,"Hi Caleb, can you seriously mow the lawn with these? Thanks!"
2024-03-30,"I always say the m3, m4, m5 part as mark 3, mark 4 ,mark 5. so, these would be the wf-1000x mark 5"
2024-03-30,How about the between 3 anc
2024-03-30,"Seems very good. One thing i don't like is ""slippery"" gloss finish.
Matte was way better in the XM4 and felt more expensive :D"
2024-03-30,"I have the Sony Linkbuds S. I very much wanted the XM5, but after using the S, I won't. They are very frustrating. They drop out all the time, capacitive touch sucks, a hoodie would trigger it. The app is primitive. The whole experience is disappointing."
2024-03-30,Sony's support of the XM3's turned me off from the brand's earbuds... a security update completely muffled the sound quality while using ANC. Can't flash an old firmware either so they basically became my spares a few months after the XM4's launched. Their XM3 headphones are going strong though.
2024-03-30,"7:00 Hmm the XM5 have quite a drop in quality, especially the treble."
2024-03-30,"sorry to rain on your parade but having the MX4 and now MX5 I find it very disturbing to hear the lound ""THUMP"" sound when walking . Now on MX4 that appeard only while running so I never used them as go-to buds for running with MX5 i can hear the distinctive ""THUMP  THUMP THUMP"" while walking and there is no fix for that . Now I never had this with JBL True earbuds or Jabbra 85t . At this moment I feel I throw $300 out of the window .  I did upgrade to firmware 2.1 and it is the same THUMP,THUMP,THUMP....."
2024-03-30,"Please, with your industry contacts at SONY, tell them they need to offer the spare Beige/ Silver ear tips as spare parts.
This lack of spare tips is so annoying and a disgraceful approach by SONY"
2024-03-30,"I loved the Linkbuds S.  I got the bose earbuds. For their edtreme comfort. But if linkbids had better NC, id get that in a heartbeat"
2024-03-30,Listening to u on my xm5 and u sound Fantastic
2024-03-30,XM5s mic sounds like an audible audiobook recording
2024-03-30,what about gaming and latency?
2024-03-30,"I might buy them. I had XM4s but had battery issues.

However... that battery issue nags at me. Earbuds are basically non-recyclable, non-repairable, consumer products that will stop working after a number of years. Probably less than 5. Maybe even as little as 3. In the case of my XM4s, about 1.5.

I'm almost inclined to just buy wired IEMs again."
2024-10-01,"Just got a pair. Not worth $300. The only reason I haven't returned them is because I'm sick and tired of researching earbuds. They work and I guess that's fine but let me be rightly understood, THEY ARE NOT worth $300. IMO"
2024-03-30,Serious Question.- but are you using these with an iPhone?  because I can tell you.... try them on a good samsung - they will sound CONSIDERABLY better ;)
2024-07-03,"I was watching this with Linkbuds S 
For transparency, I use the original Linkbuds"
2024-03-30,"My story is very similar to his.
I had the XM3. It was stolen. 
I went out and bought the AirPods Pro 2.  Very happy with them, especially since I use an iPhone , iPad and Macbook Pro, and the integration is great. And agreed: nobody can come close to the AirPods transparency mode. 
However, seeing all these reviews on the XM5, and the extra features and improvements on the nit picks I had on the XM3, I'm seriously considering getting the XM5.
I miss the Sony, so I considered getting the LinkBud-S.  But with the introduction of the XM5, I think I'll just plunge and get the top of the line."
2024-03-30,Definitely understand I have the air pro 1 as my everyday with the iPhone and back up is Linkbuds S got brand new for 60$
2024-03-30,"Finally someone concern about form
Factor bulky"
2024-03-30,"I have the sony xm4s and they are my favorite earbuds out of all my headphones, jbl, sennheiser, beats, skull candy, etc. My sonys are my go to fit sound quality and volume, and they have really good battery life also"
2024-03-30,Sony m5 or b&O ?
2024-03-30,Wait… $118 for two potted plants WTH? Not even trees… which produces way more of what we need?
2024-05-04,The wfxm5 are best at anc comfort call quality connection stability and good sound the wfxm3 was the best sounding earbuds i heard yet had that smooth sound with abit more crisp brightness slightly wider sound stage like the aswome sound the whxm4 had aswell like abit more like audiophile sound but they all sound  good still forsure
2024-03-30,"Really nice review with good production values! And happy to see the new, familiar surroundings. I don’t particularly enjoy putting anything in or around my ears, but the XM5 buds certainly seem to tick all the boxes!"
2024-03-30,I got anker souncore life a1 i think they are and they are amazkng never fall out soinds amazing. My kids have aip pods pro 2 and if you did a blind test they sound the same to me
2024-03-30,I like the design of the XM4's more aesthetically
2024-03-30,"i own the WF 1000xm4. they never fixed the widespread battery drain / explode issue, so not sure there is a point to compare XM5. If i didnt own the XM4 & if didn't hear about the XM4 issue / how Sony abandoned most of its customers, especially if outside US., i might be drawn to the smaller / slimmer XM5 and case. BUT, ship sailed. even for myself who has been fanboy since schooling days (walkman, betamax & mini-disc briefly in my uni days) & buying Japan only hi-fi CD players & amps. i loved Sony sound, but it is BOSE now !

be warned (yes i like the custom EQ feature in app but just cannot trust Sony wont make another great product then let it implode / explode after 1 year. esp not at this price point."
2024-03-30,"Not a single mention of the Bose QC2? Widely described as having the best ANC, bar none? Puzzling..."
2024-09-01,"Wait, $115 for 2 small plants? Criminal."
2024-03-30,"I have had the XM3s for a few years now, and the battery life is about half. I know i can replace the batteries in the buds but im looking into how much better the XM5s are"
2024-12-30,"I bought these assuming I'd be able to set the volume control like I had it on the XM4, on the left earbud, one tap to raise, two taps to lower it. It turns out there's no way to do it. Instead, you have to tap 4 times and 5 times. What bonehead at Sony thought this was a good idea? Honestly, how can someone so far up the corporate foodchain be so stupid?"
2024-03-30,I adore my XM4's but I'll skip the XM5 and maybe wait for the XM6
2024-03-30,Anybody have any suggestions for good buds for small ears?
2024-03-30,"Nope! The Jabra 75t, sound better, and cost 1/4 the price. 
I have about 8 pairs of headphones because I keep listening to these reviewers, and rushing out to buy their latest recommendations. 

The Sony's have a few more features, and better battery life than the archaic Jabra 75t's, but for sound quality the Jabras are far ahead, both subjectively and objectively.  

Jabra: louder without distortion. Exceptional bass.
Clearer highs (treble).

Sony: better noise canceling,  more features, twice the battery life. Very good bass, but a different type of bass.

I buy earbuds for music, Jabra excels at this."
2024-03-30,"Ma' boi, where is the samsung s90c review?!!!"
2024-03-30,Naming convention is simple when you add  “WF”
2024-03-30,I think its still hilarious how bad the best wireless earbud/headphone microphones are compared to the cheapest shittiest $2 earbud mic
2024-03-30,Shout-out to the CD =D
2024-03-30,What laptop do you use?
2024-03-30,"Thanks for the review, but I really couldn't keep watching it with the terrible background jazz music."
2024-03-30,"While they are good, they fall short of the B&W Pi7 S2's."
2024-03-30,XM 4 are superb btw
2024-03-30,Watching this after I lost my left Linkbud S :(
2024-03-30,Anybody ever tell you that you sound exactly like Jason Bateman when you talk?
2024-03-30,Crushing are only Skullcandy Crushers.
2024-03-30,Is that ... a CD?... so the legends are true...
2024-03-30,I always enjoy your reviews
2024-03-30,Sony's the best
2024-03-30,"Another junk Sony product . Try the LG t90Q's - the ONLY dolby atmos earbuds out there . Head tracking , ambient , pass thru , and noise canceling also. Thise Sony ones are JUNK compared."
2024-03-30,Do the JLab epic lab edition please
2024-03-30,Somehow the XM5s worked for u but not for me
2024-03-30,"Proper Truman Show moment for me here. Left my XM4s in another city over the weekend and it's been devastating not having them. Ofc I thought, do I just get the XM5s? Or wait two weeks to get them back?

Then along you come with this intro which is tailor-made for me  Here we go then... Do I upgrade?"
2024-03-30,Sony WF 1000xm5 leaves Apple Airpod Pro 2 in rear view mirror way behind
2024-03-30,They hurt my ears. I wish the Bose QCII didn’t have such awful connectivity problems. That’s the only reason I tried the new Sonys. I really hoped they would be the perfect option to fix the issues I didn’t like about the AirPod Pro 2 and the Bose QCII. But none of the great features matter if I can’t stand how they feel in my ears.
2024-03-30,"I still have the first generation :). The battery life is not as good as when they were new, but they are still pretty good. But maybe it is time to replace them for this 5th generation. What a perfect time for that."
2024-03-30,"Not sure on the validity of your reviews... you raved about Sennheiser Momentum 4's   and yes they sound good, but you failed to mention how horribly bug ridden the software and glitches in general are with these.  Mabey you were sponsored by them I don't know..    getting harder and harder to trust you so called reviewers."
2024-03-30,Very profesional.  New sub
2024-03-30,"You should try Samsung galaxy buds pro 2, they are amazing"
2024-03-30,Man's getting hench!
2024-03-30,Where’d you get that little faux plant?
2024-03-30,"These Sonys are so overrated, the Bose QC earbuds 2 blow them out of water. It’s not even close. I tried both the Sony wf4 and wf5 and just thought what??!! How are these even going for $100? No wow factor at all. Noise canceling is great but it comes down to sound and the Sonys sound flat no matter what the EQ settings are and don’t get loud enough. For cheaper solutions that I also found sound much better are OnePlus Pro buds 2 and Soundcore Liberty 4 NC."
2024-12-30,"Everyone beware.... in a crowded place, on a plane, airport, shopping centre etc, these buds are useless even with priority for stable connection turned on. All the bluetooth signals around you will interfere and make using these buds piontless. Sony have gone backwards. My Sony wf700's are far better, cost a 1/3 of the xm5's and do not suffer from external bluetooth interference"
2024-03-30,So my only thought about the call quality is it would have been nice to somehow have a comparison with just your phone as well.
2024-03-30,"They've fixed ANC during calls - on XM5 it is not turns into Transparency mode during calls, but keep ANC on."
2024-03-30,"Wow, why don't you just admit that Sony is paying you to do a commercial for their earbuds? The FACT that you have to tap them four times to change the volume is just pathetic. Nor are they ""class-leading"" in ANC. Many reviewers find their fit uncomfortable after just a few minutes. Almost every review states that the call quality is nothing exceptional. I notice that you didn't play any of the background noise in your review, so that we could hear the actual level of noise they were canceling. 

They are good earbuds, no doubt, but your review comes nowhere near to defining the problems that they have. Like the ""speak to chat"" is easily triggered if you sigh, cough or laugh. Many reviewers won't even use the speak-to-chat mode. And to address your excuse for the many poor reviews these earbuds have doesn't explain why long-term reviews find many faults in them."
2024-03-30,"You look so similar to the guy from ""The Ozarks"" Y'all twins or something?"
2024-03-30,That's why I like neckband bluetooth so I don't lose them
2024-03-30,"BE AWARE! 
If your out of warranty, it will cost you more, to get them repaired, than getting brand new ones... At least in my case with the wf1000 xm4 ️"
2024-03-30,"I returned mine. I upgraded from the XM4's but the XM5's wouldn't stay in my ears with any of the tips proved nor 3rd party tips. Also when comparing side by side, the noise cancelling seems about the same. Couldn't tell any difference."
2024-03-30,It’s rude to talk to someone with earbuds in just take it out put it in your pocket have the conversation and then put them in. I’m sure the chime can be turned off in the app
2024-03-30,Good Job ...
2024-03-30,"Uh I lost my Linkbuds S boo hoo, the xm4 were too big..."
2024-03-30,when is your Dolby vision TV vs samsung TV video coming out?
2024-03-30,technics az80
2024-03-30,"Never buying sony earbuds, their after sales service sucks."
2024-03-30,mw3 beats all...
2024-03-30,Bose
2024-03-30,$300  They're earbuds!! They can only sound so good. It's physics. Size does matter. Keep paying this much and they'll just get more expensive. Unless these sound like a concert hall and are so comfortable you forget you have them they mught be worth half.
2024-03-30,Hi. Is it worth the change from xm4s?
2024-03-30,"Does anyone know how I put my new pair of Sony WF-1000XM5 in pairing mode? I used to hold both sensors for around 5 seconds on my WF-1000XM4, but this does not work on my XM5s."
2024-03-30,"Talking Way to long regarding your ear bud lost stories , just wanted the review"
2024-03-30,anyone else feel like the airpods pro2's call quality was just straight up better? This is a bummer because I want to buy the sony's and am an android user lol
2024-03-30,@09:58 You know what there are more annoying things in life ha ha
2024-03-30,"""Crushing""?"
2024-03-30,Replace your smokealarm batteries before recording a vid on audio equipment. Jesus christ
2024-03-30,"The Headphones app is garbage, can’t believe they have this stupid LOw BaTTERY alert not once, but four times, one per ear. People use these to sleep! God these companies are so stupid… just adding a setting is too challenging"
2024-03-30,I suggest Bang & Olufsen. Sound quality is INSANE!
2024-03-30,AirPods 2 sound more natural for calls in all situations.
2024-03-30,"I must habe gotten a crap pair. I returned it as the earbuds were not as good at the 4s.   When ever i walked it go some kind of noise though the earbuds.  

These earbuds are pretty impressive vs the last version"
2024-03-30,Wow. XM5 sound terrible.
2024-03-30,Dude this is bad.. I almost unsubscribed
2024-03-30,Used both 1000XM earbud and headphone. Headphone rules!
2024-03-30,"Sony FTW all the way, apple can never compete with Sony, period."
2024-03-30,"finally decent brand released real BT headsets with LE Audio profiles
not all of them, but at least started.
There is still no some important ones according to Sony website spec.
No MICP, that allows to control mic separately, and no ugly switching over over profiles when you receive a call."
2024-03-30,"If you exercise, you're going to need another set of earbuds. These are likely not going to be your only earbuds. Their fit is not secure enough for workouts and running in these is absolutely absurd. An IPX4 rating is unacceptable.

I had the XM4 and though the software and audio were great, the fit, size, and IP rating were deal-breakers.


I use the Galaxy Buds Pro for the gym and Beoplay EX for everything else. If i had to pick between the last-gen Galaxy Buds and these Sony esrbuds, id pick the Samsung even though they have no multipoint because they fit so much better and are a dream for workouts.

If these Sony are your only earbuds, you might be too sedentary as they're just horrible for working out."
2024-03-30,Sennheiser
2024-06-03,Lies
2024-03-30,Returned mine. Wonky and unreliable when connected to my iPhone. But sound quality was pretty good. Freaking things just wouldn’t stay connected to phone.
2024-03-30,XM5 is amazing and i listen music while sleeping and you almost cannot feel the earbuds are in our ears.
2024-03-30,Comparing Apple earphones picked up on apple phone with Sony earphoned on Apple phone? That's not a good methodology at all
2024-03-30,“In the most simplest of terms….”  Are double positives always associated with simplicity?
2024-03-30,Bring back button control on earphones and headphones. The gimmick of touch is so overrated in all ways
2024-03-30,Yeah I'm staying away after the battery and firmware issues of the xm4.
2024-03-30,"I'll pass. For me, they need wings so they stay in during workouts and need to be slimmed down. They're still too bulky."
2024-03-30,Buddy lost a lot of weight since the last time I saw him. Good job!
2024-03-30,The Apple air pods sound better to me in this video.
2024-03-30,You are very wrong... Perfect audio with your BIG ears! LOL
2024-03-30,"Come on Samsung, borrow this technology, and find a way to add foam wingtip back"
2024-03-30,"How SONY got a name for its earbuds
Sony (to the team): ""Hey what do you think we should call our wireless earbuds
Team: ""What the fuck!!""
Sony: ""Alright we'll just go with ""WF"""
2024-03-30,Yet another channel with a dude wearing apple watch uses  iphone..... No thank you  Next pls
2024-03-30,Bluetooth EMF cooks your brain.  Get wired earbuds while you still can.
2024-03-30,"Buds sound much better tbh, Sonys sound dull"
