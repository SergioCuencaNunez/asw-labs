2025-02-19,"Dissapointing. 

  
If it had magsafe and was £100 less, id be ordering it asap.

  
I just hope that people will trade in some 13 minis so i can get one on the refurb store. (I want to get apple care so that I can rock it forever.)"
2025-02-19,A bit disappointed that it doesn’t support Qi2/Magsafe.  I was really hoping that it would become ubiquitous/universal within the next 5 years.
2025-02-19,"Why did I feel the whole show was just telling us what any modern Phone could do

Edit: spelling"
2025-02-19,$599 or €719 in Europe is way too expensive.
2025-02-19,"Same as all recent tech: too expensive when the US economy is about to collapse. Thought about doing a 3070 to 5070 Ti but same boat. Can’t afford or justify a $600 price difference between the cards.

Was planning on upgrading from an SE Gen 2 but now I’m holding onto it. Might even just do a battery swap in the coming months."
2025-02-19,"Not very useful. No MagSafe really is a downside.

I was looking for a new business phone. It is now an SE but I find the screen too small (bought because of the price). For this amount of money that the 16e will cost here I will just get an iPhone 15. The AI ​​does not interest me at all and the CPU's in the 'older' iPhones are more than fast enough to have no problems for years. For me it should have been a iPhone mini like before with some updated specs (and with MagSafe) and much much cheaper than this."
2025-02-19,[removed]
2025-02-19,Currently using the 13 should i upgrade to 16e or it's going to be a downgrade?
2025-02-19,"Not bothered by the lack of magsafe like some, but I don't understand why wouldn't you just buy the 15? It's the same price but a better phone. Weird."
2025-02-20,"In a pure Apple to Apple comparison it is a great deal it drops the 2 cameras for a much better single one, +2GB RAM, A15 -> A18, more battery, theoretically better modem, against the iPhone 14 it replaces."
2025-02-20,"As an actual customer who is currently in the market to replace an iPhone with a new one, this phone is *entirely* disappointing.

It’s priced incredibly poorly and features that matter are cut, and the price point makes buying a “real” iPhone that’s not intentionally zoinked for 100 bucks less a no brainer.

For me, this is a *disappointing failure*. 

Honestly it looks like a product launch designed by an MBA — this totally lacks Apple magic."
2025-02-19,"This is not an SE replacement.

Its essentially just a regular Iphone 16 without the ultrawide camera, magsafe, slightly dimmer display, and one less gpu core for $100 less.

I really dont understands apples play here. The whole point of the SE phones was to have a cheap entryway into the apple ecosystem, which is especially important for parents buying their kids phones, grand parents, low income families, emerging markets, etc.

It doesnt need an OLED display, it doesnt need the A18 chip, hell it doesnt even need to be made out of metal. Cutting all of those things I could easily see them bringing it down to $550 which would have been WAYY more attractive.

At $100 less than a basic iphone 16 might as well just spend the extra $100 for the better display/camera system, not to mention people love magsafe."
2025-02-19,ist this expensive?
2025-02-19,I want one as my company phone. Can‘t stand that SE 3….
2025-02-19,"At least 200€ too expensive and the missing features have the typical “Apple is bullying you for being poor” vibe.
No magsafe, no dynamic island and no U2 chip: all things that will annoyingly inconvenience the user and clearly show everyone else that you have the inferior model phone"
2025-02-20,"Apple seem to have forgotten the point of the ""budget"" iPhone.  This thing should have been priced at 499 and then I'd consider it.  I won't consider it at 599."
2025-02-19,"In denmark its 100€ cheaper than the 16. 

Should have magsafe and be 100$ cheaper. Then i would have order it instant. - dissapointed"
2025-02-19,"The only reason I would buy it is if wanted more storage for cheaper :  
With the 16e you can have double the storage compared to the 16 but for the same (or less) money"
2025-02-19,"It’s not an SE replacement, and that’s what I was hoping for. This is way too big for people who prefer the small size of SE."
2025-02-19,The 14 still works fine
2025-02-19,E? man i missed when Apple did Diesel Phones smh
2025-02-19,"Am i imagining things, or apple never advertised quantity of megapixels before? I wasn't following them, but i had this impression"
2025-02-19,"All that the non techy people (and businesses) will see is a new iPhone that is $200 cheaper than the current iPhone, so it'll sell like hotcakes."
2025-02-19,makes the iphone 15 look much more appealing
2025-02-19,I wish it was cheaper. But it does have the action buttons. My iPhone 12 is cheaper and just the better option
2025-02-20,"Who the fuck comes up with the awful music and transitions? 

I love my iPhone but damn, just tell me about the new one and move on."
2025-02-20,It’s in weird spot. It’s not a budget phone but it’s missing features that phone that costs $1000AUD should have.
2025-02-20,"Disappointing device for multiple reasons:

Price is too high for what has usually been a good entry level phone. 
Magsafe: if you need it then fine but not a deal breaker…BUT given Apple came up with it and added the magnets to the Qi2 spec after joining the Qi consortium, you’d think it would be on every damn iPhone
It absolutely should have an OLED screen but that doesn’t justify the price
Same for the processor, the SE always had the latest cpu so that doesn’t justify the price bump here
Camera will be fine. It’ll do…not expecting Pro level photos from this device. 
Given that a lot of this will be from the Apple parts bin, there’s no reason to price it so high unless you’re just trying to recoup the AI R&D budget…this should be at most a $500 starting price but $450 would be better and would sell way more too. 

But what do I know…"
2025-02-20,Why the fuck is the video 13 minutes long for just one product?
2025-02-20,honestly this is the phone that ill probably buy after being on the XR for 6 years
2025-02-20,"Nowhere do they mention that the screen is still only 60fps. Meanwhile, OLED 120 fps screens are common on Android devices costing hundreds less.

As to Magsafe, you can use a Magsafe case to gain back that functionality. The lack of mmWave 5G was expected, it's unlikely that the first Apple modem supports mmWave."
2025-02-20,They really comparing it with iPhone 11 on their website 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
2025-02-20,"If you are someone who uses their phones casually... for tap to pay, whatsapp, calls, basic web browsing, online shopping... you're better off getting one/two generation older iphone or some samsung FE phone."
2025-02-20,I don't buy Iphone so I don't have an opinion about it.
2025-02-20,"The iPhone 16e isn’t a bad phone… it’s a bad value. 

Since 2016, Apple has been giving us the iPhone SE, a $399 parts binned iPhone to get the android users into the Apple ecosystem. The issue at time was that since it was a parts binned phone, it looked dated even though it had their fastest SOC of that time in it. It was a great budget offering by Apple to be a gateway device into the Apple Ecosystem. Further they increased the price of the iPhone SE3 to $429 in 2022. No Biggie.

With the launch of the iPhone 16e, the “SUCCESSOR” of the iPhone SE series, Apple lost the game big time. First, they killed both the iPhone SE series and the iPhone 14 series and positioned (price-wise) the iPhone 16e at $599 which was the price of the iPhone 14 a day before. With the removal of the iPhone SE series the entry price to the Apple ecosystem starts at $599. 

Now starting at $599 isn’t a bad thing at all, the issue is that Apple is giving it a bad value. Apple has positioned the iPhone 16e as a Price Anchor just to make the value of the iPhone 15 series and iPhone 16 series that much more attractive. Apple wants us to compare it with the iPhone SE, but it’s true comparison should be with the iPhone 14 which the iPhone 16e is a Price Replacement of. Comparison with the iPhone 14: 
* No MagSafe
* No Ultrawide Camera
* No Macro Photography
* No Cinematic Mode
* No Action Mode
* No Sensor Shift Optical Image Stabilization
* 1 less GPU core
* No 15 Watt Wireless charging
* No Ultra Wideband Chip
* No Millimeter Wave 5G bands supported
* No Color Options other that Black or White
* Has A18 SOC
* Has USB Type-C
* Has Action Button
* Has A18 SOC

Comparison with the iPhone 15 (+$100): 
* No MagSafe
* No Ultrawide Camera
* No Macro Photography
* No Cinematic Mode
* No Action Mode
* No Sensor Shift Optical Image Stabilization
* 1 less GPU core
* No 15 Watt Wireless charging
* No Ultra Wideband Chip
* No Millimeter Wave 5G bands supported
* No Color Options other that Black or White
* Lower Max Brightness
* No Wifi 7 Support
* No Dynamic Island
* No Threads Networking Support
* Has A18 SOC

Comparison with the iPhone 16 (+$200): 
* No MagSafe
* No Ultrawide Camera
* No Macro Photography
* No Cinematic Mode
* No Action Mode
* No Sensor Shift Optical Image Stabilization
* 1 less GPU core
* No 15 Watt Wireless charging
* No Ultra Wideband Chip

* Higher Minimum Brightness
* No Spacial Photo/Video
* Last Generation Ceramic Shield.

Now with these comparisons out of the way, the iPhone 16e isn’t looking too good especially which kept against the iPhone 14 that it’s directly replacing in terms of price. The iPhone 15 at $699, which is $100 more than the iPhone 16e looks really tempting while keeping in mind the it being a 18 month old phone comes with Apple’s A16 SOC compared to iPhone 16e’s A18 SOC and No Apple Intelligence Features. It further looks even more appealing when compared against the iPhone 16 at $799, a $200 price jump. You for sure are getting a lot for $200 more.The iPhone 16e is in no way a BAD PHONE, it’s NOT a phone that no one should buy, it’s just a terrible value. There have been a lot of corners cut to make it a distinct downgrade from the iPhone 16 and the price hasn’t come down accordingly. This exact same phone at $499 would have been an excellent deal and Apple would have had another Mac Mini M4 moment. At $599, it just too expensive for the amount of features missing. On a brighter note, It might have the longest battery life amongst the iPhone 16 series.Would I recommend the iPhone 16e? For most people, No! It’s absolutely not worth it. However I would recommend this iPhone for the elders in your family, the people who need longer battery life, longer support life with software updates, for those who have gotten used to iOS and who use an iPhone only for FaceTime or iMessages and would find it hard to migrate to Android. To everyone else, It’s just not worth it. If you’re on a tight budget and absolutely need an iPhone, I would highly recommend that you check third-party stores, as they’ll be clearing out their iPhone 14 series stock and maybe you could get it at an even cheaper price. For the rest of you who need an upgrade or a new iPhone, (I can’t believe Apple’s price Anchor strategy is working here) I suggest you save a little more and go for the iPhone 16, It’s a way better deal as compared to the iPhone 16e.

Finally I’ll end with a prediction, The next iPhone in Apple’s ‘e’ series, presumably iPhone 17e would come back to earth with it’s pricing to $499, and Apple is gonna use it a selling point. “Apple’s Most Affordable iPhone, Now Even Cheaper” or something cheesy like that."
2025-02-20,"It would have been interesting, if it were cheaper. I was thinking of going from the iPhone 11 to the 16e, but at this price I rather get a used 15."
2025-02-20,"Maybe I’m being stupid, but this doesn’t feel like much of an incentive to upgrade my 12 Pro Max, or even my girlfriend’s 12."
2025-02-20,"overpriced af. for that price i can get a MUCH better phone. especially in europe, its 699€."
2025-02-20,"Dude Apple , this is bad, the phone is badly prised for that price i would get a new Iphone 15"
2025-02-20,"I really dig the camera though. Even if most doesn't.

I don't want a stupid bulge on the back like them android phones. Will consider this one after hearing the trade in options"
2025-02-20,"Waaaay too expensive for the ""cheap option"" and no magsafe is crazy. The rest I'm fine with."
2025-02-20,"I could forgive everything if it included MagSafe. Without it, it is a horrible value at $599"
2025-02-20,Just get the iPhone 15 for 100$ more.
2025-02-20,"The iPhone 16e is weird. Same price the iPhone 14, which it replaced. But, It lacks some features the iPhone 14 had, such as MagSafe (16e has wireless charging still, but at a slower 7.5W instead of 15W), cinematic mode, and action mode. It loses the .5 ultra wide, but gets a better main camera. 

The stuff it has over the iPhone 14 is the action button, better battery life, and a better chip, albeit with 1 less GPU core than the a18 and a15 the iPhone 14 had. It also has some noise reduction and audio mix features that came with the iPhone 16. 

It is also way more expensive than the iPhone SE which also got removed. 

Would have been cool if they had a mini 16e option for $499."
2025-02-20,"I feel like it should be 450 bucks, or at least 499. Considering its only 100 dollars more to get a better phone with more features"
2025-02-21,Just buy a secondhand iPhone 13 Pro or 15 Pro or something in between those at that point lmao. Better to have an older flagship than an overpriced new phone stripped of most features
2025-02-21,I think the E is for Elderly
2025-02-21,basically a rebranded iphone 14 with ai
2025-02-22,Very disappointing.
2025-02-23,"Coming from a SE ‘22, I wish I got the iPhone 13 mini. I got a iPhone 13 that I still haven’t opened. I have no desire for the 16e"
2025-02-23,Still on my iPhone SE and I’ll probably buy it purely for USBC without spending thousands of AUD at last
2025-02-23,"Why not make a 17e? Top of the line, updated, accessible for people who don't need too much, fresh release or even pre-release to get everyone excited for the iphone 17 lineup at the end of the year because we know it won't have more capability than a 16 anyways. Seems like silly marketing and it's still much larger than a mini so I already know people who won't bother to upgrade. That's Apple though haha"
2025-02-23,"I think the issue with this phone is the comparison to the iPhone SE.

Everyone was expecting a $400 cheap iPhone SE. Instead, they released a more premium phone.

Honestly this is the Phone 99% of consumer should actually purchase. It still blows my mind that their Pro series I phones are the most popular iPhone SKU's. 

I am due for a phone upgrade, and this might be what I go with. My only apprehension is the new modem. I want to see actual testing to know if it is worth spending an extra $200 for a base iPhone 16."
2025-02-24,"I kinda want it. MagSafe would be cool. But more
Importantly: how’s the camera? What’s the widest and telephoto?"
2025-02-28,iPhone 14 seems it’s the best value phone in the apple lineup now. 16e is expensive. Would have made more sense if it were about $ 100 cheaper.
2025-03-02,"If the “e” versions will replace the iPhone SE, then I’m so sad there will be no more Touch ID options for the iPhone. 

I love the UI of the iPhone, but no Touch ID is a deal-breaker. I switched from iPhone XS to SE for the touch ID.

So, looking at the Google Pixel now, for my next phone."
2025-03-04,"I think they missed price good with this one,but even with apple price is variable if the sale us low,so this 599 can soon easily become 399"
2025-03-05,"I got one. I was looking to replace my 2022 SE and the timing worked out.

For someone like me who uses it for streaming videos, calls, texts, navigation, and occasionally delta emulator it’s everything I need. I wish it were 499 but I’m happy with it. For those less inept than I, you may want an upgrade"
2025-03-06,"I just got my phone and was surprised over how tiny it was, had an iPhone 11 before"
2025-03-09,"I like mine. I just upgraded from the SE2, so I had a basically 5-year-old phone.

The 16e is a *huge* improvement in pretty much every conceivable way. It's great. As for the stuff they cut: I don't own MagSafe accessories anyway; the screen is still way bigger, sharper, and now OLED (notch or not); and the single camera uses a larger, more modern sensor, not to mention the integrated second piece for proper optical telephotos (2x, but I like to zoom in!). 

If you adjust the $400 price tag from 2020 for inflation, it's $488 today. I basically paid an extra $112 now than I did then, and that $112 goes a long, long way here. It's a good value, and a perfectly fine iPhone for 90% of people."
2025-03-10,"I think if it was replaced with two cameras, I would buy it."
2025-03-13,not worth it.
2025-03-16,"I like the one camera, I love a great camera in phones, but also I hate the huge bulks that cameras are in phones"
2025-02-19,RIP iPhone SE
2025-02-19,"Too expensive, should be $499 or $529 at most."
2025-02-19,It’s 250€ less than the 16 and 150€ less than the 15 here in Germany. You get a case anyway so MagSafe is not that big of a problem… it’s pretty much the perfect give it to your mom or grand parents phone
2025-02-19,"Well I know which iPhone to buy my mom next. 

But I do think the price breaks the illusion of this phone being a good buy. I’m also not convinced an Aluminium body was the right call - stainless steel would be more durable? I think the camera is enough. The ultra wide camera is a gimmick in my opinion - I’ve rarely used it in any photo I’ve taken in the last 4 years. I think this is apples attempt at forcing adoption of AI to normal users. Half the video felt like an add for “apple intelligence” which I’ve rarely used.

I feel a little bit of buyers remorse though. I bought a 16 pro as a graduation gift for myself when I got my job out of uni. I’ve never owned a flagship phone (I’ll list my entire phone history below) and I’ve been surprised that the flagship does just the same stuff as my old iPhone 12 mini. In fact the only gripe I had with the mini was the battery life and screen size being too small. The battery would see me through half a day with Spotify and messaging apps being used. I like to use Apple Log and tinker with the color in Davinci but this felt like an expensive mistake.

My phone resume from the last 10 years:
HTC 510
OnePlus 2
iPhone 6s
Samsung A23S
iPhone 12 Mini"
2025-02-19,Calling it 16e really makes me think they are not understanding what the market was for the original SE.
2025-02-19,Apple seem so desperate to dilute the iPhone brand. All these cheaper versions push up the price of the pro which was basically the standard iPhone of yesteryear. I’ve had apple devices for the last 7 years but I’m struggling to see what they are actually offering here
2025-02-20,"What a disappointment and a dealbreaker for me as well. I have been waiting for 5 years since I bought my iPhone SE 2020 to upgrade to a new cheaper iPhone with a U1 Ultra Wideband chip so I could finally get maximum usage out of ma Apple AirTags, and now again nothing. Sad."
2025-02-19,Lame. I’ll keep my 14 pro as my main and the s25 ultra as my backup.
2025-02-19,"$170 more than 3rd gen SE($430),  absolutely ridiculous and put me off. $480-500 I would consider might as well wait for the 17 nothing appealing about at all"
2025-02-19,"Tim Cook is cheap and hates making quality products. 

Really disappointing if I’m being honest. No Ultra wide band, no MagSafe. And that price? Woof."
2025-02-19,About $100-$200 too expensive.
2025-02-19,What a terrible choice they made. Getting sick of apple making trash and selling it at an unjustifiable price.
2025-02-19,[deleted]
2025-02-19,"Looks like Apple is trying to rebrand the SE lineup without the ""S"" stigma 😂. If you watched the keynote, they were extra careful in positioning it for the masses rather than their usual flagship-class approach. Honestly, they could’ve gone with **16R**—the **10R(XR)** was a huge success after all.

That said, this feels like Apple filling a market gap, especially with how many people in the US are picking up Google Pixels just because they come with the cheapest carrier plans. Wouldn’t be surprised if they’re reusing iPhone 13 panels and production lines, considering how much they’ve invested in India and other manufacturing locations.

**But the lack of MagSafe is a dealbreaker.** It’s 2025—MagSafe has been around for years, and at this point, it's an essential feature for accessories, charging, and overall convenience. Cutting it out just to differentiate from the flagship models feels like an artificial limitation rather than a cost-saving move.

**TL;DR:** Apple is rebranding SE without the ""S,"" likely repurposing iPhone 13 parts for a mass-market device. Makes sense given Pixel’s dominance in budget carrier plans. But no **MagSafe in 2025? Huge L.**"
2025-02-20,719 Euros for the cheapest model is too much. I can get a brand-new iPhone 15 for that price and the iPhone 16 is only 90 Euros more!
2025-02-20,It is a stripped down 16 that is an entry level iPhone and not a budget iPhone.  They are taking away a category that they did well in
2025-02-20,"Uh an absolute waste of time and money for whoever buys it.

An obvious marketing ploy to pry the older iPhone users away from their phones. 

Literally ripping features out of the phones it's trying to replace and offering AI as the compromise is fucking disgusting.

No phone should come out at that price and come with a single camera. The 2 in 1 claim is bullshit and doesn't remotely understand how cameras work. If they'd made a camera that could actually do that, then they'd whack that shit into their top tier models and be Kings of the world. As it stands, it's marketing bullshit."
2025-02-20,"My thoughts are bad. It's just a waste. Sadly, way too many people are uneducated, so they don't know that they're voting for crap when they pull out their wallets. The US, at least, badly needs genuine education :/"
2025-02-20,"This seems pointless, sure there’s a hardware upgrade, but the price is wayyyy too much compared to the SE."
2025-02-20,No magsafe and it costs more than I thought it would
2025-02-20,"garbage, a piece of last gen tech

at this point all budget samsung phones can beat it lol"
2025-02-20,Stop buying American products! The assholes won't learn any other way.
2025-02-19,"Didn't hear them say anything about the refresh rate of the screen. My assumption therefore is that it doesn't do 120hz, which is a deal breaker for me. Other than that it would fit all of my needs."
2025-02-19,Should’ve had MagSafe and been $499
2025-02-20,"Total rip off. People were losing their minds at the price of the iPhone 7 being $1000 (AUD, 650 US) and that was a flagship. Now their budget line costs the price of a flagship. Absolute rubbish.

Hold onto your devices for as long as possible. It is the only way to get any value these days."
2025-02-19,who cares
2025-02-19,What’s so good about MagSafe? (My phone supports it I’ve just never seen a use I could justify)
2025-02-20,I have a 13 mini and I fucking love it. So glad I got a mini. They need to bring smaller phones back.
2025-02-19,totally agree im looking to upgrade i was hoping it would have magsafe and such
2025-02-19,"I have a 13 mini 128Gb blue with AppleCare+ until September 2025, if you are interested in buying it. It’s always been a secondary device, and I keep thinking of trading it in but I hate the thought of turning in a device that looks this good and has AC+."
2025-02-20,Careful what you wish for. Many of those trade ins just wind up getting recycled. Keeps people buying new and helps with companies goals of being carbon neutral because look at all the stuff they recycle by weight.
2025-02-20,"the apple refurb store has some 13 minis in the UK for £379 ~$479 and i think its a great deal considering it has warranty, a brand new chassis and battery…"
2025-02-21,"There is clearly a market for smaller iPhones. I am willing to pay more for a smaller NEW iPhone, like a 17 mini. Not sure why Apple does not launch a smaller phone even in limited quantity to cater to the customer base that really do not like a big phone. Strategically, I do realize they have no reason to do that, cause their competition is not doing it either, hence they know we have nowhere else to go. But, maybe in an alternate world they would consider this, just to make a small yet loyal customer base happy."
2025-02-19,No reason you can't slap on a case with magsafe in it. You won't get the full charging speed but you'll at least get magnetic alignment.
2025-02-19,They’re trying to convince owners of older iPhones to upgrade.
2025-02-19,"Right? What a waste of time

It should basically have been the last minute and a half"
2025-02-19,Is that like a phone from Mordor?
2025-02-20,Because for the most part all modern phones do pretty much the same thing. Just in different flavours.
2025-02-19,"wow, i paid 600 for the 256gb s24. Thats sooo not worth it."
2025-02-22,"If you’re in Europe just go for the iPhone 16. You can find small local electronic stores that import them and it costs around 750€-800€, way less than buying from Apple directly."
2025-03-10,For whatever reason in estonia you won't find one under 740 euro
2025-02-20,Wait the US economy is about to collapse?
2025-02-21,"I am also trying to upgrade from a 2020 SE 2nd Gen. After 5 years we deserve a better budget option to stay in the Apple ecosystem. Now I'm looking at Oneplus, but I don't want to switch because I have a Macbook too, but I am not paying $900 CAD for a phone anytime soon."
2025-02-19,">No uwb for airtags

Explain?"
2025-02-19,Jank radio?
2025-02-20,"Just update your battery if you don’t need Apple Intelligence, you’ll be fine for a couple of years."
2025-02-20,"Seems that the 16e has the same body and screen as the 13. The only new thing you would be getting is the A18 chip, but you would also loose MagSafe and your ultra wide camera (and someone in the thread said you will also loose uwp) so in many ways you will be downgrading too. I would keep the 13."
2025-02-20,"If you trade in your 13 you can get up to 300 bucks discount, so in you case it might be worth it."
2025-02-22,It should surely not be a downgrade. Because iPhone 16e has USB-C and Apple Intelligence. It’s future-proof and modern. iPhones previous to iPhone 15 Pro feel outdated now as they don’t have Apple Intelligence and USB-C.
2025-02-19,"If your 13 is working properly I wouldn't upgrade to this. Some things might be an upgrade, but others seem a wash or a downgrade.

That's before getting into the pricing."
2025-02-19,"I was considering upgrading from my 14 Pro to the 16e lmao, but the lack of MagSafe and UWB (Ultra Wideband chip) are dealbreakers for me."
2025-02-19,at least in canada it is $100 cheaper than the 15
2025-02-22,It has no apple intelligence.
2025-03-10,"Just to clarify, you’re saying the 16e has a better camera than the 16 pro or a different phone?  Sorry if it’s a stupid question. 

Regardless, how would you say the 16e camera compares to the 16 or 16 pro?

And for fun, how does the 16e camera compare to, say, an iPhone 7 camera?  Thx!"
2025-02-19,No? It’s $200 less (600 vs 800). I would not want to cut out all the stuff you mentioned for $50 of savings.
2025-02-19,">At $100 less than a basic iphone 16 might as well just spend the extra $100 for the better display/camera system, not to mention people love magsafe.

Perhaps Apple identified a signifant group that is unwilling to spend iPhone 16 money, but who can afford a 16e, something along the lines of the touchscreen Airpod being an affordable entry level, popular amongst young teenagers, but I agree that the price difference seems to be too minor for everything that's cut.

I also have trouble seeing how this doesn't eat into the sales of last gen or second to last gen phones that Apple likes to sell. Are they halting that practice? There seems to much overlapping products competing for the same purchases, with the less expensive end being wholly neglected."
2025-02-20,"I agree. I would've liked them to come out with something more in line with the SE2022 using older parts if it meant keeping the prices down. it'd leap the SE 2022 just and still keep the casual user. 

My understanding is, a lot of the reason they even sold the SE in the first place was because they were loosing casual phone users who didn't want to pay big dollars for flag ship phones. Users who paid 30% tariffs on everything they bought through in app purcahses..like candy crush, idk. The 16e will be priced at $1000aud here. A jump from the $700 of the SE2022 which shouldve been like $400aud but I could front up that extra to stay in the apple eco system for convience. Apple are pretty calculating. I can only assume they concluded they didn't need the casual users money..risky move share price wise imo."
2025-02-19,"I'd say it's similar to the A35, which can be had for under 300 bucks. Maybe a slightly faster chip, which makes a comparison a bit harder. But you can't pull the S23fe in this because it's got wireless charging, both ways, and could still be had for 100 bucks less."
2025-02-19,That’s odd… it’s 250€ less than the 16 here in Germany
2025-02-22,"The SE was never a small phone, it was a cheap phone using an older design which just ended up being smaller.  The 16e follows the same logic as the SE, but is overpriced."
2025-02-21,bc they stick with 20 MP and very good optimisation before. Now (last 2 years) they are doing what samsung is doing. MP itself is not important that much but i guess it is good for marketing.
2025-02-23,I bought my grandma one. Cause she’s on the XR. And I know this 16e will last her years
2025-03-03,Ehhhh.... The chipset used in the iPhone 16e is a rocket. None of the budget Samsung phones can come close. And it feels super bad to spend over 500€ on a Samsung A56. You may as well get the IPhone 16e.
2025-02-19,The regular Iphone 16 doesn't even have 120Hz 🤣
2025-02-19,Are you really expecting them to give the cheapest model 120Hz (90Hz even would be surprising)
2025-02-20,Ever heard of inflation?
2025-02-19,"I use it in my car, it's the best phone mount ive found. I might just get a magsafe case for my pixel 8a and ditch the 12 mini ive had, i only use it for waze now.."
2025-02-19,"Wireless charging so it becomes a very nice clock at night, external batteries stay attached, phone can be easily attached in a car, can attach various items : card holder, webcam holder, and probably more."
2025-02-20,"MagSafe is the reason why I never have to think about charging my phone during the week, I commute 30 min to work, put my phone on my MagSafe holder/charger in my car and use google maps for traffic infos. Also MagSafe is really convenient for wireless charging, because the coils align always and it’s fast, i just bring it near the holder and snap its securely fastent via magnets"
2025-02-20,"Nothing you can't get from a magsafe case, which you'll get on your phone anyways if you want magsafe to work. At the end of the day, it's 200 dollars cheaper than the iphone 16, in exchange you lose magsafe on the phone, which is absolutely irrelevant, you have a different type of notch with no dynamic island and one less camera on the back."
2025-02-19,"For me it’s mostly having a MagSafe charger as my car phone mount. Just pop it on there when I get in the car & I’m good to go, without needing a special magnetic case or magnetic plate stuck to the phone like in the past"
2025-03-15,The charging port on my 13 mini won’t hold the cable for long. The only way I can recharge is with magsafe.
2025-02-19,"I use MagSafe whenever I can. I use it in the car for charging and for GPS - previously I would install a metal disk on the phone and a magnetic mount on the car vent and charge via cable.

At home I have a MagSafe stand on essentially every desk and night stand because it's so convenient for charging and it's ergonomic for glancing at information or watching YouTube videos while eating.

At work, we capture evidence with iPhones, and it's nice to have a MagSafe stand to rotate the phone and have it rock solid for video capture.

Even on my iPhone 13 Mini, the battery has never dropped below 30% because it is constantly on a MagSafe stand for some kind of purpose."
2025-02-20,I have a 12 mini but it's absolutely on it's last legs.. bought a pixel 8a to ride out the wait for my next small phone
2025-02-20,What else is small like the mini. I need a small phone for physical work.
2025-02-22,"The battery life on the mini series is almost equal to the iPhone X, which didn’t have a good battery life. iPhone 16e will blow iPhone 13 mini out of the water in the battery life category. 6.1"" can be called small. iPhone 13 mini is so tiny that it feels outdated."
2025-02-20,Appreciate the offer however it looks like you aren't in the uk
2025-02-20,That's not going to make a difference to me ultimately...
2025-02-20,"Yep, I have a refurb tracker alert. I bought one within 5 mins of it coming up. Looks like they have a few, 128gb, 256gb and 512gb all showing in stock"
2025-02-22,"yeah if my mini dies i go to android with the jelly max

and apple dosnt even know they exist because a 13 mini is better in any way"
2025-02-19,True.  But companies are making such big efforts and compromises to make phones as thin as they are (and we are all paying for it).  I really don’t like throwing that away by using a case.
2025-02-20,"Apple always makes their announcements longer than they have to be. They turn an announcement that they are turning carbon neutral through a 10 minute long overly self-congratulatory play. I support the cause, but could have been a 20 second announcement. If anything, I’m surprised it wasn’t double the length with how much they usually talk about"
2025-02-19,Hell yeah 😂
2025-02-21,"Hopefully, although they won't learn from it"
2025-03-02,"We upgraded our 80 year old fathers 2nd gen SE to this with ATT special 5.99 / 36 months making the phone, taxes and upgrade fee under 300.00 when it’s all said and done.

Perfect for him."
2025-02-20,"New things:  8GB of RAM, new CPU, larger battery, Apple Intelligence, USB C."
2025-03-04,"I don't know if this argument applies to everyone. I have a 13, I charge via MagSafe, no USB C isn't an issue for me. In fact *losing* the MagSafe would impact me more than I'm currently impacted by needed to connect physically with lightning.

And, having used apple intelligence on my other Apple devices, it's dogshit and provides no meaningful functionality which can't be had on any other phones by just installing the ChatGPT app. In my opinion."
2025-02-20,"£100 diff in the UK if you look on the Apple store, £50 or less via 3rd party. I think that 15 is £50 better, not even talking about ""open box"" options or refurbs that will be cheaper and still better."
2025-02-22,Yea and everyone _really_ cares about that
2025-03-10,"1. ""against the iPhone 14 it replaces.""

2. It is the definition of mid, it is one single sensor without any auxiliary information from the other sensors the photos will be legible but emotionless.

3. It will have more clarity, especially in lower light scenarios, iPhone 7's now relativity blurry photos now have a nostalgia emotion attached to it something the iPhone 16e's newness can at best artificially simulate. iPhone 16e is a good phone with which to take your LinkedIn headshot profile photo. You are not trying to impress anyone just let people know you exist."
2025-02-19,"Permanent 25% sale in exchange for a lot of things that people won’t care about. Seems good to me, and I’m surprised to see this thread is so negative. The 16 was already a decent value (all things considered), and consider that these things will be even cheaper than a 16 once you factor in carrier deals, etc."
2025-02-20,It’s 699€. A new iPhone 16 is 819€ from official stores and 750€ if you trust some sketchier ones. I immediately bought the regular 16 yesterday after they announced the price. So not worth it for 120€ saving.
2025-02-20,"Yeah, I think this is basically Apple squeezing the Boomers for while they are still around. They know most Boomers will buy the cheapest phone, and that Boomers are ""locked in"" to their ecosystem, so why not make the cheapest phone as expensive as possible and bleed them for every last cent? 

The message everyone else should take from this is get out of Apple ecosystem while you still can. This is a predatory company that has no respect for its consumers and someday you are going to be the Boomer they cynically squeeze for every last ounce of blood. Chinese are now offering quality phones at reasonable prices. Samsung and Google sadly tend to follow Apple's pricing policies but at least have enough sense of shame that they feel compelled to give you some kind of value in exchange for the cost."
2025-02-19,It's $600 though.
2025-02-19,Yeah 250€ difference on apples own website. But only 120€ between other retailers and 16e price from apple.
2025-02-20,Huh? It’s 699€ and you can get the 16 for 820€ right now. Even less if you trust some of the sketchier stores. I literally ordered the 16 yesterday for 820€ from Amazon after they announced the ridiculous price for the 16e.
2025-02-22,">the SE was never a small phone

The SE has been the smallest phone in the lineup for many years. The 13 mini was the only other comparably-sized phone."
2025-02-19,Yes ? 300$ Chinese phones have 120 Hz screens
2025-02-19,its a 700€ phone....
2025-02-20,"$650 in 2017 adjust for 2025 inflation is $836.

And this is a budget phone, not a flagship.

But yeah, inflation."
2025-02-19,Yeah that’s smart I’ve never thought of that but seems really convenient. I guess it’s not suitable for motorbikes though 😅
2025-03-17,Just get a magnetic sticker??? I use one on my XS Max and it’s amazing
2025-02-20,IMO the ultra wide camera has always been a gimmick. The 2x feels a lot more practical for the phone to be a travel companion taking tourist photos.
2025-02-21,unihertz jelly max but a downgrade in any aspect
2025-02-22,"Depends on your usage. My battery lasts me just fine throughout the day on the mini, but I agree it’s not great. The mini is such a good size because you can actually use it with one hand."
2025-02-20,that's great!
2025-02-20,This phone is literally thicker than the SE.
2025-02-20,"🤦a the justification. people have been used cases since forever since they don't want to spend 300 dollars everytime they drop their phone.

how thin they are it's just a bigger reason to get one lol"
2025-02-21,"I'm an avid Samsung enthusiast and even I agree with this. As great as Samsung phones may be when newly released, they're just simply not worth it when you see how much they lose in value in a matter of a year or two."
2025-02-19,And 16e doesn't have it?  Why? How do you know? It's not mentioned in the presentation
2025-02-23,But it is kind of an up to date and future proof feature. I personally won't buy a phone with important features missing.
2025-02-20,That I agree with
2025-02-20,"The S23fe is 450€ over here, whch is 150 cheaper"
2025-02-19,That’s right but I would guess that the 16e will also go down in price but only time will tell… I‘m still curious why so many people care about magsafe…? Don’t thicker cases have those magnets in them anyway? So I guess you can then just get a case with magnets and have the same functionality just with a slower charging speed or am I overlooking something here?
2025-02-20,Yeah I just compared the prices on apple.de but I guess the 16e will also drop in price on third party sites
2025-02-19,"Base 16 models did not get it, there was 0% chance that SE would few months later lol"
2025-02-19,"Sorry, you expect Apple to care about what anyone else is doing? When have they ever?"
2025-02-20,"Yeah like my phone, but it's not Apple"
2025-02-20,"Is it still not the cheapest ""new"" phone they sell"
2025-02-20,Where did you see it marketed as a budget phone? Source?
2025-02-20,"Nothing is suitable for motorbikes, the heavy vibrations damage a lot of phones. Had several friends damage their cameras this way"
2025-02-24,"I might be interested, DM me"
2025-02-21,"The positive way to see it is how affordable they are if you get last year's model or even refurbished models. 

I currently own a Pixel 7 Pro, which I got refurbished when it was mid or late cycle and got it at half price. The phone had 0 signs that it had ever been used.

Those deals are not to be had with iPhone. 

I'm currently looking into switching to iPhone mainly cuz I'm an iphone developer; but that's the main reason preventing me from it. I don't want to get scammed; and feels like the iPhones are a scam due to how bad of a deal they are."
2025-03-05,Nobody pays full price for samsung phones. Samsung always offers great discounts on new just launched phones. The listing price is just there to try to look more premium. That said this iphone is a borderline scam. 60hz single camera in 2025
2025-02-25,"Oh I don't care, I live in the modern world not america lol you guys are *fuuuucked*"
2025-02-23,"To each their own. I don't find it important or useful, thus don't see a reason to get 16e. Like I absolutely see Type C as an important feature so nothing below 15 makes sense for me, but subpar Apple intelligence? Nah."
2025-02-19,"Yeah i assume the 16e will drop too of course but not for a while. 

I think the magsafe(magnets not speed) was just a feature they removed without a reason. A nail in the coffin. I would love either magsafe or dynamic island."
2025-02-20,I'm just say Samsung is following the scummery Apple is doing

2025-02-19,"At least in the USA, who the F is still using hsdpa?

No mmwave is more or less whatever, would be nice to have, but a freaking tree blocks the signal so it's more or less useless, that's why C Band (\~3.7ghz) is getting pushed so hard by ATT and Verizon. I've gotten 1.5Gbit/s down on T-Mobiles N41 (\~2.5ghz),

2025-02-20,What?
2025-02-26,"> American-based language.

Pmsl"
2025-02-20,I'm sure Apple would've support only 4G and 5G cellular if they could. They would also ask themselves 'who the fuck is still using 2G and 3G?'
2025-02-19,"LTT is Canadian, but the largest part of their users are from the USA. T-Mobile and ATT in the USA used HSPA calling it either 3G or 4G and have more or less killed it in favor of LTE and NR (5G)

  
Looking at Cell Mapper, it does seem like at least Rogers still has their 3G network up, but it looks much smaller than their LTE network."
2025-03-07,"the white does look pretty nice, after years of having dark coloured iPhones (black 7+, red 11, green 13 mini) i might get a white or silver one next."
2025-03-07,"Good no nonsense phone. I'd buy it but since i was in the market last year i've grabbed normal 15, so no new phones for me for at least 5 years.

I'd prefer it in mini form factor though."

2025-03-07,"I got my 16e on launch day, upgraded from an iPhone XR.  Honestly, I really like this iPhone.  The most underrated feature is the extra storage space for anyone who is upgrading from an iPhone with less than 100GB of space.  I also like how the battery lasts me the whole day without having to recharge it."
2025-03-07,Do you notice the reduction in screen brightness much ?
2025-03-07,"I've had mine 3 days and am happy with my decision, especially for my use case. Personally, comparing the price to the SE was wasted time. Accept $599 is now the cheapest iPhone and focus on differences with other models. I almost bought a 16 but realized none of the differences mattered to me for an extra $200."
2025-03-07,"I think software upgrades will be for up to 7 years now, at least thats the trend we have been seeing from the xs and xr."
2025-03-07,Does anyone know if adding a case with MagSafe components will work the same as having it built into the phone? I am ok with slow charging.
2025-03-07,Glad to hear all the positive reviews.
2025-03-11,"Nice review. I think the 16e hate is overblown. Yes, it’s not that much cheaper than the normal 16. But it’s also barely any worse, at least not for stuff that actually matters.

Notch instead of dynamic island? No practical difference. 

No ultrawide lens? When I rarely use mine, pictures are shit — the normal lens has much better quality anyway, and is the more flattering perspective.

Slightly worse processor? It’s still insanely fast.

No magafe and Qi2? Well that one actually makes a day to day difference. It’s the only downgrade that irks me."
2025-03-07,The best thing about this phone is it’s appearance.
2025-03-07,I’d imagine the software support will be more like 6-7 years.
2025-03-07,"Great review, sounds like you're overall happy with the phone. I've owned an 11 for 5 years so 16e would be a massive upgrade for me, my biggest gripe is price, I buy new from the Apple store so I'll wait for the sales later in the year. Thank you for sharing your experience. Congrats on the new phone."
2025-03-08,I love that the C1 modem is a pro in a experience review. I just upgraded from a iphone xs to a 16 and the only pro/difference I feel is the wide lens camera. It's super convenient!
2025-03-08,"Personally the one thing holding me back from recommending it to everyone is MagSafe. I know you can add it with a case but I go caseless. 
I use it everywhere, MagSafe power bank, MagSafe Car mount/ charger, MagSafe night stand. The snap into place and knowing it’s charging is just perfect."
2025-03-09,"I'm upgrading from a 2022 SE out of necessity. Honestly I'm gutted that they discontinued the SE form factor because it literally has not changed since the iPhone 6—a testament to how utterly perfect that design is. I'm thankful that the 16e is only slightly bulkier so I can still fit it in my pocket. I'm not happy about losing touch ID or gaining a stupid notch so I can't properly see the upper icons. 

The phone itself seems fine. The price is kinda sucky but I'm trading in a completely unused iPhone11 for $130 so we'll see if they honor their trade in claims. If so it's a good deal since I got it for free from a well-meaning relative and trying to sell it private party is too much hassle."
2025-03-10,"Im still rocking my iPhone 12, I was excited for the new phone until I saw the price. It is a down grade for anyone with a 15/16. For me it’d be an upgrade I guess but I’m not excited enough so I’ll hold onto my 12 a bit longer."

2025-03-16,is face ID better on 15&16 than 14? never heard of it
2025-03-22,I upgraded mine from 15 pro max to 16e!
2025-03-07,I like mine so far. Battery life is definitely good. I got a defender magsafe case and im really enjoying the magsafe wallet and the magsafe charger works incredibly well.
2025-03-07,I love the micro SD support on the 16e
2025-03-09,How’s the battery life compared to 15 or 16 Plus? Thinking of going back to a smaller form factor
2025-03-09,this will be a good upgrade from iphone 11 then right
2025-03-09,"i honestly can't decide if I should save my money and go for this or the 16? I'd either get the 256GB version

2025-03-10,"I would love to have iPhone 16e as my secondary device since my main device is galaxy A54 and I'm looking for secondary device just to experience the OS and speaking of the design and build quality is just my thing since i fond the design of iPhone 16e and it gave the vibe of iPhone 14 screen + iPhone 8 camera = iPhone 16e and the colour and camera is fine to me since I'm a minimalist user who just wanted a iPhone for general use like texting, social media and watching videos and doesn't really take much photos that's all lol. I think iPhone 16e is fine for secondary phone but not day to day user. I can't really say it on behalf"

2025-03-22,I would’ve gotten that if there are more colors to choose from and magsafe was a dealbreaker coz I’ve got sweaty hands + it’s hard to find a case with grips
2025-03-25,"First off, sorry in advance for the long response!

I concur with a lot of you experience. I bought a new 16e for under $472 total (it's locked to TMo) on p2p market. I'm coming back to iOS after 1.5 years back with Android for various reasons I won't bore you with. Then, someone on FB took up my trade offer to swap my like new S25 Plus with their like new 16 Pro. So, I've been using them both for a few days.

  
1) Camera

The camera on the 16e is definitely **just fine**. Outdoors, indoor with lots of natural light? Pics look like any other unless you're determined to zoom in and find the weaknesses. Dimmer light, the focus definitely gets noticeable challenged. It'll focus on inanimate objects better than people or maybe it's just my kids being ghouls. In extremely low light, like pitch dark with only a night lamp, it'll gather enough light so you can see the picture, but the quality is just bad. When I've tested it by increasing exposure and really trying hard to hold my hand still, the image was slightly better, but still nothing like the 16pro (which is NOTHING like the Pixel 9). Anyway, if someone is just taking pics for fun, for memories, for posting on socials, it's fine. If someone wants to make some high res content, it's clearly not the phone for them.

2) Refresh Rate

Looking at the 16e's 60hz vs the pro's 120hz, I gotta say I barely tell the difference. When I switched the S25+ from 60hz to 120hz, I definitely saw a difference. Other posts have said that apparently the scrollling is limited to 80hz, but I'm not digging in that far. Overall, I can't tell the difference, so no biggie on this common complaint for me.

3) Notch vs Dynamic Island

I have a 13PM for work and because it's bigger the notch really didn't bother me. On the 16e, with its smaller size, it sure is more noticeable. But, I don't really mind it much. I watched something on both phones and zoomed in to fill the screen, and I didn't really get much viewing area back with the island over the notch. The Dynamic Island's been relatively useless to me so far - just like Samsung's Now Brief that I had on the S25+. 

4) Other Stuff

\- Battery life is legit! With other phones, I lost a lot more battery while connected to Carplay. On screen time has been great. I use my phone mainly for music, navigation on CarPlay, messaging folks, reading stuff, watching stuff, and playing mostly low (no) GPU needs games.

\- The speakers are better than the S25+ or any other flagship android phone I've used. They've always been a little tinny or someone sounding like coming out of a drain. The 16e sounds much more full.

\- The camera button on the 16 Pro has been nice to have for a quick launch of the camera. But I don't miss it much on the 16e since I just use the Action Button for the camera. Then, I just learned how to customize the back tap options in the Accessibility menu.

Ultimately, I'm still deciding on what to keep. I know at some point I'll want to make some content and need to use my phone to do so or I'll be at an indoor show and want some decent snaps of what's happening rather than the washed out mess that I had with the iPhone 13. I do recognize the price I paid for it is probably closer to an acceptable price point for most people. I knew that I could sell it at cost if I absolutely hated it. But the 16e's been fun to use and hasn't felt like a ""downgrade"" except for the camera and for readjustment back to iOS restrictions from Android. So, for anyone that doesn't need the other bells and whistles.. it's a perfectly fun phone."
2025-03-26,Laggy home screen and when opening apps is my biggest problems will this be fixed ? Regretting it at the moment it actually feels less than 60hz
2025-03-07,"Looks pretty nice, but i miss the SE2"
2025-03-08,Would be pretty much a perfect phone for me only if it had 120hz promotion display. But this wont ever happen I guess.
2025-03-07,If xr will get next ios update then this will have atleast 6 years
2025-03-07,"I think it’s probably a fine phone but should have been at least $100 less and come in more colors — think 5c. Blue, green, red, yellow etc"
2025-03-07,"Sounds like  only actual  ""pro"" I see in your list is USB C."
2025-03-07,"The price is a total ripoff
  
I just bought a brand new Samusung S24fe last black friday, unlocked for $129

Apple is crazy charging $600 for an entry level phone"
2025-03-07,"Could not live without MagSafe now, I cannot believe they ditched it"
2025-03-07,I got the 16 and i miss my green 13 mini i still cant get used to the size difference its just a pain typing with one hand now 😭
2025-03-11,"I also got the white the phone is actually pretty decent considering all the 'hate' it's received. 

I have been having trouble with the network in my area in O2 in the UK and I've done all the trouble shooting I can possibly care to give this phone (reset network settings, restore, sim in out, new sim and esim).

I've contacted apple and they said they can swap it out for a new one obviously with credit card hold. 

The one thing I will say is that the battery has been solid on this phone I'm left with about 50% end of day."
2025-03-10,There are promos for this everywhere. You can get it for free. Why 5 years?
2025-03-08,you’re apple’s favorite kind of customer
2025-03-08,You mean downgraded?
2025-03-09,"> upgraded from iPhone 15

Can’t make this shit up lmao"
2025-03-08,"This is a hard side-grade. Worse GPU, worse display, worse camera, just a better CPU and arguably better battery life."
2025-03-09,"> I upgraded from iPhone 15

You trolling?"
2025-03-09,Why tf would you get a iphone 16e when you had the 15? You realize a 15 is more expensive still?
2025-03-07,"Yes they have premium cases, I'm waiting for the 16e leather case!"
2025-03-07,How does the battery life compare vs 16 Pro? Is the 16e significantly better?
2025-03-07,Why would you get a 16e if you have a 16 pro
2025-03-08,What did you do with your 16pro? And why did you decide to change ?
2025-03-07,Hows battery life?
2025-03-12,I currently have the XR and looking to upgrade. Never heard of the 16e until I was looking at the shop so don’t know a thing about it and this thread was the first google result. Anything you hate about it how it compares to the XR? I’m not picky at all so don’t care too much about any of the tech stuff really.
2025-03-12,Yea I have a 12 and I’m bout to upgrade today. I just had the xr also
2025-03-07,"Not that much, unless under heavy sunlight, but my 16 Pro would also drop brightness quite fast under this situation, so not much of a difference"
2025-03-11,There ya go. People are talking like 200 ain't nothing and you should throw it away for things you don't care. How crazy is that.
2025-03-13,That’s how it should be! Buy for your usage not “social media pressure”. My wife got an iPhone 16e she loves it. I got an iPhone 16 because I use magesafe and enjoy taking pictures with the wide camera. We both upgraded from iPhone 13 with take-in deal (250$+ taxes) per phone.
2025-03-07,It will cling to the charger like a MagSafe but you won't get the fast charging
2025-03-07,"I bought a wallet case with Magsafe (and a Magnetic ring to stick on my iphone SE) and it works fine to keep the wallet on. I already have a QI wireless charger (really slow) but as noted it doesn't mean you get mag charging (or whatevee the fluff it is calles) or improve the charge speed. You do get a Magsafe wallet you can pop on the phone though if that's your thing (as it's my thing I'm chuffed, and disappointed to see the 16e doesn't have it)"
2025-03-29,I’m upgrading from a 2020 SE and I feel this. I love Touch ID and think the SE is the perfect phone for someone who just has casual uses for their phone. Gonna upgrade to the 16e this week.
2025-03-08,"Just like every iPhone before it, the iPhone 16e does not include a microSD card slot. Apple has never included expandable storage in any of its smartphones, and the iPhone 16e is no exception"
2025-03-10,"Can’t speak for iPhone 13 but they are really good. Like how can such a small device produce such a loud and clear sound. It’s iPad level good sound, or at least 8th gen iPad."
2025-03-14,"no, just buy an iphone 15."
2025-03-26,What do you mean by delay?
2025-03-10,Notch is not outdated for anyone updating from a non-notch phone
2025-03-07,Dude the launch price of the s24fe was $649
2025-03-08,Buy a case. Bam. 16e with MagSafe.
2025-03-07,wanna do a 1-1 swap 😂? i just changed the battery on mine
2025-03-10,I like to use my electronics until they die
2025-03-17,"Better GPU, stop spreading misinformation, 4 Core A18 still beats the old 5 core A16, and also has more features.

16e display is SLIGHTLY worse, the only scenario it is worse is in outdoor ambient under heavy sunlight

Also 16e has 8GB RAM were 15 has 6GB RAM.

**15:**

* better camera
* MagSafe
* Dynamic Island
* better screen (marginally)
* UWB

**16e:**

* better CPU
* better GPU
* more RAM
* Apple Intelligence support
* \+1 year of iOS updates
* better battery life"
2025-03-09,"He's an isheep.  He's the ideal apple customer.


Hyper Consumerism"
2025-03-07,"I think it’s quite better than 16 Pro, for workdays with light loads 16 Pro gets me through a day with 10-20% left, but 16e even with relatively heavy loads it also left around the same percentage, I think maybe 8h vs 10h screen on time difference?"
2025-03-07,"As a backup phone, I had an android phone for backup before, but most of the features I use daily are just not good enough or just not there, especially cross device compatibility. I sent my 16 Pro for repair few months ago, and the experience with my other Apple products was terrible."
2025-03-08,"Sent for repair, not actually swapping the 16 Pro with it, I just want to try it and write a review, when 16 Pro is back from repair the 16e will be my backup phone"
2025-03-07,"Pretty good, the longest I had with a single charge was 10.5h+2.5h standby, with some daily apps like video streaming, maps, camera, music, social media, etc., and before charging for next day I think it still had around 10% left?"
2025-03-15,"Since I do not have a lot of USB C accessories and I am upgrading from a lighting port iPhone, I would say filling up my home with USB C cables and USB C to USB A adapters is kind of a pain in the butt.  The double ended USB C cable that comes with the iPhone doesn’t help me because 97% of my tech has USB A ports.  I had to go on Amazon & purchase some adapters.

The slower charging speeds might be an issue for some people but I’m the kind that docks my iPhone at the end of the day and wakes up to a full battery in the morning."
2025-03-15,"The iPhone XR is such a great iPhone.  I downgraded it as my backup iPhone & the “fun” iPhone where I can load it with games.  As a matter of fact, I loaded up all my PSP game saves onto it & use it as my PSP as my real PSP’s UMD drive is worn out."
2025-03-07,My 15 Pro Max gets so dimm under sunlight due to heat that nits become just a bragging right on paper.
2025-03-11,I’ve never had issue with my earbuds and the camera is fine for what I care to take pictures of. I also never really have battery issues either. Mostly I just like the size and the “Home” button but the other stuff doesn’t bother me too much.
2025-03-29,"I’ve had my 16e for almost a month now and honestly… I hate it. I added the assistive touch button so I could more easily access the control center and other stuff and it helps a little but nothing replaces the home button. The size isn’t too bad, it’s honestly just marginally larger than the SE overall but the lack of a home button is so frustrating, I find myself cussing at my phone constantly. So far the only plus is the battery life."
2025-03-26,Like jittery feel not smooth when opening apps and flicking threw apps on main screen
2025-03-16,That's a very smart argument to make for it. /s
2025-03-07,"Yeah, was the price I paid too high?"
2025-03-09,That’s not true the charging isn’t the MagSafe speed with just a case.
2025-03-11,I mean i still have my mini but im a butthurt if my phone has any damage $279 for a new screen and $90 for a new battery at apple but the mini feels so good in the hand compared to reg size iphone i think people who never owned one dont know what they missed
2025-03-17,"So, I was hit with the apparent dissonance of your claim and mine. I rechecked the benchmarks and noticed, I was looking at the 2160p benchmarks where 16e is \~14 (Wild Life Extreme). This is, of course, not the right benchmark as the 1440p is much closer (Solar bay). There, 16e is indeed ahead of the 15. ([source](https://www.gsmarena.com/apple_iphone_16e-review-2805p4.php)) Good catch, thanks!

However, claiming that the panel is ""SLIGHTLY worse"" sounds a bit disingenuous to me. However, not many people are interested in panel efficiency, etc."
2025-03-26,Thanks for that information. People lose all objectivity just to hate on apple lol
2025-03-11,"It is still a side-grade. Much worse camera (sensor is much smaller, OIS is worse, missing telephoto, missing wide angle), worse display, and worse GPU, on the other hand, arguably better battery life, and 1 (?) extra year of SW updates+”AI”. With that, no UWB and thus no precise location of airtags and airpods. (MagSafe is arguably niche.)

I am not arguing that 16e isn’t good in all three. It definitely is. But we are comparing 16e and 15 here."
2025-03-14,THE CAMERA IS THE SAME ON AN IPHONE 4!  HOW CAN IT NOT BE THAT MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE???
2025-03-07,Why do you need a backup phone? What makes you buy 600 bucks for that only?
2025-03-15,Do you think upgrading from a 12 to 16e is worth the money? I’m going to get it for half off. So around 299 plus 50 for the service
2025-03-08,"Yeah that’s the problem, not that much of a difference in real life"
2025-03-26,"That's strange, has this happened on any other iPhones? Maybe some function in the settings has been turned on."
2025-03-07,No
2025-03-11,"My last one was Xs max, battery was good for two days of use. Loved it. Replaced battery two times and unfortunately broke it and repair had no sense financially. 15 is good but it rarely goes through two days."
2025-03-09,Y’all need to calm down if he/she decides to spend their money on 200 of the same phone then that’s their choice. Pegging them about it doesn’t change it. It just makes you sound jealous and stupid.
2025-03-07,Simply because I also enjoy buying and collecting digital/tech products? Just like other people interested in collecting shoes or clothing or figurine or whatever
2025-03-16,"Yes, I’d say $300 for the phone is a fair price for the 16e."
2025-03-27,Not sure it just feels choppy to me people with iphone 16 said the same on ios 18 maybe it needs an update 18.4 maybe
2025-03-10,"""Pegging them...""
Wow, that got sexual fast!"
2025-03-07,consumerism final boss
2025-03-08,Hahaha true. Buying rapidly depreciating gadgets you don’t need is fast tracking to poverty lol.
2025-03-11,You realize what pegging is?
2025-03-08,"You don't know this person's financial situation.  What if they own multiple homes, several brand new cars and have 6-7 figures in the bank?"
2025-03-11,"Well, I don’t think you need to worry about that anytime soon :)

2025-03-13,"Also, I was making a joke from the beginning. Humor for when one word has more meanings and the most absurd one is chosen to be funny.

2025-03-11,So I am not pathetic if I’m in poverty and I am suffering daily……?
2025-03-11,"So you consider someone to be in poverty and suffering if they don't own multiple homes, several brand new cars and have 6-7 figures in the bank?"
2025-03-11,"That’s what you said lol. Having financial stability and assets automatically makes someone 'pathetic'? If someone works hard, invests wisely, and builds wealth, that makes them a 'hyper consumerist'? And you were literally implying that it's better to be broke?"
2025-03-11,You've drunk the cool-aid. May Allah show you the right path
2025-03-27,"Respectfully, this is the only aspect of this persons financial decisions you know about. For all you know they may make plenty of money, have a simple small house, drive a 20 year old car, are minimalist in most of their life, give 50k away to charity away every year, and spent hours a week volunteering. 

And in the context of that you’ve zeroed in on one spot where they splurge a little on something they like to do - spend $600 on a phone 6+ months after they bought a previous one. 

Similarly, it’s entirely possible that someone could swoop in on your decisions asserting that anyone who doesn’t buy a Fair Phone (and only once per 6 years) “drinks the kool aid of consumerism and is thinks blood minerals are great.”

In the context of everything you’ve said, from an onlookers perspective — you are playing the roll of a troll here (who knows, maybe that’s what you are trying to do)."
2025-03-27,Did the mention of Allah (swt) make you think I'm a troll?
2025-03-28,"I honestly completely glossed over you mentioning Allah.

If I gave that impression at all, sorry about that. As far as I feel/hope, my own beliefs and views about the world wouldn’t cause me to jump to conclusions based on that."
2025-02-28,"This is for people who wanted a normal 13 or 14 six months ago, this is the replacement. It sucks they killed the sub 500 iPhone though."
2025-02-27,It’s a great phone. It’s just too expensive.
2025-02-28,I love the way it looks. So simple!
2025-02-27,"The SE has always been an “eh, it’s alright” product line. It was just priced attractively, and fairly, which made it feel less so."
2025-03-02,"I bought one.  Got delivered on Friday.  It is an upgrade from an XS that that had both the speakers go bad.  I am happy with the purchase.  I like that it is brand new with a brand new battery and future-proof.  I was really hoping that it was going to be $499 and was very disappointed when I woke up in the morning and saw that it was $599.  I had to grapple with the price increase, but decided it was still a good value for my needs.  I think Apple priced it well, if it was less, it would take away sales from the other models.  I this the big disservice is that the price rumors were wrong, so everyone was expecting it to cost less."
2025-02-28,"$400-500 is acceptable

$600 im keeping my iPhone 11"
2025-02-28,"If the iPhone 16e had a larger screen, it would seem like a good value compared to the iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, with its smaller screen, it inevitably gets compared to budget iPhones, and it's hard not to conclude that it's overpriced for the features it lacks."
2025-02-28,It’s the phone designed to look cheap compared to a $1100 17Pro.
2025-02-28,At this price I'll just stick with my SE3. It still works perfectly fine.
2025-02-28,"SE2020 here 
And damn that phone looks clean AF 
But really wondering between 16e and 15pro hmm hmmm"
2025-03-01,I still have an 8plus. This looks good enough for me lol
2025-02-28,This was the same problem with the iPad 10. They need to lower the price and then it would be worth it. $449 for a base iPad and $599 for a base iPhone is crazy
2025-02-27,I just. Want to know if it matches battery life of 14 plus
2025-03-01,"I just traded my 13 in for this one yesterday and because of deal they had it's only going to $4 a month. For that price, I can't really complain. I paid more for my 13 than this one and it's running a lot more smoothly. Hoping that the battery doesn't suck as my 13's battery was awful, it's supposed to be okay with the right wattage block that goes into the wall. We'll see how it goes. It's much more affordable than the other 16's that just came out as well"
2025-03-01,TOOOOOOO FKG BIG!
2025-03-03,"In the UK you can get a 14 Pro Max for cheaper, granted you won’t get ‘Apple intelligence’ (stop laughing) and it’s not supported for as long but even if you throw in the price of a potential battery replacement it seems no contest to me."
2025-03-06,"I used iphone 11 for almost 5 years and it's still working fine but low battery health. 

I was deciding whether I should replace my battery or get a new iphone and seemed like 16E wasn't a bad choice for me. So I bought it yesterday. 

For people like me who have old iphone and don't wanna pay $1000 for 16 pro, it's not a bad upgrade for $600 haha.  At this point, it's all self-satisfaction."
2025-03-18,"With all the iPhone deals available 16e is actually priced at $350-400 in most cases. Straight talk, Verizon prepaid deal. You just have to wait 2 months to get it unlocked. What’s not to like?"
2025-02-28,Just get a refurbished 15
2025-02-28,can’t stand apple selling phones in 2025 with 60hz. no no no
2025-02-28,"The battery life is something that has received near universal praise, so that’s really cool to see. The price just sucks. Maybe with deals that some places are certain to have it’ll be a good bargain."
2025-02-28,"There are some killer carrier deals though. On T-Mobile, it's free to upgrade from iPhone 13 even on older plans, at least if you do it at Costco."
2025-02-28,Then It's not a great phone.
2025-02-28,For 100 USD/Euros less it would be just a great phone.
2025-02-28,"Me too! It’s been a while since I’ve felt like a new iPhone looked good. Now if only it was smaller, I’d honestly buy it in a heartbeat, even at that price"
2025-03-03,reminds me of the 4/4s models
2025-03-21,"Hello, can i ask you something? I see that often people find apple products expensive in the US. I believe you are from there. So here is my question, why do you think the iphone is expensive ? If you gain minimal weight, you only need to work 2 weeks to afford a base model, am i right?

Please forgive me if my english is bad, is not my first language."
2025-03-09,How’s the battery?
2025-03-03,16 e is actually a huge upgrade from the 11 lol.
2025-02-28,I'm amazed I have had my Mini for so long. Battery at 78 but it's not a problem for me.
2025-02-28,"It's not even a small screen; it's the same size as the 16 and not much smaller than the 16 Pro, which is baffling IMO. Would've been nice if it was 5.8"" or had a mini 5.4"" size."
2025-03-04,"I’m still on my little SE2, but it can’t take any more updates & is getting a bit dicey.  I’m on 18.3 now."
2025-02-28,The base iPad is now $349 USD
2025-02-28,"everything has gotten expensive recently. I guess except labor? Like hey! Prices are up, costs are tough! 50% increase! But salaries and wages? Oh, we'll give you 6%."
2025-02-28,Ehh my dad paid the equivalent of $8k for a pc back in the 80’s. $449 seems cheap to me.
2025-02-28,"Based on my very limited and quick research, the 14 plus gets approx 11:57 of battery, whereas the 16e gets 12:41. So, it exceeds the 14 plus battery life."
2025-03-09,How is the battery on your 16e ?
2025-03-11,"I have the 13 now and am thinking of buying the 16e as well. The 13 battery life has been awful, I agree!"
2025-02-28,Or 14 or 13 Pro. 60hz for a 700 euro plus phone is whack.
2025-02-28,"Yeah it’s only $71 ($1.99 for 36 months) through ATT, with no trade-in perfect phone for my mom IMO. Though apparently it’s the same price for the iPhone 15 currently as well…"
2025-02-28,"Not according to Toms Guide though

2025-03-01,Battery at the cost of having a 60hz screen
2025-03-26,"Everything is expensive in the US. Working minimum wage doesn’t even afford you a house or apartment to rent. With the cost of food, car, insurance, etc- it’s expensive. The cost of living is much higher than the minimum wage, it doesn’t make financial sense."
2025-03-11,It's great.  Pretty hard to beat.
2025-02-28,Haha same …
2025-03-04,"So is the 15 Pro, which can now be bought for $600 as well through refurbished/renewed devices. I understand getting the 16e for free with a carrier deal etc. sounds great, but only somebody with brain damage is going to buy it for $600. 60Hz, low brigtness screen, neutered camera because of a much smaller sensor and also missing sensor shift stabilization, no magsafe, ancient wireless charging speed and no UWB. Asking $600 for this downgrade is a scam, no matter how large battery they put in it."
2025-03-04,Which ios version are you running?
2025-03-18,just installed 18.3.2 on my SE2 this morning.  Seems to be running fine.
2025-03-01,Chinese minimum wage has increased by something like 250% over the last decade. That’s why things are expensive.
2025-02-28,"Yeah we'll my dad paid 10c for a loaf of bread in the 70s, $449 seems expensive to me."
2025-02-28,Awesome. I am going to get it then as I am not required to pay much for this upgrade
2025-03-09,"It's currently much better than my 13! We will see as time goes on, but my 13 was dying in the middle of the day. With the 16 I'm barely charging my phone now, maybe once a day or every other day! And it charges super fast!"
2025-02-28,A 13 Pro only has 2 more years of software updates. The 16e has 5.
2025-03-03,30 minutes more than the 16? What’s not to like.
2025-03-27,"In here is the same, pretty much impossible to live with minimum wage. It's just that in my country we need 4 to 5 of minmum wage work to buy a recent iphone. That's why i never understand people thinking that in the US is too expensive. By the way, i'm from Brazil."
2025-03-11,"I know for you that comparison works for you, but for A LOT of consumers, comparing a used product with a brand new one with brand new battery is apples and oranges."
2025-03-04,"I have been pricing the carrier deals, and I’m not impressed so far.  I’d rather finance it and just use a monthly card at this point!  Has anybody done this?"
2025-03-04,Most recent. 18.3.1 or whatever.
2025-03-20,**good.** the workers deserve it.
2025-03-03,"It would be a downgrade in terms of camera (no ultra wide), display size, no MagSafe, no UWB chip. 
But the ram and the chip is nice though."
2025-02-28,My XS max had much more years of updates than that. This Apple AI is cringe af and a bad reason to get this overpriced 60hz mid range.
2025-03-11,"That would be true if refurbished phones didn’t have brand new batteries and didn’t use official Apple parts, which they do. I’m aware that some people want a brand new phone, and in that regard it’s still a much better deal to buy a new iPhone 15, where the only thing missing from the 16e is Apple Intelligence, which is useless anyway (speaking from experience from my 15PM). If I handed somebody both a new 16e and a refurbished 15 Pro out of their boxes, 95% of users wouldn’t be able to tell a difference in their condition. But I have to pay respect to Apple for having such customers, who just walk into a store and ask for the newest cheapest model and hand out $600 with zero research. I know a few people who did that."
2025-03-07,Really? How well does it run??
2025-03-24,I don’t disagree with that
2025-02-28,"The XS Max had 6 years of OS updates. Not “much more years of updates” 

And no one said anything about AI"
2025-03-07,Zero performance problems besides the battery wearing down. I keep it plugged in most of the time. Battery life is maybe 4-6 hours using it unplugged.
2025-02-20,999 in aus is the taking of the piss as well. That’s what I paid for my 13 2.5 years ago.
2025-02-20,"not to be a hater, because you put a lot of work into this post but are we still trying to make sense of apple pricing? just seems futile to me.

we are talking about the company whose most expensive headphones (max) do not support half the features of their $300 less (pro) counterpart. they sell a $1000 monitor stand and $700 wheels. 

is $400 for 16 GB of RAM a good value? is a $50 watch band?

they will do whatever they want and they will sell a boatload of them. yes, i agree, leaving magsafe out is asinine for the price, but we continue to buy their shit."
2025-02-20,Yep. I think it is more similar to the iPhone XR in the past. It will be worth to buy after price drop.
2025-02-20,"It is a terrible value, but it will sell, it’ll simply cannibalise the iPhone 16 (which is very similar to), so you’ll on have the 16e or 16 Pro as options now."
2025-02-20,Waiting for iPhone 45 for any significant upgrades.
2025-02-20,"I’d suspect they are either entering a new pricing era overall, or pushing the price because of Apple intelligence (which isn’t even fully out yet)"
2025-02-20,"Refurbished is the way to go for affordable iphone. The stock is always plentiful thanks to expensive carrier trade up programs. Only down side is the battery can need replacement.

I could see them keeping the 16e for a couple years and dropping the price by $100 next year, but they haven’t done that previously. Depending on inflation and tariffs they could end up raising regular iphone prices instead."
2025-02-20,"I don’t even care about the feature downgrades from the 15 & 16’s just the price.

My work uses iPhone SE’s as glorified portable devices with web browsers and basic apps for various tasks since the iPod Touch was discontinued. MDM for iOS is easier to setup and manage than Android and all our phones used by employees who get a corporate phone are iPhones.

We’ve considered switching to basic sub $200 Android phones like Moto G Play, but it was easier to manage when only doing Android for BYOD in MDM.

In 3 years we’ve gone from paying $200 for iPod Touch 7G to $600 for the handheld iOS device. It’s company money so I don’t really care, but it hurts the budget of other stuff I’d like my employer to buy."
2025-02-20,"Yeah, I think definitely is a ""Boomer Phone"" and Apple is just trying to rip off all the Boomer's they have in their ecosystem for as much money as they can while they are still around. Message to everyone else is get out of Apple's ecosystem now while you still can. Because eventually you are going to be the Boomer and this company will treat you exactly the same."
2025-02-20,"Currently I’m on a 12 Pro that I got from an Apple Store while I could a few years ago. But now, Apple likes to not sell older but perfectly capable phones. I’m gonna be getting a 14 Pro soon from Plug. It’s $480 right now."
2025-02-20,"The way I see it it’s intended primarily for corporate users. When my corporate phone is up to be replaced in May, this will likely be what I am given as it will be “free” and will have hardware which will continue to get updated for 7 years."
2025-02-20,The silly thing is all the little but very useful things they didn’t include. The things that are pretty much dealbreakers to certain population. 16e having no UWB when a person has multiple AirTags instantly ruins the phone.
2025-02-20,I wish Apple had updated the fingerprint ID or one on the “on switch (like the Samsung A series) or under-glass e-reader for my son’s requirements! He is a motorcycle and snowmobile enthusiast and he prefers a fingerprint ID on his street and dirt bikes and snowmobiles vs. Flipping up a face shield or taking off for a positive ID to use the phone. I guess some gloves can read the fingerprint without taking your gloves off! The Mag safe feature’s absence also doesn't make much sense!
2025-02-20,"To be honest, I notice since Steve Jobs died, all the phones are Copy and Paste, or removing features and on next model we add them back"
2025-02-20,"Meanwhile... 

Apple: ""GREATEST PRICE."""
2025-02-21,"The SE was the model of choice for many older adults looking for a budget-friendlier Apple. Not only does $599 move the phone completely put of budget for most seniors, but it also no makes them learn a completely new way of interacting with the phone. After years of a fingerprint reader, they have to switch to swipe gestures which are very difficult and not intuitive for most. Because of neuropathy, many seniors can’t regulate how hard or soft they are touching. And many have a hard time learning completely new ways of interacting with their devices. 

The 16e creates more problems than it solves. Whoever is in charge of market research for Apple left out a huge portion of the population. There’s no point in getting an Apple Watch with Fall Protection if you need a phone you can’t operate to update it properly."
2025-02-20,"My biggest annoyance isn’t with the 16e, it’s that the 16e has the same base storage as the 16 Pro"
2025-02-20,"I believe the marker for this phone is those who are upgrading from an older phone through the trade-in program and corporations buying for their workforce.

It’s a bad value for an end-user, might as well buy an iPhone 15 for that money but you lose apple intelligence"
2025-02-20,"Seeing the price of the phone getting more expensive than the amount I got my 15 pro in April last year. It's funny. There is no comparison.
Here the 16e official price it's 734 USD.
I paid for a new 15 pro at 660 USD."
2025-02-20,"I agree, at $500, it would be a good deal.  However, I think Apple is pricing in the coming tariffs.  You can thank Trump for that."
2025-02-21,It would be less appalling if it were 499 instead. That's terrible value for what you get
2025-02-21,I wonder if this new 16e will continue the trend of iPhones that are more repairable at a lower price point!? Guess I’ll have to wait for a tear down/destruction report by Jerry Rig Everything or other similar disassembly Pros’!
2025-02-21,"No phone apple has ever released ever has been bad, ever. 

People just judge its value from the price, as you say."
2025-02-20,"It should have been affordable entry iPhone. Instead is overpriced phone that creates confusion of what is not supported as it contains keyword ""16"". If Apple Inteligence was better that ChatGPT/DeepSeek it would have a selling point. But no is an Apple Idiot"
2025-02-20,Two worst things about Apple products are the pricing and the people who try to defend them.
2025-02-20,shitPhone without Magsafe
2025-02-20,I just don’t pay attention to Apple product announcements and I’m much happier for it. I try to just use things as long as possible until they stop working to minimize my consumption and reliance on slave labor.
2025-02-20,"Don't care about the extra cameras or camera features, don't care about magsafe gimmick, don't care about having 1 less GPU core because smartphone games are bad, don't care about color options because I just buy black anyway, don't care about UWB gimmick, don't care about wireless charging gimmick, don't care about Dynamic Island gimmick (looks just as bad as notch imo), etc etc.   
  
Literally would not be willing to pay a single dollar more for most of those features/differences if given the choice.

Apple trimmed the right amount of fat in my opinion. Price is higher than it should be, but so what, that's always been Apple's MO lol"
2025-02-20,I don't think its really meant to be a consumer phone rather one mostly marketed to business that want a fleet phone that will be relatively cheap to repair when damages inevitably occur and will have reliable updates for a while.
2025-02-20,It could go down to 499 if they come out with a 17e lol
2025-02-20,"personally think this model will get more people willing to pay the extra and got for base model but not 16 , i think more people will wait for iphone 17 air instead, i mean a lot of new features won’t be ready till ios18.5/ ios 19beta ,  its not exactly a budget phone people buy for their kids and doubt people who are still waiting on a.i. features in different countries  will take the plunge until the features are fully up and running . ok if your getting decent price for trading in older models , If people can’t wait till iphone 17"
2025-02-21,Honestly in most cases other than like 1 year of official support especially for the SE3 you are better off buying a used maybe even pro model
2025-02-21,"I look at the 16e as Apple tipping their hand at what they know to be the true attractants to the iPhone lineup. OLED screen, top tier processor, decent camera, AI (or what they at least think is AI), and customizable action button. The rest of the features of the higher end phones are minor spec bumps that the majority of people truly don’t care about. It’s more a status buy at this point to get a pro because, let’s face it, no true “pro” considers a phone to be a primary, professional level device for their profession."
2025-02-21,"Once removable batteries are back let us customize our back features. Which camera combo, same with Samsung. 1 good regular camera? Or any combination of 4+ senors we desire. I can wait."
2025-02-21,"Imo the worst trade off is cutting Magsafe. Magsafe is a revenue driver for mfi, phone cases and/or charging accessories."
2025-02-20,"I paid ~$350 for a 3 month old SE 2020 back in 2021, and now I have just about everything Apple. If it was $600 I wouldn’t have made the jump, and they’d have lost thousands in subsequent sales. Just saying…"
2025-02-20,"I actually think starting at $599 is EXACTLY the problem of this phone. This IS apple’s new budget phone, but it doesn’t fulfill its purpose well since it’s just way too expensive. Honestly I wouldn’t even mind them axeing MORE features just to be able to sell this in a $500 range. Remove apple intelligence support, switch the screen out for a LCD screen and price it at $500, and it would’ve been a great value phone."
2025-02-20,no magsafe is ridiculous
2025-02-20,"It’s a budget phone (suppose to be)

It doesn’t need AI, 8GB Ram and A18

Put in 6GB, A17, MagSafe and give it $399 or $450"
2025-02-20,Apple reducing prices of a product? Never happened (as far as I can remember except certain specific cases) and will never ever happen in the future.
2025-02-20,"Comparing the price of a phone from 2016 doesn’t make sense. 
$399 in 2016 taking into account inflation is $528 in 2025

Even in 2016 the iPhone SE wasn’t a good value.."
2025-02-20,How much of the $599 is tariffs?
2025-02-20,"I personally would buy the 16e. I currently have a 12 and it’s showing its age these days and I’ve been wanting an upgrade for a while yet they’ve been out of my price range. I refuse to switch to android or anything other non apple products so for me the 16e is a good option.

Yes it’s one less camera, and apple intelligence is a part of it, but it’s more powerful than my 12 is. All I really need is a iPhone that is more powerful than my current iPhone and the 16e is that. I also don’t care that it isn’t MagSafe. I personally think the 16e is a good choice but could be a bit cheaper than its current price."
2025-02-20,"If you’re on an Apple subreddit, it’s likely that the iPhone 16e isn’t for you, unless you only care about the newest cheapest iPhone."
2025-02-20,It’s basically a cheaper phone for people looking at a 16 but don’t want to pay that much. Your basically getting a good chip and the iOS software nothing else
2025-02-21,"I consider 16e to be bad, because of lack of MagSafe - such a basic feature, on all iPhones and many androids for years is missing? Imagine the confusion of users trying to put the new apple iPhone on an apple holder, charger, external battery, etc… I don’t care about CPU cores count or display refresh rate, definitely not about the AI or Siri. But this is such a basic feature it should not miss, not even in a “cheap” phone. It seems they forgot what they used to say: “don’t be afraid to cannibalize between your products, because otherwise, someone other will” - MagSafe omission is clearly just an artificial measure to prevent cannibalisation with higher-end iPhones."
2025-02-21,"I think, it's main advantage on every single iphone released before, even the pro one like the 14 pro the 13 pro, is Apple intelligence and the A18 chip.

You can get an iphone 15, 11;12;13;14(pro/max), BUT, you'll not have access to Apple Intelligence. 

Just look at how updates are useless for no apple intelligence compatible phones. Since iOs 18 I've lost my excitement about updates they brought nothing new to my 13.

So I think the only selling point of this device and the message it want to pass is : 

""Apple intelligence now available on your phone at 599$. "" It's just an AI ready iPhone."
2025-02-21,Much like other Apple products it’s priced in a way that’s designed to make you consider the more expensive options the better value. It’s supposed to make you go “oh but for only x more I could get these features” and keep you climbing the ladder.
2025-02-21,I still think the first SE (and 5s) for that matter was the best looking iPhone
2025-02-21,"It’s just a marketing move. It show to users which iphone they should buy, 15 or 16, of course."
2025-02-22,"I'm interested in it for three reasons:

1. the battery life is hella good

2. $600 is like the max I wanna spend on a phone (even if the 15 is only +100 more, that's a big difference for my current financial situation)

3. It's more future proof then a 14 (14 only has 6gb of ram, 16e has 8gb) and I'm planning on using this phone until it stops getting software updates (or until it breaks)

It really isn't a great value for most people, but for my specific situation, it's not a bad deal"
2025-02-22,The people who are buying lower end phones don’t need the features that’s missing
2025-02-23,"APPLE! RELEASE A MODEL AS SMALL AS THE 13 MINI AND MY LIFE IS YOURS

Seriously I just want a small phone. I don't care if it's specs aren't up to par with the big ones, I want a phone small enough for me to type with one hand."
2025-02-23,"16e price is ridiculous, a premium price for a restricted iphone experience:
€ 720, € 850 and a whopping € 1100 for 128/256/512GB...

You better get the iphone 15 for € 709 for 128

Or you can get a Samsung S24 for € 581 or € 637 for 128/256GB.."
2025-02-23,They cut too many corners but really what makes this expensive is the new modem C1. Not only lacks 5g but also the buyers of this are tecnically beta testers 🤨
2025-02-23,">~~Apple~~ Intelligence  

Price Intelligence"
2025-02-24,"I really wish they made an budget plus iPhone but I know they won’t ever will because of their marketing scheme so that’s why I have the plus I don’t need all the fancy features, only pro iPhone I ever had was a 12 pro the battery life got so bad on it until I received my 14 plus now I have my 16 plus in blue and love it 🥰"
2025-02-24,It’s exactly how much we expected it to be
2025-02-24,"If it’s a bad value it’s a bad phone lol, Jesus Reddit logical theses days"
2025-02-24,"The thing is a lot of this stuff is just for geeks. Most people aren't bothered about wireless charging rates and ultra wide band chips. Most people ARE bothered about an extra £200 in their pocket and a better battery. The only real downside of the 16e is the worse camera hardware. I'll be looking forward to the reviews to see how that goes, but Apple's phone software has historically been good enough that I suspect the single camera won't be that big a problem. 


People need to distinguish between the sense of disappointment that it's £100 more than expected and a measurable sense of poor value for money."
2025-02-24,"Overhere in Amsterdam i got the best deal available. 
16e, one time payment €469,-"
2025-02-25,"Maybe unpopular opinion but I got a use case for it. From a managed work device perspective it is not a bad phone. I could manage it as any other iOS/iPadOS device via Apple Business Manager + Intune, and push all my compliance policies as to any other Apple devices, meeting the security requirements and audits. The price tag is nice, corporate users needs a fast, reliable phone with access to Outlook, Sharepoint, OneDrive etc. I don’t care in that scenario about  a fancy camera or MagSafe but I do care about the fact that this phone will be supported two years longer than 14 and one year longer than 15. More or less."
2025-02-25,"I’m considering the 16e as I’m in a situation not mentioned yet. Both of my Apple devices, XR and 10.5” IPad Pro (2018) are seven years old and need to be replaced as the batteries are starting to go and they are starting to show age. They have worked very well for me and look forward to more updated devices. I’m not that particular on the phone specs and what’s missing, but I do love pro motion on the iPad. So for me, saving $200 on the phone offsets the premium for a new iPad Pro."
2025-02-25,"I don't really get the bad value part. If I trade in my iPhone 14Pro for the 16e, I'm only paying 349.00 for it. And this will last much longer into the future with updates. I don't care at all about MagSafe, I've never used it..."
2025-02-25,"Respectfully, I disagree. Most of the features separating the iPhone 16E from the iPhone 16 are insignificant to most people. Granted, different people have different preferences ava priorities. Still, most of the feature differences are things people don't notice, are things people don't use much, or are new features that people have gone without in the past. The question is simply whether all of those features are worth $200. For me, they aren't even close. Considering that the iPhone 16E is supposed to have significantly better battery life than the iPhone 16, it's almost a more valuable phone for the features/specs I actually care about.

Also, for comparing to the iPhone 14 & 15, the iPhone 16E also has Apple Intelligence. This may be a divisive topic, but it is still a feature addition not present on previous models (other than 15 Pro), and I'm looking forward to having local AI processing that's private and secure. And, the iPhone 16E has nicer cameras than the iPhone 14, even if it doesn't have the Ultra Wide camera.

Perhaps you have a valid point that the iPhone 14 is a better phone at the same price point, but I think that it's a trade-off and again comes to user preference. If nothing else, the 16E will receive support for much longer than the 14, which is nice for users like myself who prefer to keep their phones for a long time."
2025-02-26,"Apple pricing is always stupid because it always works. People keep buying.

Although I think it's funny that you listed the SE series as dying, because since the 5c I have bought ONLY the SE phones. I hate how big all these damn phones have gotten, and I love my touch ID. Unfortunately even the SE line eventually killed the headphone jack, but I still consider it a better option than literally all the other iPhones out there. I have no interest in paying through the nose for crap I don't even want. Hopefully the SE series doesn't end here..."
2025-03-01,"At the very least I think it’s clean looking, I like the look. Looks like an updated 6 with the single camera. And with the squared edges of the 4 and 5."
2025-03-24,"This what I upgraded to from my 13. All my 13 cases fit it just fine and I didn’t have to spend an arm and a leg.

To me a phone is a phone tho 🤷🏼‍♀️"
2025-03-25,"I don't understand what half of these spec drawbacks mean, which probably means I'm the 16e's target market.

I am finally giving up my X \[!!!\] only because it can't accept the latest security updates and a few apps like Apple Store, need the latest versions, which is frankly more a nuisance than a deal-breaker.  Even decade-old camera technology is perfectly fine for my purposes, and all I really need is a decent amount of storage (I barely use 70GB of my current 256GB), and reasonable battery life.

So in plain non-techie language, for someone like me, is there much practical reason to get the 16 vs the 16e?"
2025-02-20,"It is a good phone. It has an insane Processor a fantastic camera and a good screen (apart from it being 60hz).

But the price just isn’t cutting it. 500€ would be adequate and a great deal but not 700€. It’s just so that they can upsell the normal 16 better. 

It won’t sell good and apple will probably kill it because of „no demand.“ on a cheap phone."
2025-02-20,Ip13Mini with A18 would be much better solution for cheaper iphone..
2025-02-20,"Its amazing in some areas, but completely unacceptable in others and that ultimately makes it a bad phone."
2025-02-20,At 499 this phone would be a steal. But you may as well just buy the 16 rather than this.
2025-02-21,Its not that bad. In Australia there is a $400 AUD price difference between the 16 and 16e and a $250 difference between the 15 and 16e. This phone would be perfect for someone like my 73 year old dad that wants a new iPhone but doesn’t care about the missing features. He sill uses a 5w charger on his iPhone 13
2025-02-21,"Even with this, all the differences are exactly what the average consumer wouldn’t care about. Even I who owns the 16 Pro Max, don’t use half the features you listed. I think this device is going to sell really well among average consumers who aren’t bothered about having the latest and greatest. They just want something that works, can take decent pics and vids, access social media and download apps etc. I also see this doing rally well in businesses. 

I really think it’s worth its price, considering it’s only $170 more than the SE which ran with well outdated hardware and design."
2025-02-20,"So happy I gave up on iPhone.

I got The CMF nothing phone for £170 and it's made me realise how stupid apple pricing is. Yes it's missing features but overall with the 16E, it's made me realise how bad their value - lowest pricing tiers are now. 

In 2025, I have met no one that uses iMessage. That leaves airdrop, don't need it. Google keep syncs notes so don't need notes. I use a MacBook and don't feel the need for an eco system at this point.

Who is this phone for though? Even for someone wanting to get into the apple ecosystem for cheap, 60hz? Jeeeez..."
2025-02-21,All apples phones are bad value. Apple’s best product remains the laptops.
2025-02-20,To be honest I don't support greedy companies anymore so glad I quit apple
2025-02-20,"Does it make sense to just throw your hands up and say ""it has one fewer GPU core than the iPhone 14""? I'm pretty sure they improved the cores of the GPU in the last three years."
2025-02-21,"I was so disappointed when I saw that price in Aus. Like seriously, at Officeworks you can get 15 for AU$170 (around US $85) more and yes, maybe not the latest chip, no action button or AI but better value overall in terms of camera, screen, features and more comparing to 16e. Apple just ripping it off completely in Aus"
2025-02-20,Is the lowest tier Mac Mini a good value? Yes. Should the lowest tier of iPhone be as well? Also yes.
2025-02-20,"I had to search what you meant with wheels. I’m beyond impressed, how can you price those at 700$?"
2025-02-20,The monitor stand and wheels are likely for businesses no? I don't think those items are really meant for regular consumers.
2025-02-20,"Every example you gave here is for their Upper tier products like the AirPods Max or the Pro Display XDR or the Mac Pro and stuff, There it is expensive for the sake of being expensive.

Here in the pretext them selling an affordable iPhone, They nerf the actual affordable line of iPhones, Increase the price of their most affordable iPhone by 50% and Remove features that in some cases were staple iPhone feature 4-5-6 years ago... That what's the outrage is about."
2025-02-20,"My mom’s on the XR right now (I bought it for her in 2019). I was looking forward to buy it for her again, but at this price a 16 is better.

I don’t know about the US, but here I can find resellers selling at lower prices than Apple’s website. And the 16 was cheaper than the 16e launching price. 

I’m going to wait a few months yet to see if the price will drop on other stores. But if the difference don’t get too significant, the 16 will be my choice."
2025-02-22,"I’m still on the XR from when it was just released. It’s showing signs of age now, and was looking to upgrade to this one. It’s more expensive then i hoped for, but i still think it’s a decent no nonsense phone which would hopefully do it’s duty for just as long as the XR did"
2025-02-27,"This was my thought exactly; the 16e + 16 = XR + XS.... no SE in that equation.

  
Some of the people I know who use the SE (newest gen each time because it's relatively affordable) work in different IT areas. They prefer function > fashion. There are other reasons but that's the short of it.

The people who went for the XR, on the other hand, were often times college students or high school seniors with part time jobs (basically, a $100 made a big difference + you were set with a decent phone experience for the next 4 or 5 years).

I feel like Apple is out of touch with who their customers are for each device type."
2025-02-20,Exactly. It’s not missing anything essential and now has the same size screen as the more expensive model. People who care about phones will still buy the Pro and those that just want “an iPhone” will buy the 16e. I’m planning on getting my parents one.
2025-02-20,You mean iPhone 45 Pro Max Ultra Slim
2025-02-21,"with a 18.7"" hyper XDR screen (it's 25Hz for cinematic experience)"
2025-02-24,icook or we cooked 😭☠️
2025-02-21,Where do you buy refurbished? Apple doesn't carry the 15 yet and the 14 refurb is basically the same price as the 16e.
2025-02-21,"This is the case at the company where I currently work. I checked today which mobile phone refresh I will get for ""free"" after 30 months using the old SE3 company phone, and it was written 16e. Hopefully it will arrive next week at my desk."
2025-02-20,"The person this phone is targeting has no idea what UWB means and definitely don’t have air tags. Reddit likes to think everything is about them but this phone isn’t. It’ll sell like hot cakes to the users who don’t care and just want a cheaper, new iPhone."
2025-02-21,"If it included all these silly little features, the 16 would be near obsolete. A $200 cheaper phone with the only compromise being lack of Dynamic Island and situationally inferior camera."
2025-02-20,"What's the actual use for UWB? I can't find any info besides helping with air tag accuracy, whatever that means."
2025-02-27,I totally agree. I know a few people who stick to the SE mainly because of the fingerprint ID.
2025-02-20,"Doesn’t make a lot of sense when they increased the prices in Europe as well, we don’t have any new tariffs. It’s 699€ here in Germany (SE3 was 519€)"
2025-02-20,They were raising prices with or without a tariff
2025-02-20,"People who defend their pricing literally have no valid reason to unless they're a shareholder. ""It's their company they can do whatever they want."" It's actually crazy how some people enjoy getting shafted for fun and think paying more for something that Apple can definitely price lower simply b/c that's demonstrating loyalty lol"
2025-02-20,"> having 1 less GPU core

And guess what? The binned A18 is still miles ahead of the A15!"
2025-02-20,"Hi, i am coming from a iphone 11 and looking at getting the 16e. Isn't the UVW chip a very important feature? If i am not wrong, it comes on my iphone 11 that released in 2019 . Would like to know how important it is !"
2025-02-20,Thank you for being the voice of reason. 99% of people dont give a shit about any of this. Go ask people if they’re content with 60hz screen or they’d rather have a 120hz and they’d look at you like youre speaking gibberish
2025-02-20,"I use the cameras all the time. My mounts are all MagSafe, especially in the car. I use UWB daily and will immediately replace my door lock with a UWB lock when that arrives. Wireless charging in the bed/car is the best. And I always control my media with the Dynamic Island. 

I can see teens (who will be getting this phone instead of the standard phone now) making use of several of these. Especially the UWB for losing things."
2025-02-20,"This is the boat i’m in as well. I have an 11 and use it to browse reddit, watch Youtube, and text friends. I just don’t understand why I’d need these other features. At least it has USB C now. I’ll probably get a 16e.

The only concern to me is if the new wifi/LTE chip is ass."
2025-02-20,"Well, if you don’t care about the trade offs, then well, the iPhone 16e is the iPhone for you? Is it a good value? No! But with longer support cycle and longer battery life in the iPhone 16 series, it might fit you just right."
2025-02-21,"Same man. Reading that “doesn’t have” list for almost all of them I’m like I don’t care. I have an iPhone 12, and pretty sure I will upgrade to the 16e"
2025-02-21,"Literally: a stupid amount. 

Of course, that's the new tarif on anything. But! At least it's an easy number to remember."
2025-02-23,"> I'm planning on using this phone until it stops getting software updates (or until it breaks)

That’s awesome. Everyone should have that mentality."
2025-02-24,A lot of people are saying this. But the 16 is 1/3 more expensive. That isn't nothing.
2025-02-22,So i'm not as much of an idiot for wanting to pay the extra $400 AUD for the extra stuff the normal 16 has. Good to know.
2025-02-20,"Yes, that’s why I call the iPhone 16e a Price Anchor."
2025-02-21,"nope, the lowest tier iPhone should be made specifically to get you to spend more"
2025-02-20,"To be fair, yes probably. But in reality, the only people I’ve seen with the wheels or the Pro Stand are consumers. Anyone I know at work or who uses one for work just tossed it on their desk or in a server room. Mostly because the company couldn’t justify that price for those pieces since they don’t really add any value, but of course a consumer can."
2025-02-20,The pretext here is most of the people buying this phone will not know or care about these missing features
2025-03-26,My 90y dad just upgraded from Galaxy Note 4 to Note 8. Would never downgrade to 16e ;)
2025-03-26,"People who care about phones will use more advanced Galaxy (eg. A55 for fraction of the price, 1TB microSD...) with real AI not iPromise ;)"
2025-02-21,"For only 500$ more, you can get the iPhone 45 *Ultra* Super Duper Slim."
2025-02-21,"I’ve gotten several refurbished for my family from both Amazon and Backmarket and it’s gone well with each.  One time I got one that was too scratched and I returned it no problem. Iphone 15 is currently $500 at those places. The sweet spot is probably the 14 pro though, $480 with essentially the 15 processor and a better camera. See:
https://www.apple.com/iphone/compare/?modelList=iphone-14-pro,iphone-15"
2025-02-21,"Ebay. Or Amazon premium renewed, comes with a 365 day return policy."
2025-02-20,"The wtf is because I have a house full of lightning cables. And, a 14 pro will suit my and my family’s needs just fine. That’s the wtf. Anything else you wanna add?"
2025-02-21,"What the hell is everyone plugging into their phones?

I haven't plugged in anything except a charger since they killed the headphone jack. 

I mean, if the wire brings in power to charge the phone: who cares if it's lightning or -c?"
2025-02-20,"I get you but this is a phone you’d buy your parents. They don’t need to know how AirTags work etc to use it, it’s just in the find my app. If you put an AirTag on your family pet or shared suitcases boom it’s useless to this phone. Definitely niche but it’s still a thing and it’s something I’m personally contemplating."
2025-02-20,"UWB lets the phone actually direct you to your AirTag with the arrows and distance indicator. Without UWB all you can see is the location on the map and play sound, this happens on iPads and iPhone X and pretty much every Apple device apart from recent iPhones, bc they don’t have UWB."
2025-02-20,"They didn’t “increase” the price in the EU just because they wanted to. No.1, the price in the USA is without tax. No.2 Apple reports in USD and with the exchange rate being ass from EUR to USD, they need to offset that cost, no thanks to the governments in the EU and their half assed policies"
2025-02-20,"If he says “things will be more expensive, you’re welcome” and so we say “well things are more expensive to import now” then that’s not politically charged. 

It’s an actual factor when you’re in a post discussing the actual costs of devices now.

If I said that the tariffs won’t actually change anything except increase the cost of living, then that’s politically charged."
2025-02-21,"same people that try to use the ""I don't care/need it"" defense

getting shades of people that defended 8gb ram in macs  
""I don't use 16gb of RAM so 8gb is enough"""
2025-02-20,"You wouldn't miss it unless you use AirTags or frequently lose your devices. It has a lot of uses in theory, but I'm pretty sure Apple only uses it to improve location tracking for stuff like AirTags and Find My. Oh and I think they might have some gimmick where your Mac can use the UWB in your iPhone to detect when you're near it and unlock itself for you.

If your only Apple device is the iPhone itself, I'm pretty sure it's just flat out worthless.

(I do think it's a neat feature, it's just not something I would ever willingly pay extra for)"
2025-02-22,"OP complain about the 16e being a ""bad value"" but it's only a bad value if you pay for features you'll never use/care. A lot of the things in the bullet points are ""nice to have"" but obviously if you want those things then pay up."
2025-02-21,"I didn’t bother reading OP’s post. I just scrolled until I found these comments. 

Some people on here are so out of touch with a large segment of iPhone buyers. I know several friends and family members who will buy this phone because it has all the features they want and is cheaper. 

Heck, they could have given it an LCD screen and gimped the phone more but it meets the needs and wants of lots of people."
2025-02-20,"You're in like, the top 10% of nerds that actually care about that stuff enough to even know it exists in the first place, set it up, maintain it, and then actively continue using it.   
  
I have to run tech support for my entire family and normal people are a lot simpler with what they want and need from a device. I call it the Alexa affect. I know a couple nerds that still use theirs daily, but everyone else eventually stopped caring within a couple months.

At this point, when it comes to iPhones, there's basically nothing normal people care about other than battery life. Everything else has more or less been satiated."
2025-02-20,Then the 16e isn’t the phone for you. If you buy and use all this shit why are you buying the lesser version of a phone? You aren’t. You’re just complaining to complain
2025-02-20,"I'd say it'd fit most people just right. I've never even seen someone with a magsafe accessory or use a wireless charger in person for example. Haven't heard anyone complain about camera quality since before the iPhone 8 probably. These are like, top 10-20% nerd features/problems that only nerds probably even know about.

Keep in mind that Apple is the king of being incredibly absurdly stingy with storage and RAM upgrades. Them being forced to give their cheaper phone the same base storage and RAM as their more ""premium"" phones to push the new AI gimmick probably hurt them on a spiritual level lol, causing them to cut more than they otherwise would've and price it higher than it otherwise should've.

If they could've gotten away with giving it 6GB of RAM and 64GB of base storage, they probably would've priced it at $450 or something."
2025-02-20,People here are WEIRD if people want to spend more for less then that on them. It’s pointless to argue with me full of pride with a phone with barebones features for a premium price. Apple is laughing to the bank. I agree with all your points. All said and done Apple’s first responsibility is to please and make shareholders money. It’s the fiduciary duty. So these things are not surprising. Just don’t buy it.
2025-02-21,Value is subjective. It’s not worth paying $100-200 more to get more features if you’re not going to use them 90% of the time
2025-02-23,"yeah, I see no point in getting the latest phone every year unless you just got a surplus of disposable income"
2025-02-22,If you see value in it then it makes sense to pay it. Personally I always get the top of the range model as I keep it for 3 years
2025-03-26,lol
2025-02-21,"Yeah I'd do that, but honestly kinda just want USBC cords. Maybe not worth it tho considering I still have an iPad with lightning. 

How big of a difference is there between the a16 and a18? Do you think the a16 will see a slowdown in the next few years? I just want to make sure it will last. I don't care about apple ai rn."
2025-02-21,Thanks!
2025-02-21,Yup.  Literally just got my mother in law an airtag on her keys and showed her how to find it on her old iPhone 12.  The UWB support is a great feature!
2025-02-21,"Also for phone as a car key UWB is useful, though not strictly necessary (some use bluetooth or NFC)"
2025-02-21,My car uses the UWB for the phone as car key in the wallet app.
2025-02-21,"THIS RIGHT HERE TY!! It's crazy to me that people will really choose against their own interests sometimes. 

The people who defend the 8GB ram in macs are the same dumbasses that justify Apple's bullshit 80% battery policy even though realistically I should be allowed get it replaced earlier if I want to. Especially if I paid for apple care. But again you have the delusional ppl that think licking Apple's boot will somehow put them next in line to become CEO"
2025-02-20,Thanks! I never use air tags : ) I am guessing i can still find an air tag with it just that the accuracy will get diminished ?
2025-02-20,"No, but I was considering that this would be a great phone for two of my aunts. And I would definitely get them AirTags and a car MagSafe dock. One of them has the SE two, or an 8, I’m not sure, but I was waiting on this phone."
2025-02-20,Ohh I’m sure it hurt them… first with 16gb ram on base model macs and not 8+128 on iPhones.
2025-02-24,"Right. Like if someone has a new phone factored into their disposable income budget for the year, sure. But practically speaking, it’s completely and utterly pointless."
2025-02-21,"If you care primarily about longevity then the 16e is the way to go. The a18 will be supported at least a couple more years than the a16, and the battery is better, and that’s the main thing that ages out. The only serious downside is the camera. Iphone 11 is lowest support now so odds are the iphone 15 gets about 4 more years of os updates, and the 16e will get at least 6 years of os updates, and maybe more if the phone stays on the market for a while (the xr released in 2018 is still running the latest os)."
2025-02-20,"Yes, so someone brought up the thing that directly affects Apple prices when specifically discussing Apple prices. It doesn’t even count as being pro/con political."
2025-02-20,"Yeah, there's just no precise location tracking. If you've ever used regular Find My before, it's like that."
2025-02-21,Yeah this is kinda what I'm thinking as well. Although I've been looking at some refurbed 15 pros as well.
2025-02-24,"Honestly, I would Never. Personally I dont care about the AI or USB-c. 

I would go so far to say that I would even pick a 13 Pro of 14 Pro over de 16e."
2025-02-24,"For many* people it’s a no brainer

Fixed that for you. I agree, it will sell well and I hope is a great option for people who can afford it but also could use that extra few hundred in their pockets. Which is many of us in this economy."
2025-02-24,Nice try apple
2025-02-24,"I think the difficulty for most is either the lack of functions while other phones do have them at a better or only little higher price (buy iPhone 16 at ""street price"" online, or literally all better Android phones) or that the price is just too high (buy refurbished, old SE or cheap to midrange Android). 

So price conscious consumer -> older Apple/refurbed/Android; tech-conscious consumer -> regular iPhone or Android. 

It's a narrow group of buyers unless there are huge discounts like what we see in the us with some carriers."
2025-02-24,It’s a fine device for people who don’t really care about specs and just use the basic features of an iPhone. Not everyone knows what MagSafe is or if there are different versions of WiFi. AT&T offers it for $6 per month (for 36 months) with no trade-in. That’s over $380 in savings.
2025-02-24,"I mean... I just bought the 16e for my mom, but I disagree with your first bullet point. My parents are boomers, and they've moved almost exclusively to wireless charging. However, they don't care about how fast it charges on the brick...

So my mom is getting an iPhone 16e with a magsafe case. She DEFINITELY cares about wireless charging, and it will be just fine for her. The huge bump in battery life from the 12 Mini to 16e will be fantastic for her too."
2025-02-25,"i’m rlly not picky with phone specs but not having the U1 chip to look for airtags and airpods like cmonnnn i need that 😭😭.. even the iphone 11 has it. also the ultra wide camera is fun for selfies with lots of fam and friends but besides those two, id love the 16e"
2025-02-25,once the discounts hit and it's on sale for $499 its going to make a killing
2025-03-07,"I’m the perfect market for the 16e. Here’s why: 

I just upgraded from the iPhone 8!!! Yes, believe it. I love the size, the colour (rose gold! Remember that trend? ) and the home button and would have kept it if Apple didn’t stop support. In between the 8 I purchased the 12 mini on a plan. From day one that thing was giving me problems. Terrible sound, terrible battery, overheating, the first one was damaged out of the box and I had to get a replacement. An Apple devotee since 2010, it was the first time an Apple product had disappointed me. 
In 2024 I wanted to upgrade and thought it best to get the best phone available so bought the 15pro max. But it was way too big for me and performance-wise I wasn’t blown away so I sold it! By then my 12 mini screen wasn’t working and I gave up on it. Still went back to the 8! It’s been working perfectly, doing everything I need.  Even though I had to charge it 4 times a day lol. 
Was considering maybe the 2022se but heard a new one was coming out so held on. 
Was disappointed to find the new one wasn’t an SE anymore and did away with home button, ring silent switch and lightning. 
The SE2022 is $700(ish)AUD and the 2025 16e is $999AUD so it made sense! And I’m happy with it"
2025-02-24,"A lack of an Ultra Wide camera is a dealbreaker to me, for I love photography as a hobby"
2025-02-24,It’s not a bad phone. It just has some very perplexing omissions.
2025-02-24,"I’m torn between a new 14 for 628 Euros, a new 15 for 730 Euros or the 16e for 699 Euros. MagSafe, AI, Ultrawide and Dynamic Island are not important. What do you think is best?"
2025-02-24,I’d basically consider buying this for my parents or kids.
2025-02-24,"I get the top of the line iPhone, have since the 7 Plus. Granted, since they started having 3 cameras my need for all the features has diminished. I could honestly do with 1 camera and that’s just for the rare time I take a photo. MagSafe is a must, as I’ve invested a lot of money into it, $150 for a Belkin 3 in 1 charging stand. Not to mention my car mount which was $5 but I’ll go down in a hail of bullets to keep it safe. Literally so useful and by far my favorite car mount I’ve ever had, and there’s been quite a few."
2025-02-24,Here’s why not. The primary function of a phone is connecting to mobile networks. If that isn’t good. Then you may as well through the phone in the bin. I would never risk money buying a device with a radio that is an unknown quantity. Just go over to the pixel sub and see the shitshow that has been for the last 4 generations because of not using a Qualcomm radio.
2025-02-24,I am still using my 12 Pro Max and it has 85% battery health and i will keep this phone till i can’t use it anymore and everything and will be getting a new battery for it in July or somewhere around there
2025-02-24,"The only thing I will disagree with you on is MagSafe argument, though granted not the wireless charging aspect of it but with not having it (at least to our knowledge) there will be no magnets. Most of us that care about MagSafe has hardly anything to do with the wireless charging aspect but those magnets that have allow us to use our phones more ways especially if you can just slap on a magnetic accessory on the back of the phone.

Anyway besides that yes most common people would not care or know to much stuff about these sort of things."
2025-02-24,"I'm coming from a SE2000.

* you don't use wireless charging, let alone magsafe accessories. Let's face it, most people don't, and those who do are probably using Pro line phones.
* Currently don't have but both seem to have been around a while a I see people use them. Given my next phone will be with me for 4/5 years I was hoping for it.



* you don't know what a GPU is or why you need an extra one. That's basically all of us.
* I agree.



* you do want better battery life. That's definitely all of us.
* I agree.



* you're relaxed about having all the latest camera bells and whistles. Iphones have been producing the best phone pictures in the business from not-the-best hardware for generations. Will it be as good as the 16 pro? No. Will it be good enough? Probably. And finally...
* I was hoping for a wide camera. I had one on a pixel A from 5 years ago which cost under $500.



* you want £200. £200, people! That's a lot of money to spend on something else.
* I was hoping to save more!

  
You see the 16e for people stepping down from base models. A lot will be stepping up from SE or android."
2025-02-24,"When Iphone has been putting magsafe for the last 6 years, it should be standard now.. Also not having find my device and C1 not supporting wide bands.. its a very bad deal. I just cant wait to see all apple phones having 120hz display.. Makes so much difference with that cpu.."
2025-02-24,"I will certainly get it once it has dropped in price a little. Clean design, good camera, face id, USB-C, A18, everything I need in an iPhone. I don’t care about magsafe or wireless charge. Right now in my location I can get it for $200 off from my carrier when signing a 2 year contract. It’s a decent deal but I’ll wait since my current phone still works."
2025-02-24,You’re a procurement manager and need to bulk buy a bunch of phones for the company.
2025-02-25,"Because it isn’t a budget phone at that price. It is like the iPhone 5c. The reason why the SE when it released it had a up to date guts, but the price squarely puts it at a budget entry level iPhone into the ecosystem."
2025-02-25,"Since phones are lasting much longer these days, you’re better off picking up an older model with more features for the same price. I’d rather have a second-hand 15 Pro in good condition (like I’m still using currently) than a 16E."
2025-02-25,On Friday I bought a used 15 pro 256gb for $650 instead of a new 16e 256gb for $700. Because I figured I might as well have more phone for less money.
2025-02-25,"I use magsafe in my car, on my nightstand and with an Apple Wallet in my pocket. Using a iPhone 13 mini, there is no reason to think only Pro phone buyers would use magsafe.

But magsafe on the 16e can easily be fixed with a phone case

iPhone photos with the stock app are terrible to be honest, too much processing going on and with every new iPhone it seems to be getting worse."
2025-02-25,"My dad is one of those that always want the latest and greatest.  He was jonesing for a 16 but, as I control the finances, I compromised and got him a 15+.  We had the money to buy it outright instead of financing it through AT&T and pay triple the sticker price over the next 4 years. I, personally, have a 12 pro and I'm happy with it.  I don't need the highest res, the most storage space, etc.  Some day it will die then I'll get a new one.  I have a certain amount of savings towards being able to buy my new one outright when that day comes."
2025-02-26,"I've decided to just wait until this Oct, expecting to have some discounts. If it doesn't happen then I'll get something else."
2025-02-27,"I have the iPhone SE 2020 bought brand new.  I've been waiting for the next iteration of iPhone's to have USB c before I upgraded.  The SE's have consistently run $399-$429.  I don't care about mag safe, but I'm not paying $600 bucks for a iPhone I'd rather wait a year and pick up a iPhone 15 on the used market which will still have the USB C and should get updates for 5-6 years after I buy it.  It's.quite disappointing to see the iPhone 16e price point."
2025-03-03,If I want the newest iPhone for a little cheaper than 16 but I have an se3 and it goes well I don’t need ai download an app for ai and usb-c like why I have only lightning so I won’t get it unless less than 400$
2025-03-08,"100% agree and my thought process in deciding to get it. I had the 16 pro for a week before I got sick of how heavy it is and scratching my head trying to figure out the upgrades from my old iPhone 14 that I gave to my little brother (otherwise I would still have it): also the battery drained surprisingly quick, more than my old 14. So far this 16e has best battery life in any phone I’ve ever had including the 16 pro. Also, what a relief on my hand. I love how light it is. The 16 pro felt like I was holding a brick. Couldn’t be happier!"
2025-03-19,"I upgraded from my 11 pro max to the 16e and I’m happy with my iPhone 16e. Everyone is all triggered about frankly useless features they’ll never use that are missing from the 16e. It’s fast, has 5G and has stellar battery life. As far as the 60hz vs 120hz goes for the screen. I don’t want/ need my phone to be a gaming pc lol. It’s the newest iPhone and it’s getting flack for actually being a decent phone that actualy feels like it pays homage to the iPhone 5. Which was the last iPhone Steve Jobs was involved with. It’s got one really good camera and is sleek. I don’t get the hate."
2025-03-21,I love my 16e
2025-02-24,"I think the 16e is a tribute to the past, it look like an iphone 4s.

Is an iPhone without whistle and bell, essential, that cover all the basic.

Good battery life, usb C, decent camera, action button, you can still use magsafe with a case.

It is a phone, is not meant to replace your camera or gaming console.

And again is history repeating itself, same as for the iphone 5c and XR, lots of critics when came out but after couple of months when price settles down ... best buy."
2025-02-24,"Unless your service provider is offering an upgrade for about $50 then you’ll be saving nearly the full price of the phone, so why not go with the regular model"
2025-02-24,Noooooooooo
2025-02-24,The deal breaker is the C1 not supporting ultra wideband.
2025-02-24,Better battery life? It literally doesn't last long for them 🤣
2025-02-24,"You literally could not be more off base.  
  
I don't use wireless charging?  I use it literally every day for my current phone and both my personal and work headsets.  
  
I don't know what a GPU is?  Brother I personally built last four computers.   
  
I want $200? How about I want $800 I can save by not buying a phone?  Maybe if it was appropriately I'd be willing to spend $429 on it, but at that price I'd rather buy the iPhone 16 and in that case I'd rather just not buy a new phone."
2025-02-25,apple marketting team is really now resorting to shilling on reddit to boost sales?

2025-02-24,Did I across a portal to another dimension? Can't believe anyone actually considers this phone as a good deal xd
2025-02-24,sounds like an iphone 7 with face id.. i‘m in!
2025-02-25,This is a great point.
2025-02-24,prepare for ugly antenna lines though
2025-02-24,Ye I aint paying 750€ for 60hz phone
2025-02-26,"Why the fuck would you buy a 13 instead of a 16e? That’s utterly psychotic and irrational, unless you’re getting it dirt cheap used. But to pretend it’s a better phone is insane."
2025-02-24,I mean thats not even a question
2025-03-02,"It becomes a no brainer when you can switch to a budget carrier and bring your own device. Apple is paying me $250 credit for my old iPhone 13 which I got for free 3 years ago from T-Mobile. So it only costs me a purchase price of the 16e net of that credit. I’m paying $17.50 a month up front for a year on US Mobile and getting ridiculous speeds. So I will have the newest phone on a budget and the cost of the phone will be amortized by the end of the year. For me, getting a new device every 3-4 years is ideal unless there is a great opportunity out there."
2025-03-18,and are people not considering trading in their phone?? Or getting a better deal from their cellular plan like T mobile???
2025-02-24,"Because the price is much worse in other parts of the world than in the US. In EU, its currently less than $100 price difference between 16 and 16e. Before it was about $350 between 16 and SE3, which was more of either features or price. In turkey, the iPhone 16e seems to be about $1300 USD. In emerging markets like India, it's nearly $800. 

So, before Apple had an option for price conscious consumers who wanted an iPhone but didn't want to spend plus $500. This is now gone and I am assuming will be for a long time."
2025-02-25,It's not specs It's cost.
2025-02-25,"Here in the UK refurbed iphones are really not that much cheaper than new. 10% maybe? And then you may not have confidence in the battery (amazon for example guarantees at least 80% battery health - great!) and the discount on last year's model isn't what it should be either. Apple policy, no doubt."
2025-03-12,$6 a month for 36 months seems like a solid deal!
2025-03-18,"android nerds after I tell them I just want a regular phone that I can do basic shit with, not needing their bullshit features"
2025-02-25,"Correct me if I’m wrong, but having a MagSafe case on the 16e still won’t allow it to wirelessly charge, right? Cause the 16e doesn’t have MagSafe abilities built into it."
2025-02-26,How’s reception antenna since was in house ?
2025-02-24,"The thing is carriers are selling the 15 for the same amount or even with a better deal as they're trying to get rid of that older stock. For the same money you get the additional wide angle camera which can do macro shots as well, and all those missing things that you probably don't use at the moment, Magsafe, precise location, but also things you might appreciate like a newer and brighter display. The main thing missing is Apple's AI. It also has the mute switch that your 13 has if you like that more than the new button.

Maybe you still prefer the 16E overall, but isn't it odd that the 15 from 2023 is still available yet has somewhat better hardware than a 2025 iPhone in the 16 lineup?

Imagine if you came from your 13 with a magsafe bedside charging stand and you just assumed that a 16E in 2025 will obviously work with it as well, as Apple didn't even mention the lack of Magsafe support. Many customers will come from an iPhone 12 or 13 with Magsafe accessoires and they will only find out the mistake after buying it and realizing they can't put it on the charge stand.

The 16E is a very strange iPhone in that it's a 16 lineup iPhone yet doesn't support some of the core iPhone experiences that your older 13 supported just fine. Oh and the best part in the comparison between your 13 and the 16E? The displays are identical. I understand it's not really that important, but modern displays literally get twice as bright nowadays to be better readable in the sun and then Apple sells you the same display you bought with your 13 in 2021.

Coming from the 13 is an odd spot as well. The 15 isn't that much better, the 16E has minor improvements in some areas but is partly even worse, and a 16 is expensive where you can get a used 15 Pro with AI for the same price."
2025-02-26,Carrier cheap enough month
2025-03-08,"wow same here haha, upgraded from the iPhone 8+. been with me for many years but I was getting tired of the battery and didn't want to replace it every 1-2 ears. 

i am enjoying my 16e. i mainly wish it had 120hz (really the only feature that I wanted, but I was always on low battery mode on my 8, so it was practically always 30hz. maybe in 5 years ill go up to 120 when everyone is on 240). i also wish it was like $200 cheaper. but barring dropping it down a ditch, I expect to use this for the next 5 years +"
2025-03-16,"Well i have the iphone 7.
There’s a deal in EU, i can get the 16e at 599€.
My old trusty iphone 7 lasted nearly 8 years ! 
Would you recommend pushing the trigger ?"
2025-02-26,Most don’t it’s cat pictures for Facebook lol
2025-02-24,I think the omissions are pretty mild to be honest.
2025-02-26,16e
2025-02-24,So the 5c received mixed comments and was commercially less successful than other iPhones of that time.
2025-02-24,and you use that for what?
2025-02-24,After 3.5 years my iPhone battery is at 79% capacity. Could be worse; I think it is holding up well
2025-02-24,"I think what he was implying was that you‘re not the target market for the 16E. The target market is for the people who fit his list, not the people who fit yours, right?"
2025-02-24,"Wireless charging will still work, right? The charger will simply not stick to the phone (no magnets) and it will be slow is what I understand. Not saying that I like this - my 13 Mini does have Magsafe and I don't want to downgrade"
2025-02-24,"> iphone 7

The last phone I enjoyed before I went down the rabbit hole of phone reviews, comparing specs etc."
2025-02-25,"iPhone 7 has wireless charging though, no?"
2025-03-16,"And at 599€ ? 
There is a deal on Rakuten right now in EU and i need to ditch my old Iphone 7 😅
What would you do if you were me ?"
2025-02-26,13 PRO or 14 PRO.
2025-02-24,"For some, it is."
2025-02-25,"Ah ok. In mainland EU (e.g. Germany, Spain), often there are good offers for iPhones from smaller web shops or on eBay where there are some limited quantities at very good prices - new and sealed. Even on Amazon you get a new iPhone usually for 10-13% less money than directly from Apple. The A3287 (international model iPhone 16) for UK and the EU is the same model, so maybe buying in the EU makes sense."
2025-02-25,"That's what I thought at first too, but it's not right. 16e has Qi wireless charging. If you get a case with magsafe magnets, it will still charge on a magsafe charger, just at 7.5W. if you search on Amazon, you can see a bunch of 16e cases available with magsafe."
2025-02-26,Just use normal wireless charger why MagSafe
2025-02-26,Doesn't come out for a few days
2025-03-12,RIP iPhone 8 lol
2025-03-17,I like it! Performance wise it’s a huge upgrade!
2025-02-24,"Depending on what other Apple accessories you have, the lack of an ultrawide band and MagSafe are pretty big omissions. You’re getting a substandard experience with some of Apple‘s own fairly cheap accessories."
2025-02-24,"Of course because was not the flagship and the difference from the 5s was only 100$, but got depreciated quite fast."
2025-02-24,"Or I'll stick with my 5 year old S20FE which has 15w wireless charging, 120hz and an ultra wide camera.

Edit:  
Apple Fanboys salty that a 5 year old phone you can get for $160 has a better display, faster wireless charging, an ultrawide camera and two more cameras than their brand new $600 phone."
2025-02-25,I love my 7 since it’s all metal
2025-02-25,Nope. Wireless charging was introduced with the 8/X.
2025-03-16,"Yee thats decent price, but me personally I dont like 60hz"
2025-03-19,"That’s what I’m saying, it’s a good and reliable phone. It’s not meant to be a rocket ship. It literally says on the page that it’s “built to last” not “built to fly”."
2025-02-25,"Oh, interesting. Well, I feel like most people get cases for their phones anyway so this issue isn’t really a big deal for the most part, asides from the slower charging time. Good to know."
2025-02-26,Ok then we know re if it has antenna gate
2025-02-24,I’m someone that isn’t very immersed in the Apple ecosystem so the phone checks most boxes for me. Price is probably the biggest problem but I managed to get a discounted preorder rather than order directly from Apple.
2025-02-24,"Up until the announcement of the 16e I had never heard of magsafe. I like the idea of wireless charging but it's not something I would use frequently.

Whats the ultra wide band for?"
2025-02-25,You are correct. I must've mixed them up since I skipped that generation (upgraded from 6S to X)
2025-02-25,"totally. I got it for my mom, and it was announced with magsafe, I was pissed because we would have to figure something out, and I wanted her to get the newest SoC. Once I saw it had Qi and we got a magsafe case, I was fine w/ it. Still sucks they took it out, but my mom can live with 7.5W charging and never notice."
2025-02-24,Ultra Wideband is used for precise location tracking for things like AirTags.
2025-02-24,Same. Coming from iphoneSE so all these missing features i’ve never known about.
2025-02-24,"Magsafe is nice for stuff like phone stands and whatnot, and it also helps line the phone up on a wireless charger. I like the wireless charging but you kinda have to lean into it to get the most out of it (buying the chargers, mostly). Nice to be able to just set my phone on my desk or nightstand and have it start charging."
2025-02-26,I can use it on S23 never bothered
