2024-09-14,I haven‚Äôt really been following the AVP. Was there ever any games released for it?
2024-09-14,"When AVP came out almost every review panned it's lack of apps, functionality and general lack of things to do..... but they all ended on a positive assured we could ""trust apple"" to continue developing a wide array of software for it to overcome those deficiencies. Most even veered into fantasyland speculating what those new experiences might entail.

Its now been over half a year since release... did that come true? Or did they just port over phone apps with zero VR/MR functionality?"
2024-09-14,One plays games the other doesn'tüò©
2024-09-14,Was price a factor?  Or would MQ3 still reign supreme if they were equal?
2024-09-14,"I'm excited to use the Davinci Eye app which I just tested tonight. You can't use an app like that on Quest because the pass through is far too distorted.  So that's one thing, but honestly it's the thing I was the most excited about because I want to turn some of my digital art into real paintings by projecting the digital drawings on a canvas in AR then get to painting."
2024-09-14,"I actually did opposite as I saw myself using Quest 3 for 80% media consumption, at night in bed with wifey going to sleep. The rest was a bit of gaming and whatever else.

Having tried the Vision Pro for couple weeks I was so impressed by it's displays, it's UI and overall build and polish of the device. Just loved it. I don't wanna use LCD displays again I'll tell you that! It's giving me the home theater I could never get. And the wife...wow did she impress me how much she loved it too lol.

So we made decision we getting AVP, and selling Quest and few other things to save up for like new used Avp. And I factored the price and Quest 3 512GB with all my accessories...was close to $1k. And the AvP will get on used market now I can see $2-$2.5k.

So it's not the huge 7x jump price difference that I always see....for me it's much less and much more worth it.

If I was all in on gaming it be different but I'm not. And also there's a good chance AvP is getting some nice third party controllers soon, which will work great with my beast laptop for steamvr."
2024-09-14,"if you have a PC you can use the Vision Pro as a steamVR headset using ALVR, definitley worth trying it if you haven‚Äôt already"
2024-09-14,"I have both devices. I use the AVP for watching movies and working, and the Quest 3 for gaming."
2024-09-15,"Yup, we create apps for companies and between AVP and Meta3 its always the Meta3 that wins. Not just on cost but all round use"
2024-09-14,"I also have both and I‚Äôm not really sure on what they are being compared. Quest 3 has virtually almost no apps compatibility and the OS is such a pixelated and limited mess that I wouldn‚Äôt even know where to start. If you are thinking of VR, then yes Quest 3 is still the absolute king!

But sentences like ‚Äúthey are not much different‚Äù, sorry that‚Äôs really untrue for anybody that doesn‚Äôt know apple vision pro. 

They are miles apart, on both sides. Comfort wise Quest 3 is head on miles ahead. Gaming wise Quest 3 also is further and further away from what you have on AVP, which is almost ridiculous given its capabilities.

But, for anything else, from entertainment to productivity, or basic app‚Äôs availability and personal browsing, AVP is just like an iPad or any other smartphone, while Quest 3 is like a PS5, you can do some of these things, but not well, with poor quality UI, little apps availability unless you like to temper with a terminal or SideQuest and alternative who knows owned by whom stores, and without any of your preferences (i.e. password management). Plus, way less freedom on your window management (which they recently added but couldn‚Äôt bother to do it decently).

The 2 have very good things to be praised about and very evident flaws, but there is almost no overlap, they are clearly thought for different use cases. AVP will unlikely be a gaming machine any time soon even if you add controllers, and Quest 3 will not probably be a smartphone replacement even with windows management cause you‚Äôre missing a very basic thing that won‚Äôt ever come (due to google not being on board): a google account that holds your information and can provide features you normally expect on any android device (proper app store, your standard mail and calendar utility apps, password management and any other profile preference)."
2024-09-14,"One is packed with tech, and the other one has the content haha"
2024-09-14,"I feel the AVP's form factor and weight just don't support its use case yet. I'd love to use MR for watching movies, work and for playing some games on a giant screen... but not with a big, hot and heavy 600g brick on my face.


I'm sure we'll be there with standalone MR goggles in a few years. But right now the best use case for MR hmds is still active VR/MR (sports, gaming, etc.)."
2024-09-14,"Yeah the Vision Pro is a pretty fantastic piece of hardware. Software is even pretty damn good too. To me it‚Äôs just too cumbersome. I also wish I could log into multiple apple accounts on it. Specifically so I can use it as a second display for my work laptop without messing with remote  desktop apps.

It‚Äôs very impressive how far the quest os has come in just the last few months. A quest 4 would not even need to match the resolution to blow the Vision Pro out of the water.

I‚Äôm out of the return window for the Vision Pro so I guess I‚Äôm keeping mine. I bought it to experiment with porting some prototype apps I wrote for the quest that didn‚Äôt work great with the limited resolution."
2024-09-14,How is the lens quality between the two? Does AVP have comparable edge to edge clarity?
2024-09-14,Do you do work with a MacBook or stream 2D games from a PlayStation or PC? That‚Äôs a huge chunk of the usefulness of the AVP and its superior fidelity. I work about 4-6 hours a day in mine.
2024-09-14,"I have a friend who has the AVP, and he let me try it out for a bit. 

As a Quest 3 PCVR enjoyer, I can tell you confidently that it is worth about $600-$700 at MOST."
2024-09-14,"Interesting to read your comments.¬†


I got to demo the AVP at Apple store covent garden London¬†


The demo was neat but the device didn't provide a ""wow"" moment, probably been spoiled by using a 35ppd PCVR headset with powerful gaming PC and lighthouse tracking.¬†


Haven't thought about AVP since the demo which is weird considering I love trying out new technology"
2024-09-14,Thr vision pro does vr gaming? I thought it just augments thw world around you
2024-09-14,"AVP isn‚Äôt advertised for watching movies, or vr."
2024-09-15,Next up - Apple vision air VS. Meta 3S üòÅüòÅüòÅ
2024-11-10,"Apple Vision Pro is clearly better imo, but obviously quest is purposely not as good so it can be affordable. AVP resolution needs to be standard at around the price of an Ipad pro. Thats when the industry will take off."
2024-11-11,"For me it was quite the opposite. I have AVP and PSVR2. I really thought I was missing something but I was wrong. Quest 3 is a major reduction in every way possible. AVP rules in MR and PSVR takes lead in gaming quality. The only thing Q3 has is a bigger library, but what good is it when it‚Äôs subpar. I‚Äôm returning Q3 immediately."
2024-11-12,3500$ you can buy superb computer with big 4K screen. Wouldnt that be better for productivity?
2024-11-29,"wish quest3 has eye tracking so the hand tracking can actually work.  
wish quest3 put half of the weight on my belt instead of all on the head, it feels heavy.  
wish quest3 has 5G phone capability.  
Also quest3 cannot be used outdoor ... so as productivity device AVP is still better but really does not worth the price yet.  
wish AVP has 5G, wish AVP does not use the heavy material to just make it feels expensive.

Actually if quest3 put the quest pro's eye tracking into it and make it 100% more expensive should still be a better choice than AVP."
2024-12-05,for gaming and less cost the meta quest wins easily.
2024-12-26,"This is an odd comparison. Mostly because the Quest is a VR toy with open-source code and components that Meta does not make. The M3 chip is light years more efficient ahead of Snap Dragon. The displays are lightyears better, with Spatial audio, and just the overall power lol. Apple has the best devs in the world. Just because AVP does not have games is a moronic argument. Quest will never have an enterprise application because it's a toy. Apple clearly has  a different plan to capture that market first. I would rather watch the Superbowl and other sports in spatial form then play games lol .I would rather have actual life-like experiences than play ping-pong with a whale. AVP has a level of realism Quest will never ,which is why it is 299$ LOL."
2025-01-16,No chance Meta wins. I have both AVP and Quest3. When I tried the AVP ‚Ä¶. I could see how it will shape the future of immersive video entertainment. The quest is like a useless toy‚Ä¶ games suck‚Ä¶ videos suck. It‚Äôs like an expensive version of 3d glasses‚Ä¶ with horrible user experience. AVP is like being at the Sphere in Vegas. If you have ever wondered what it would feel like when video got so good it feels like your there‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs how I would describe the AVP.
2024-09-14,Are we really comparing two products one of which costs 7 times the other? :O
2024-09-14,Just wish the quest had eye tracking and was like $500 more premium
2024-09-14,"The one have controllers, are for playing and cost 7 times less. The other is for fing applef4gs and absolutely useless."
2024-09-14,"Does your projector do HDR? Mine does, but if I didn't already have a big ass DV supported OLED I might have bought one - especially if I traveled more. 

AVP is currently one of the only headsets that you can watch Dolby Vision HDR on OLED - no other experience comes close for image quality. They have other OLED headsets, but none can do DV, which is a big deal for me."
2024-09-14,AVP is more of an entertainment-consuming device. I feel like it is a VR iPad. It only has some simple games you can play with an iPad or iPhone. No ways it is comparable to Quest 3 in gaming.
2024-09-14,There are some VR games but nothing too crazy. You can also use ALVR to play steamVR games as long as you have controllers/base stations etc. With the new Surreal controllers playing steamVR games will get simpler. Now the thing is to get the best quality posible you have to buy the developer strap ($300) and the new controllers are $250. At that point you just get a Quest 3 IF all you care is gaming.
2024-09-14,"I own the AVP.  Hardware is cool but software really did feel like an unfinished dev kit. 

In Apple‚Äôs defense‚Ä¶. Where is the competing hardware from any other tech giant?  

I caved and bought one cause I feel like it‚Äôll be 2026, 2027, or later before I can buy a competing device.  Maybe in that time the software catches up."
2024-09-14,Supposedly there might be some ports from Quest with support for the third party motion controllers that were recently Kickstartered.
2024-09-14,The few games that are on there and on Quest 3 run like shit. Synth Riders for example.
2024-09-14,Alien Vs. Predator!
2024-09-14,Job Simulator and Vacation Simulator
2024-09-14,"A ton actually: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Alien,\_Predator,\_and\_Alien\_vs.\_Predator\_games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Alien,_Predator,_and_Alien_vs._Predator_games)"
2024-09-14,Job simulator my beloved
2024-09-15,"there are actually have been a bunch of app releases but interestingly they seem to be mostly falling flat and not generating much hype. I'm not sure if it's the tiny user base just can't organically do it, or if there's something about the apps. A bunch of the early apps really sucked either because of half assed implementations (see [demeo with no MR and sucky graphics](https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1cz0llx/demeo_game_available_on_apple_vision_pro/) ), but also because Apple inexplicably drastically limited the fidelity of hand tracking in 3rd party apps, which pretty much killed any kind of action game.

So it seems to me a combo of small user base, lack of commitment from app devs (which could be the small user base, but I really wonder why Apple did not directly fund a bunch of marquee apps - arrogance?), and some self inflicted wounds by Apple, have all led to a much less successful launch than could have been the case.

I actually feel like Apple is truly playing the long game here and genuinely felt they actively didn't want to hype it up while they were supply limited. But the result is an unfortunate perception that it's a flop."
2024-09-14,"Yes, you run apps just like you do on a laptop or phone. That‚Äôs what is purpose is and it does it brilliantly. To be useful you need more standard every day apps and less vr specific immersive experiences. Apart from games, vr experiences are fun for a few minutes, they are far from average consumers do every day with technology‚Ä¶ Having most of the apps you use every day on any other device, now that‚Äôs the thing that matters mostly, and we‚Äôre not fully there, it needs a cheaper line and a proper non gaming android competitor to get good market share for devs to care. 3D and immersive will then probably come, but you first need a market that is big enough, and you won‚Äôt get one if XR devices keep being 3D / immersive / VR / AR only, they need to do what we do already daily PLUS all that on top, as people are not going to spend even 1k on a device that does 1 thing only they might not even care for (vr is not at all that interesting to most people, it‚Äôs still a niche, and I say this while I own 3 headsets, so not bashing, just saying what‚Äôs pretty much in everyone sight to see)."
2024-09-14,"6 months feels like a very short time to expect major changes. I agree the software is still sorely lacking, but I don't expect this to be really remedied for quite some time. 

It's an amazing platform though, I really hope Apple starts to throw their weight into first party applications that show its potential. If they abandoned the project it would be a huge waste and a massive blow for AR/VR."
2024-09-14,I can tell you don‚Äôt follow their updates.
2024-09-14,"Yeah, one is a gaming console, the other a generic purpose mobile device‚Ä¶"
2024-09-14,"Prices are absolutely a contributing factor to the battle. But I bought the AVP to explore what else it can do that the Quest 3 cannot. Also, I was hyped up with its visual quality, sleek design, and intuitive hands and eye tracking. But that faded quickly after the first few days. I don‚Äôt know what to do with it except watch movies or create a VR workspace, which the Quest 3 can also do. AVP is absolutely a high-end VR headset that makes you wow at first. But it is just not that functional. There are many things AVP can't do, but Quest 3 can. Quest 3 can do much more (gaming, working out, productivity, entertainment) with a slightly lower resolution. So, I think Quest 3 is still the best choice, even if you don't care about the prices. Maybe I will save that money for the next generations of Quest 4 or AVP2."
2024-09-14,"I agree AVP will be the best for some designesr, artists or app delevopers. But for me it is pretty just a toy. üòÖ"
2024-09-14,"What's weird is right before dusk as the sun goes behind this giant hill by my house, if I walk outside with passthrough on, the Q3 is insanely clear. Obviously AVP would trump it even in bad lighting but I do wish it could look like that at all times. Guess it's just not avaliable at the price range yet. Hopefully 2026"
2024-09-14,"Same here, I have a Quest 3 and a PSVR2, tried AVP, bought one, use it for pretty much most of what I do with technology, including 4k gaming streaming from my gaming pc, not going back to other headsets until there‚Äôs a VR game I like (so far not seeing any unfortunately)‚Ä¶"
2024-09-29,Same here. I feel like the Quest 3 will ultimately be a gaming/social media device and the AVP will be the productivity device. No one will be editing a feature film on the Quest 3 but I can absolutely see that happening down the road with the AVP.
2024-09-14,"I have both vision pro and a high end PC‚Ä¶.  

It‚Äôs such a project.  You really gotta tweak the ALVR settings to take advantage of your Vision Pro and then getting a legit pair of VR controllers to work with it is a serious project. 

I‚Äôm actually still working on the latter today. It‚Äôs borderline unusable without it. I don‚Äôt like it being passed around as a solution for a regular guy. 

For me I‚Äôm building a VR game and desperately wanted to see it on the Vision Pro so it‚Äôs borderline worth it.  But if not for that I‚Äôd have given up."
2024-09-15,I am considering keeping it as a movie-watching device because the experience of watching cinema-like quality movies on the moon is so cool. But it is a bit uncomfortable and lonely. I would love to use my projector instead.
2024-09-14,"Well, I‚Äôd argue that content still lies in everyday apps, which availability is way larger on AVP than Quest."
2024-09-14,Annapro
2024-09-14,It already has en external battery. They could‚Äôve moved all hardware there also to make it light and compact af but they didn‚Äôt ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2024-09-14,"I only tried the Vision Pro in the Apple Store in London (they don‚Äôt sell in my country yet) and was impressed. I have Valve Index for gaming and I‚Äôm quite happy with it (I know there might be better options today) and this was, in terms of visual quality, miles ahead. Problem was - if I bought it, I have no idea what I would be doing with it. I mean yeah, I could watch movies, but there isn‚Äôt any killer app I would buy it for. I bought the Index because of HL: Alex and it was well worth it, but there‚Äôs nothing like that for me on the Vision Pro. If someone figured out a way to play HL: Alyx on it‚Ä¶ (ideally by using Valve Index controls), that‚Äôd be another story, but there are so many obstacles to do that. Something else must appear for me to go for it."
2024-09-14,"The only negative I can say about the Vision Pros visuals is maybe a bit of glare in certain situations (and maybe a desire for more FOV).  It‚Äôs nothing like a bigscreen beyond where the sweet spot is teeny tiny.  

Way closer to Quest 3 where the whole lens feels like a sweet spot.  There is a problem where the whole input system is based on eye-tracking and if the headset isn‚Äôt in the rifht spot that can be affected negatively."
2024-09-14,You still can‚Äôt watch HDR content actually. The max brightness of AVP displays is not nearly enough
2024-09-14,Crazy seeing the pricepoint is 5x the Quest. Gaming is one of the main reasons to get a VR setup
2024-09-14,AVP is more a money-consuming device with no real purpose behind that would justify the amount spent üòÖ
2024-09-14,Seems like a missed opportunity but I guess it‚Äôs a different market
2024-09-14,"Have they even released any new entertainment content for it? 

3D movies are nice but I think it‚Äôs a massive dropped ball not to create VR180 content or have immersive live sporting events. Apple is one of the few who could have pulled it off."
2024-09-14,Play them in 2d? What would be the point? I‚Äôd much rather just play them on my pc with no sweaty headset on my face
2024-09-14,"Well I mean since Oculus is owned by Facebook it is the competing hardware from a tech Giant, and it offers significantly more for a significantly lower price, unless stuff like the face passthrough is that big of a game changer"
2024-09-14,Can you? Was it the way I blatantly asked about it?
2024-09-16,"If you're using it for mainly apps and productivity and not worried about 3d or immersion there are way cheaper and better form factor technologies out there like video glasses.  Sure, the res is not on par with the AVP but in a couple of generations they may be at a 10th of the price."
2024-09-14,"It‚Äôs only until you stream your pc desktop to the headsets you will realize how much difference in resolution between the two. One is usable as monitor replacement the other, not even close."
2024-09-14,"It would be interesting to get your perspective of the PSVR2 compared to the AVP, in regards to blacks, contrasting colors. Personally I'm a bit suprised based on your review or opinion that you never mentioned the warm, contrasting colors or the clarity of the display in dark scenes compared to the Quest 3."
2024-09-14,Millions of Android apps run natively on Meta Quest. It's an open ecosystem where Meta actually encourages 3rd party stores and sideloading. You can install anything from Retroarch to Microsoft Office.
2024-09-14,"The killer app thing won‚Äôt ever be there cause it‚Äôs a fad. AVP is a general purpose device, just like an iPad or iPhone or a laptop, there is no need for a killer app cause it‚Äôs not meant for 1 purpose only. You might enjoy it for work, or simply navigating or entertainment. It depends on what you do with technology. I think the problem is comparing it with a VR headset which is meant for one purpose only. 

AVP is not that type of device. You get one, you use it like your phone or tablet, it‚Äôs actually super simple to get value out of it. I use it 8 hours a day almost, and almost forgot about my iPad and my phone!"
2024-09-14,"This is a silly claim about not being bright enough HDR when it's a completely sealed off headset and is it not DV certified? What you're thinking of as min required brightness is to accommodate viewing spaces where there is no light control like living rooms with windows, etc."
2024-09-14,There‚Äôs way more potential for the technology than just‚Ä¶.. gaming.
2024-09-14,"Thats because you haven‚Äôt tried VR Porn in a good mix reality and 8k resolution.

AVP shall rule that niche, no more low quality porn, i want to be there!"
2024-09-14,"That's a personal preference,
Not everyone wants VR for games"
2024-09-14,"That‚Äôs kind of why AVP is not a VR headset, not meant for VR, and not advertised as one."
2024-09-14,"To be honest I got the quest 3 for gaming, but being middle aged and having kids I‚Äôm just too tired for gaming and standing up at the same time.
The AVP is made for people like me. Too tired to stand up."
2024-09-14,"Exactly, its ***one*** of them.

Other are f.e. buisness and productivity."
2024-09-14,"They‚Äôre not really comparable. The AVP uses eye tracking, and the software is in a different universe for quality than the Quest. It has a much wider range of apps, up around 2k now, many focused on productivity. 

The Quest is almost exclusively for gaming, and has a deep catalog of great VR and some MR content. The ui frankly sucks, and it often requires controllers, but probably good enough for what most people currently use a headset for currently."
2024-12-04,tbf..... why do you use a vr for daily activities when you can get any other device?
2025-02-14,Try more like x7 or even x10.5 on the 3s
2024-09-14,"Actually, its a little over 7x"
2024-09-14,"Unless you understand that it‚Äôs like any other device that runs apps and use it as one, so that‚Äôs a daily usage device."
2024-09-14,"No, play them in VR, silly!"
2024-09-14,"I was more referring to the panel.   And...  IDK I do see the optics improving that much over an LCD panel on the Q3 as a big-ish deal.   

I own... Q2,Qpro,Q3, AVP...  

I am maybe the only guy not laughing at Zuck when he said he flat out has the better headset in the Quest 3 at only $500.  If you factor in how dev-kit-y the Vision Pro is he's right.  Not a Meta hater at all.   

But, if we're just comparing screens/optical stack.   Apple wins, it's not super close. Meta's next high-end headset is set to release in 2026? 2027?  Longer?  And I've only heard rumors that I'm not sure I believe of Google Samsung maybe getting in the game maybe in a year?  Maybe."
2024-09-14,Was it the sarcasm?
2024-09-16,"In a couple of generations we will have to see, for now I don‚Äôt only care for a glass factor monitor, I like the fact that the AVP is an actual fully fledged device. I use it for many things personally.

I‚Äôd be definitely interested in a lighter device that can run apps, even if it‚Äôs tethered to another, so long as it has eye + hand tracking, touch capabilities, 4k resolution and an actual OS experience. Anything less I‚Äôd consider a downgrade personally.

Currently, the AVP is the only one achieving this level of quality, immersion and 3d are clearly not its primary use cases, but rather standard apps, which work quite well!"
2024-09-15,"Honestly, it's not that much better. Both the lower FOV and blurrier optics make using it for a monitor replacement not that much better. 

People have done in depth testing of this and shown that the overall clarity improvement isn't as much as you would think by just reading the paper specs. I found that to be pretty accurate after using the Vision Pro for about 8 hours. Color wise, especially when viewing movies, those MicroOLED panels are incredible. But the sharpness for screen viewing is limited by the optics. You're also still limited to only a single screen when paired with your mac. Virtual Desktop is a better implantation of screen usage.

2024-09-14,"its not much use that the blacks are better, because the lenses are much worse on the psvr."
2024-09-14,"Have you tried? I spent hours trying to get a simple spotify apk loaded in only for it to simply not work when opening app. Instant delete, no point losing one‚Äôs time. The fact that it is android it doesn‚Äôt mean that it is as accessible as your phone. Back in the day hackintosh where also popular, but I wouldn‚Äôt describe losing hours on hacking to get basic keyboard mapping ‚Äúthe same as‚Äù. Just like here, having to jump through hoops to install any app via third party stores and a pc connection to side load, can we agree it‚Äôs not the same as open the store, search and install?"
2024-09-14,I love this response and that u actually use the device!! I think with the prices dropping on eBay it can only be a good thing and that more people will be able to use it and buy them and develop for them!
2024-09-14,"It doesn‚Äôt work like that. There‚Äôs certain standards for HDR. Dolby Vision certification requires displays for content creators to have a peak luminance of at least 1,000 nits. AVP can only deliver up to 100 nits."
2024-09-14,Ofc... porn
2024-09-16,Yes once form factor/battery life/wireless mobile connectivity gets better.
2024-12-05,virtual sex and virtual girlfriends would be the ulimate
2024-12-19,Gaming is what pushes the limits in technology and processing speeds of computers. Soo in reality its quite often the games that push the technology forward.
2024-09-14,Apple wasn't allowing it to stream web content in VR at launch. Did that change?
2024-11-26,"This is less dependent on anything on the Vision Pro specifically, and more on the source material. You just need high resolution and nice optics. Most of the extra cost on the vision pro is about things that would have no bearing on VR porn."
2024-09-14,I literally only use mine for porn lol
2024-09-14,yeah some people get it exclusively for a deovr premium subscription amirite.
2024-09-14,Sure but you don't have to play games on the quest 3 you can run virtual desktop if you want. You can get big screen and stream content. What does the vision pro offer that you can't get for cheaper other than bizarre hardware stuff like face pass through
2024-09-14,[deleted]
2024-09-14,Does it have screens that block out all incoming light that go in front of your eyes? Its a VR headset. The difference between vr and ar is non existant when there isn't an actual transparent screen there.
2024-09-14,just... sit down and use the quest 3?
2024-09-14,"People aren't daily driving The vision pro as if it were a phone. It's a crazy idea that people would go out of their way to strap a brick on their face rather than pull their phone out to check whatever app they want to use. The reason VR games are worth playing is because they are tailored to what the device can offer. 

You can't play bone works with mouse and keyboard and get the same experience, what apps does the vision pro offer that wouldn't work fine on a phone"
2024-09-14,You can play steamVR games on AVP? I didn‚Äôt think that was possible. That changes my opinion of the AVP quite a bit
2024-09-15,"The panels are huge for the initial wow factor but, use cases really does matter more in the grand scheme. I used the Vision Pro for about 8 hours and the screens are amazing but, I was already going ""ok, now what do I do with this?"" after only 8 hours. Whereas with my other headsets, I can do all the same things and a lot more. I now have a backlog of content for my Q3/Pro. 

I think if Apple keeps improving it and adding content/use cases, it will be the king of the industry. But they have a ways to go."
2024-09-14,Sure... but even if we're just comparing the Quest store to the AVP store the Quest has a much much larger catalog. I think there are plenty of things that the AVP does better but the App Store feels like a ghost town in comparison. I'm curious as to what you're doing with an AVP that you can't do with a Quest. I've never tried Spotify but pretty much all of the apps that I've sideloaded just worked. There were a definitely a few that didn't play nice with the touch inputs though.
2024-09-14,"I do, it‚Äôs now my primary device. I game, watch movies and work on it via Mac virtual display. If anything it needs improvements, but the lack of things to do it‚Äôs non existent. It can seem that way if people buy it exclusively for VR and 3d/immersive stuff, then yes there‚Äôs very little, but I‚Äôm not sure why you would buy any device only for that, which is far from what you do daily with technology!"
2024-09-14,"Again, much less relevant in a pitch black OLED environment like the headset - your brain adjusts to whatever brightness so at least you get HDR with the right apps like Apple TV. The main drawback is the reflected glare from inside the lens.
Dolby Cinema spec is 108 HDR nits, BTW."
2025-02-13,"So this is the ""vr media consumption"" I keep hearing about in youtube videos."
2024-12-05,virtual sex
2024-12-24,And porn is what sets the standard everyone uses
2024-09-14,Yeah
2024-09-14,"To be fair I don‚Äôt have AVP or have tried mix reality porn yet. But I can see the appeal if done correctly.

Specially if they do volumetric video. I think we are a couple years away from it to become a ‚Äúnormality‚Äù"
2024-09-27,it's weird how different the girls look in vr.  They don't know how to shoot it either.
2024-09-14,"I mean, is that not true for everything?

What can't an expensive iphone do more than an average android phone,

It comes down to how it is done, Speed of the device and software and stuff"
2024-09-20,"You can use ALVR instead of VD. Games, like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Cat‚Äù, ‚ÄúExternal Space‚Äù will start being released after the launch of visionOS 2, it just takes a little time, and everything will be ready."
2024-11-02,"I thought the same question as you before I tried AVP. I had no interest in one, since their announcement, until an Apple employee, who did a retreat at Apple Park training on AVP, encouraged me to consider getting an AVP instead of upgrading my laptop or iPad, which is what I was playing around in the store over. He explained that Apple's approach to AVP was based on asking what's beyond the phone and the laptop approach to tech engagement with the world. He said Apple knows people don't want phones or laptops and that not far away‚Äîwe won't have them. He said people just want what they can do with them. So, Apple is trying to move beyond the phone and laptop to get to the heart of what people actually want from their relationship with tech. 

I did a 45 minute demo at Apple and there were a couple things that make it tempting to buy. You can turn any photo into a spatial photo and looking at those is a killer app (but still not ""starting at $3,499"" killer). But, looking at videos and Live Photos that were actually shot using Spatial Photos are incredible. And old photos, converted, almost as much. And I think old people will cry when they experience being able to be with their mom again.

The typical things look good...like movies or YouTube. But I think the fact that you can basically have a ""VR iPad"" or your ""VR Mac"" desktop 2D windows on the device is just another convenient feature in Apple's ecosystem. But these were just added little features to me.

What  I was surprised most by is the way the environments, volume, and eye-tracking works is also incredible. You can be anywhere and with just a half turn of the digital crown and just looking at the environmental rocker, you phase out passthrough and are on the beach in Bora Bora, alone, and the resolution's pixels can't be detected. You could be in a closet, a parking lot, or a messy studio apartment with roommates and it transports you to an open beach alone. It's incredible and was the first time in a long time that I felt creatively inspired thinking I could write my novel like this, dictating it, or using a hardware magic keyboard, which AVP can see even while in Bora Bora.

I'm not trying to sell it, but the killer apps are the way it transports you into different space and time‚Äîyour own memories and also to tranquil places that really calm you down and inspire. I loved the way time passed using it rather than using it to pass the time (or waste it like gaming for me.) 

Everyone on here is asking what can it do? Well, it really just gives you the space and peace to do whatever you want. AVP gets out of your way. It's more of a canvass with Apple's touch of aesthetics, which I've always thought is conducive to getting creative work done. And, I'd like one.

I have a Quest 3 and a Quest 2. They can be pretty cool and pretty fun, and I like engaging with others in Bigscreen (usually), but Quest is a toy (which is great). AVP is virtual reality for work and leisure and a great mixture of both since you can work on the beach. And Apple's eye-tracking is their next great user interface. To do the things Quest does well, I prefer the controllers and the pointing and clicking.

  
I think AVP is marketed all wrong. They shouldn't even show the device. They should just show talking heads of people saying what they were able to do with it.

AVP made me want to (and I have) started taking Spatial photos with my iPhone. You are going to want this. It's like entering a cutscene in a movie where there's a flashback looking at these‚Äîbut it's your life. It's going to change writing and filmmaking and blocking and the way directors see movies in their heads before they make them. The initial tries like  Apple's ""Submerged"" demonstrate some of the ways movies can be made, but the focus on what they CAN do also shows how badly many new films will be made to ""beat a dead horse,"" so to say, with the new types of shots that can be experienced. Not all drama needs to be or should be an audience-participating theme park ride. I like the voyeur aspect of watching drama. I don't want to be immersed all the time.

I also like the way you can set up windows in a room in your house for one part of a project and then set up entirely different sets in another room and then switch by walking to those different rooms! Instead of window switching on a Mac, you can physically move to another room in your house. I was surprised to see how active I wanted to be using it. I was getting up and walking around tables and squatting and standing and flailing grabbing space like an idiot and everyone was staring at me. Having to be physical with the Nintendo WII or the Meta Quest 2 kind of annoyed me and usually I figured out ways to just sit there and do minimal physical activity, but it's more fun and more natural to move with AVP. I thought."
2024-11-26,"If you haven't used one, explanations are probably meaningless. It's not that it will do more -- imo it does less because it's simply not made for immersive gaming -- it's just done so remarkably well. I tried one today and it's the nicest headset I've tried. I wouldn't buy it, mostly because I have no intention of entering into Apple's ecosystem, but what I'm curious about is how close you can get to it for a more VR focused experience and what that would cost without the Apple tax."
2024-09-14,"Yeah, I really don't think VR is going to be viable for most people looking to do anything beyond entertainment until we get MOST HMDs to the scale of something like the Bigscreen. 

You can have all the gimmicks you want, high resolution screens and pancake lenses and eye tracking and everything, but I really don't think most people are going to wanna stick a hot brick on their face for $500+ and more than 30 minutes unless that hot brick is small and light enough you forget it's there."
2024-09-14,"Sure, and the earth is not a sphere but a geoide, but people still call it a sphere cause from their point of view is round. For VR most people intend a device you use to see an immersive experience that does not include reality, mostly 3D and 360, game or not.

That definition is pretty much useless with a device that mostly runs 2D apps projecting in your face your real environment.
If we are splitting hair, everything is a computer.
If you want to go by the definition of ‚Äúeverything that has displays attached to your eyes and blocks out your view‚Äù, then so far the AVP is the best VR headset out there for its price, given the 4k OLED pancake lenses.

However, for all intense and purposes, it really isn‚Äôt, since you can‚Äôt run a single VR experience on it, which is mostly games at this point.

So yeah, it‚Äôs not meant for VR, although it shares most of the technical capabilities and hardware, just like a PS5, albeit having a CPU, a GPU, storage, RAM and an HDMI port, is not great as a productivity device, although it shares most of the hardware with a computer.

You can‚Äôt ignore the software component, it‚Äôs silly‚Ä¶"
2024-11-26,"You're wrong about the distinction with AR and VR though. AR is when computer generated imagery is integrated into real imagery around you that you interact with in ""real time."" Those camera apps that put things in the real world is a form of augmented reality. Having passthrough cameras (particularly as good as in the AVP) and integrating imagery into that is augmented reality. A clear screen that you look through, that you're talking about, is also augmented reality.

Regarding VR and AVP, it's not made for any kind of immersive VR. It can only be used for stationary VR. The AR focus of it with the lack of immersive VR is why it's not really called a VR headset."
2024-09-14,"And I do, but the quest works best in room scale with controllers. 
Where the avp is be made for sitting down and using your hands for interaction.
The quest hand tracking just isn‚Äôt good enough"
2024-09-14,"Why is it a crazy idea? I use it as an ipad, do you keep a tablet in your pocket? It‚Äôs not going out of your way at all, it‚Äôs simply a preference over another device. If I need to answer a message or a phone call, I‚Äôm not going to hold on and put the headset on, but if I want to perform a task that is an hour or so long, or even 30 mins, given the possibility, I use the AVP, as it‚Äôs just more convenient than staring at the small screen on my phone. I‚Äôm using reddit while I browse now, been doing research on stuff for the past hour or so, and I‚Äôm on the AVP right now. It‚Äôs not crazy at all, it‚Äôs a 4k oled screen with windows you can resize how much you want and put where you want.

You can not like it of course, you don‚Äôt need to, but it‚Äôs not crazy, just like it isn‚Äôt using a laptop or a tablet. A phone is a pocket device, but you‚Äôd be most probably lying if you were to tell me you haven‚Äôt had sessions of 30 mins on your phone, scrolling here or on socials or watching youtube.

I‚Äôd add that you are in a virtual reality sub, not sure defining HMDs a brick in your face is actually the right statement for this sub üòÇ

To your point ‚Äúwhat app does AVP offer that wouldn‚Äôt work on a phone‚Äù, the point is not where they work or where they don‚Äôt. Not sure you have noticed, but most services are available on almost all devices. The point of technology is to meet customers where they are. You use a phone today almost like you use a laptop. Most apps you use daily, maybe a part from the actual phone and gps, work just as well on a laptop, you still get a phone for its agility of use being a pocket device. Why do you buy tablets if phones are just as good? What do we need foldable phones for?

This all goes down to real estate. We consume more and more content with technology, so customers are starting to simply want better ways to consume it. It‚Äôs not for everybody, but I‚Äôm one of the people that would rather see a 4k youtube video on m AVP OLED displays than on my phone, in fact I almost don‚Äôt use my phone for videos anymore, cause believe it or not, putting the headset on is a no brainer‚Ä¶"
2024-09-14,"Yes, but it's still very new and requires external controllers for a lot of games [https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1bmn6gd/getting\_started\_with\_alvr\_on\_vision\_pro/](https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1bmn6gd/getting_started_with_alvr_on_vision_pro/)"
2024-09-15,"They do have a ways to go it feels soooo unfinished software-wise and not working with any controllers feels unfinished hardware-wise as well. 

And I wouldn‚Äôt recommend anybody buy this and try to set up ALVR and play Steam games with this thing at present.  You‚Äôd also need knuckles/basestations and a ton of patience dealing with settings in some non-perfect software. 

That said, you get it working and‚Ä¶.  You see it‚Äôs all possible (and there‚Äôs a second wow factor). The headsets OS/software is nerfed but the device itself is capable of getting into that Steam catalog which opens everything up. I feel like there comes a day in the next couple years where the barrier to entry for getting there is lowered."
2024-09-14,"I don‚Äôt know, I use 20+ apps in AVP, same as I use in my iPhone and iPad, and a part from banking, I found pretty much everything I would use daily, none of which are available on the Quest Store. If you are talking about games, of course the Quest Store has 500+ games in the catalog, but I filter for apps, and useful every day ones, the Quest has almost nothing‚Ä¶ Are you thinking of Vision Pro only apps, or are you counting iPad compatible apps too? Currently I‚Äôm writing from AVP‚Äôs native Reddit app, it‚Äôs the iPad compatible one, but still works great for its purpose."
2024-09-14,"Here‚Äôs a list of things I do daily which I didn‚Äôt like doing on the quest and love doing on AVP:
- browsing, using my history and password management from google or icloud
- PS5 streaming to get a big monitor via MirrorPlay
- Reddit, X, FaceTime, Messages, Whatsapp (which is actually better on the Quest, but I included it cause I use it here too)
- YouTube via Juno (in 4k), Apple TV, Disney+, Netflix 4k via Supercut, Chunchyroll HD (I don‚Äôt care for paying for 4k for animes, not yet)
- Books via Apple Books, O‚ÄôReilly books for development, Manga via Shonen Jump
- ChatGPT
- Trading 212 and Finance to manage stocks
- Slack and Zoom for working
- using Mac virtual display to work (just works seamlessly)
- Mail, Calendar, Passwords, syncing on all my accounts (personal / work, couldn‚Äôt use it without them for productivity)
- Okta verify as a 2FA for work
- Apple Music (used to use Spotify via another app, but sound quality was just better on Music)
- SheetMusic, a music app I use for sheets, available on iPad and iPhone (I take piano lessons this way with the AVP and it‚Äôs incredibly useful via FaceTime as I can show my teacher exactly what I see, including my fingers pointing at notes on the app)

One of the biggest one I use too, which I didn‚Äôt add in the above list cause the Quest is also just as good at that, is Moonlight Vision for pc gaming streaming. It‚Äôs amazing, and although the Quest is better at that via Virtual Desktop (even though I don‚Äôt always want to be in the cinema environment, and the passthrough mode is not great on Quest), once I got used to AVP, given all the things I do with it, as mentioned above, it does not make sense for me to go back and forth, so I use Moonlight, which benefits from 4k OLED graphics the Quest 3 does not have.

So as you can see, there‚Äôs plenty of stuff I‚Äôd say?"
2024-09-15,"Without looking at specs just going by my favourite devices, I seem to always go for the Vision Pro despite having recent oled tv, mini led tv, projector (sold, this becomes not good enough).

Brightness has never occurred to me to be an issue when using AVP. This is with owning a 1800nit mini led tv and 1000nit oled."
2024-09-27,I just use regular porn sites on it  I don‚Äôt need the 3d stuff lol. Just make the screen large is enough for me
2024-11-26,"Yea, it's weird how some shots are perfection, and then then next thing you know you're cross eyed because there's a gaping asshole negative three inches from your face.

What gets me is how some porn stars become considerably more attractive in 3d than they are flat."
2024-09-14,"It seems like you made a good argument as to why apple shouldn't overprice the shit out of all their technology. I think apple is good at innovating and improvising existing technology but honestly, what does the vision pro do that isn't already on the market? And even if there are a few good things about it how does its limited functionality justify being nearly 10x the price of cheaper consumer headsets?

Sure, when it's a phone people might spend the extra money to have some added speed, visual fidelity, and picture quality. But even that Is only like a couple hundred more at most, not several multipliers more expensive."
2024-11-09,This. My wife started crying watching a spatial video of our baby and young kids. Now I need to get one of those handheld things to keep my phone steady
2024-11-26,"The eye tracking didn't work that well for me. Looking down at things presented problems forcing me to tilt my head down and look up with my eyes at times. Not sure if it's my eyes, or some more calibration was needed. From my experience with that part, at least, it has a lot of work.

It's otherwise a phenomenal AR experience though. Making a GIANT screen for something is cool, and the windows do a great job of existing in space. Having a screen at your desk, one over by the chair and so on is great. The gestures work very well for controlling things. Far more natural for controllers for these purposes.

It's great at stationary VR stuff. The video demos are really fantastic (I'll throw money at the NFL to watch the next super bowl entirely in VR), but that's not particularly special about this device. That's just dependent on the screen and optics.

It's not really made for immersive VR gaming at all, and it wasn't designed for that, so that's not a surprise. It lacks basic features needed like a spatial grid, and controllers here become necessary.

I wouldn't buy one, but I can definitely understand why people would if they don't use it for gaming."
2024-12-24,So it's for rich people and professionals. Nice
2024-09-14,"It's just a marketing ploy to distance itself from video games which are icky and unprofessional. AVP is no doubt the best vr headset but not ""for the price"" more like despite the price. It's one of the most expensive vr headsets out there. Is it a good piece of hardware yes, is the software good, yes, is it a vr headset yes, is it a good value no. You definitly can play games on it. I have. ""you can't run a single vr experience on it"" is completely false. The only thing different between q3 passthrough and AVP ""AR"" is the quality of the screens and mostly the quality of the outward facing cameras."
2024-09-14,"Is it the hand tracking that is worse or simply is missing the eye tracking?

I only have the quest 3, and i feel the hand tracking is ok to control the interface (it is not good enough to play games though, a bit slow)

BUT without the eye tracking to know where tou want to press, is much more limited."
2024-09-15,Well said. Can‚Äôt believe people don‚Äôt get this
2024-09-16,"Walking around a shopping mall think whipping a phone out of ones pocket is a bit easier then strappping an avp to ones head.  Main use cases for AVP would be at home or travelling, or if you have some time to sit somewhere.  Out and about strolling around, a phone is way more convenient."
2024-11-12,So you are saying youre using AVP because Iphone is small if i get you right? Then wouldnt it be easier to use just computer with a big screen or projector to watch videos and stuff?
2025-02-14,This is why I think a smart watch and basic looking smart glasses are the way to go (more viable for those who need a prescription) over a bulky headset to accept calls with. Screen you're calls on wrist and swipe you're glasses lol or tell it to accept call. I prefer discreet
2024-09-14,Have you tried the UEVR mod? Does that work?
2024-09-15,"Oh yeah, I could definitely see the potential. It very well could be the clear king of the industry if they keep adding. And I can say, hands down, I want MicroOLED at that resolution in my next headset. Those screens are lovely. FAR better than the PenTile OLED in my Vive Pro and PSVR2. 

I believe Apple will keep adding. It's just going to take time."
2024-09-14,"Here‚Äôs another detail which does get enough praises: eye tracking and hand tracking.
While Quest 3 has much faster hand tracking (for gaming this makes total sense and it‚Äôs needed), AVP eye + hand tracking combo is way more precise.

Using a device for productivity means using a laptop or pc keyboard and mouse most of the time, so if you also have to pick up controllers to use the HMD OS cause hand tracking gets in the way (Quest pinching gesture on its UI is legit unusable, the cursor keeps moving when you pinch), is just not fast enough.

As an added bonus, I can fully control AVP with the laptop mouse and keyboard when they are connected via Virtual Desktop."
2024-11-02,"Yeah after trying AVP, I like it a lot, but I didn't understand why it couldn't just be a $1,000 headset that plugs into the heavy USB-C iPhone (I already have in my pocket) for power and processing."
2025-01-03,"Today it is. In the future, it made me think of movie Ready Player 1 because of how transportive it is. I think this device, when it's cheaper in the future, will have more value to folks who live on top of 7 people in an apartment or trailer park in an urban environment than rich people in the country. Because it can put you on a beach or anywhere by yourself for no added cost."
2024-09-14,"I will have to strongly disagree, but it matters little honestly. I think by your definition, you are somewhat right, but you see, you might think that it‚Äôs not worth the price cause as a VR headset, it doesn‚Äôt deliver more than other do, but my point exactly is that that comparison is wrong. try to compare it to an ipad, and although there is a price difference of course, the use case is similar, but you get way more solely thanks to the screens and the flexibility.

For me, sure it‚Äôs pricey, but I get wayyy more value from this, as I use it 8 hours a day, than I do from my iPad and Quest 3 (which I haven‚Äôt used in almost 2 months now).
It‚Äôs definitely nit 3500¬£ value, I agree, but it‚Äôs more than good value, it does not sit in  a shelf doing nothing cause I use it for everything I mentioned above, and it delivers brilliantly.
I think we need to wait for a Samsung competitor to compare, than when those devices will also not focus on traditional VR use cases, distancing from VR as a term to describe headsets will make sense, cause by definition these types of headsets are actually XR, and I can agree on that terminology rather than spatial (although yes it doesn‚Äôt deliver cause not many people know what VR/MR/AR/XR stand for, but everybody knows what computing means)."
2024-09-16,"Yes, you can game on it by setting up AVLR, having light house tracking, and streaming from you gaming PC.  But it is not included out of the box or the pattern of a typical apple user, or what apples target market is (i.e. media. business, and productivity.)"
2024-09-14,"With vision in pro it‚Äôs seamless. I‚Äôll admit the quest 3 is like 60% of the way there in terms of hand tracking, and interacting with the windows and all of that but it‚Äôs like Apple just polished it all down to a T. It definitely feels like an android vs iPhone comparison, now is that worth the money difference? That‚Äôs up to to decide. I‚Äôd definitely get rid of the Vision Pro to save money if there were another headset that was as seamless as this, but quest 3 is right behind the Vision Pro definitely. I might honestly just sell the Vision Pro and yes it would be a downgrade but I need the money more!!"
2024-09-15,"I think VR has made headsets a gaming artefact, so for some people, this is what strapping a brick to your face is there for. There‚Äôs a push to find the killer app, the thing you can‚Äôt do without that device, when in fact most of the reason why we all went nuts for smartphones was that we wanted more of technology and everywhere we were. It was always about convenience. Otherwise phones would have just been cameras, messages and calls.

Now you have mobile as a concept, we keep adding different types of devices for screen and portability, and this is just yet another iteration of it, nothing more, nothing less.

The funny thing is that anybody that tried it complained about price and comfort, but not once about its usage or what things you can‚Äôt do on it. The ones that try it at the store via the demo, or read from other experiences online, then do complain about lack of 3d content, cause they think that‚Äôs the main feature. It will take a minute to try it on, open your regular apps, and see that the value is simply in the flexibility of using windows of any size and position you want, as well as the interoperability with other devices thanks to an OS that does that already, nothing new."
2024-09-16,"Oh 100% a home device, no reason to use it outside. The battery would also die on you after 2 hours. Bit then again, you don‚Äôt just (hopefully) stare at an app the whole time when you walk around a shopping mall, which is why using AVP in that context would bring little to no advantage. It‚Äôs mostly a focus device.

Phones are way better at being pocket devices you use quickly and put back away, this isn‚Äôt changing. But if you think how many hours people might still waste on them consuming videos, tiktok, messages, it‚Äôs not hard to see that for lingerie sessions, a smart glasses devices or headset is definitely better, especially on your eyes!"
2024-11-12,"Nope, nowhere near the same flexibility. One thing doesn‚Äôt exclude the other, but screen and projectors are still limited and not as flexible. Projectors require quite a large space and a dark room, which rules out being in the same room as someone else doing anything else, plus they would only exist where you set them up and are nowhere near the same visual quality (OLED being one of the main thing here).

Screens can be good, but small, also you‚Äôd be tight to windows in the same space ahead of you, so it‚Äôs not using as much of the space around. This is fine for highly focuses tasks, bur since I‚Äôve been working with AVP, it‚Äôs been great to have calendar and mails or music quickly accessible just by glancing at my left or right, rather than having to switch desktop.

Overall it‚Äôs just more flexibility, immersion and portability (I can get better quality than what a projector offers wherever I am, not just in a very big room with specific setup). Even for smaller apps, iphone like, it‚Äôs still more flexible and honestly if it wasn‚Äôt for battery and comfort, I‚Äôd almost only use my phone when I‚Äôm out now."
2024-09-15,Yes
2024-11-22,"Your phone can't do it. The Vision Pro has a 39whr battery and it consumes the whole thing in 2-3 hours. Your phone by comparison has a 15whr battery. It is not possible for a phone to power a VR headset with that fidelity at high refresh rates, while simultaneously processing all of the sensor information for pass-through. It is absurd."
2024-09-15,">It definitely feels like an android vs iPhone comparison, now is that worth the money difference?

No of course not, the Samsung flagship is better."
2024-11-13,"Its not much flexibility if the battery dies after 2 hours of use? Try watching LOTR trilogy iex. nope, cant. 

Why would you need more than lets say 10 spaces open? You can achieve that with 55"" monitor easily. No need to even turn your head, just move eyes. 

I dont buy it there can be noise and other people around with AVP either, the noise for sure comes through and thats a bad distraction."
2024-11-08,"Theres a good take that i agree with in here somewhere about the value of good onboarding ux in MR products, but it got a little circlejerky in the second half"
2024-11-08,Woa someone took too many mushrooms.
2024-11-08,"Literally just bought the Meta Quest 3 today, used, with a bunch of third-party accessories for $400. The Bobo VR strap is amazing, and I was pretty impressed with the hand tracking and pass-through. I did, however, spend an hour plus going through settings to enable experimental features and download apps.

I completely agree with the first-time experience and the level of attention Apple gives to this. If only Apple had the option for connecting third-party VR controllers and allowing Steam games, it would be perfect. 

My favorite feature about the Quest is not only the games but the social interactions that can be possible. I‚Äôm 30 years old, but I‚Äôve actually met very interesting people and Meta Horizon worlds on the Quest two (as well as plenty of annoying kids), but that hasn‚Äôt happened once on the Vision Pro because I have no way to meet strangers. I was able to use spatial personas with people from Reddit, but that lasted no longer than a week."
2024-11-08,"Yes, the Meta Quest 3 is sold below actual manufacturing price with the expectation that they'll make it up in software sales combined with establishing a foothold on the market. The Apple Vision Pro is sold with a profit margin (not including initial R&D) which is part of its competitive disadvantage. And I'm okay with that.

Beyond the total superiority of the Apple displays, the privacy issue is why I'll never be going with the Quest line."

2024-11-08,storage costs nothing bro
2024-11-08,TL;DR pls
2024-11-09,"I have both and won't be selling either. They do different things. The quest 3 is mostly just a VR game console. The UI is objectively bad, but I only use it to get to the games. The quest 3 does one thing better, there is much less glare from the lenses."
2024-11-09,I figured this post was just going to be another dry review of the two. But this turned out to be gold. Thanks for posting it!
2024-11-10,"The engineers from Meta are incredibly good. They are doing a great job‚Ä¶ but, but‚Ä¶ They can‚Äôt solve everything only with software. Basically, AVP has way more sensors, cameras, mics‚Ä¶ so everything is just right. Quest 3 has ‚Äúeverything‚Äù but it crashes, flashes‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt do exactly what it should do because Meta tries its best via software."
2024-11-27,"The BOM cost of AVP is said to be around $1500. At $3500 retail, I do not believe Apple is losing any money on the device. That's the main problem with it though. Its way too costly to gain any kind of meaningful adoption.

Meta chose a different route. They are heavily subsidizing the hardware in exchange for market share and software sales. The move appears to be paying off.

For Meta, as of march 2023, there were said to be 20 million units sold. Likely much more than that now that the $299 MQ3s is available. According to Google, Apple has sold¬†fewer than 300,000¬†Vision Pro units so far, and is not expected to sell 500,000 in 2024"
2024-11-08,"It is very unlikely that Apple would be selling AVP at a per-unit loss on manufacturing and marketing costs.  This just isn't how Apple does business and it generally is not a good strategy for brand new expensive technology.  It's a good way to get market share but it acquires customers who are only there because they're getting the better end of the deal.  That's what Meta has done, and they've created a nice cash-losing business unit so far which I'm sure Apple does not envy.  

I think Apple is content to grow the market size at whatever pace the device's value proposition allows at a price that exceeds its cost to build plus a profit margin.  If it turns out that the value to consumers is too far under the build cost they'll give up eventually."
2024-11-08,"Meta has been building the plane while it is in the air so it comes with all that history but also the clunkiness. Apple really focused on polish and it shows, I just think sometimes they overtry on trying to be a perfect seamless UI so when it fails its jarring and it isnt flexible for folk to do more outside of the guardrails.  Apple would be wise to open it up a lil to the possible detriment of users creating issues and it not looking great. Both can learn from each other. koombayyah kinda deal :)"
2024-11-29,üòÇ
2024-11-08,why I made such a long post
2024-11-29,"This tracks, actually, with Apple's avg. 35% gross margin seemingly unbreakable ""rule"" about everything they've ever produced since TRoS (The Return of Steve) in 1996. üëç"
2024-11-08,"I disagree with you on this; the Vision Pro even with its $3500 price tag doesn‚Äôt cover the R&D costs in the slightest. It sure covers the manufacturing cost, but Apple has been working on the Vision Pro for almost a decade, the amount of people buying it certainly doesn‚Äôt cover the R&D cost."
2024-11-08,Yep exactly
2024-11-08,"Yeah, those oled panels alone are like 1400$ of the price, and I'm not sure if that's Apple's discount volume price. People forget how expensive bright and dense oled panels at that size are. There's a reason HTC/Meta/Pico/Sony aren't jumping on board going 4K per eye oled and instead doing 2kx2k LCD panels still. Go check panel outlook and go find a seller for some of those panels or ones like them and get you a rough estimate. It's insane. That's just the panel, then you figure in the board, controller, optics, and everything else. I mean assume that everything else was free in the headset it's still expensive.

I have no idea how expensive that external lenticular screen is that the eyes are shown through, in the scheme of things, sure it might knock off 100$ or so of the price, but it isn't much, i doubt switching over to plastic vs metal would either.

The whole build is just top of the line hardware.

You're buying a top of the line headset, go compare it to anything Varjo makes, and it's on par or above with their latest headsets.  Except even theirs don't have motion to photon latency and resolution and brightness and what not as AVP, and theirs cost like 2-3x as much, and are still a wired experience requiring a crazy powerful PC."
2024-11-08,"I literally said ""per-unit loss on manufacturing and marketing costs"".  I did not include R&D, it's not part of the per-unit net calculation because it's *not per-unit*.  Initial R&D is recovered over time with per-unit operating profits.  I don't know what recovery time period Apple targets but I do suspect it is much shorter than Meta's 10-20 years from the point when started selling their first product.

At some point ongoing annual R&D will be limited to what can be funded by product profits but I would not expect that to be the case right now or for the next few years."
2024-11-29,"Assume the panels are Sony? TCL made one like this several years ago, which Panavision used for the Millennium DXL 1/2 EVF (a \*marvel\*, if you ever have the opportunity to look through one, easily $10-12K inclusive of the optical block), but these have a 'flavor' that, to me, give a Sony fingerprint ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
2024-02-15,"As one reviewer put ‚ÄúMagic, until it‚Äôs not‚Äù."
2024-02-15,"The funny thing is that its not even about which device is better. Its totally dependent upon your usecase

And so many reviews come to the conclusion that while AVP is a magnificent device, you can‚Äôt really do anything with it.

And I assume that Meta would be able to build a device for 3500$ that could compete with apples VP.

But Zuck isn‚Äôt going that route. At least not at the moment. He wants to build the market first. As VR is a niche. And lets be honest, what are the odds that people actually replace their common devices with VR headsets? 

For me it‚Äôs something additional, something I can only experience inside a VR headset.
I have absolutely no interest in replacing my TV with it which my entire family can use together at the same time. Or replace my work setup which is highly effective as it is right now.

But all I see the Vision pro being used for is doing things in the headset you could already do in real life. And the fuck, I don‚Äôt need a bazillion screens‚Ä¶ thats not a feature at all. Focus on one thing, seriously even our stupid phones alone are already distracting enough"
2024-02-15,"Vision pro has nothing- no games, no social- nothing.  It costs as much as a car and anyone who has owned Apple products know if something happens to it- you can go pound sand before you get support from Apple."
2024-02-15,"The comparison is ridiculous when the result doesn't fit your view. For us, it is not, since we recommend these techs to businesses.

Nobody says Q3 is better in ALL aspects. It beats AVP in many areas, not to mention the price tag. So, yes, better value (or waaaay better value).

AVP is not VR (or not yet). 

If you want to spend 3500$ and just have an iOS with MacOS integration (aka productivity, though rendering from OS to Quest is also possible, but details) and watch movies, buy AVP (together with a headache)."
2024-02-15,"It‚Äôs very easy to compare them. They‚Äôre both VR headsets with mixed reality passthrough.

They both have strengths and weaknesses. 

I think where you land on either one being better or worse will depend on what you want one for. If you want to watch movies, the Vision Pro is better. If you want to play games, the Quest 3 is better. If you want to work, the Vision Pro is better. If you want to workout, the Quest 3 is better. 

I think what‚Äôs most disappointing about the Vision Pro, is that it isn‚Äôt better at *everything*. It really should be for 7 x the price. 

And I don‚Äôt think anyone really disagrees that micro OLED is going to be the next display tech for VR, it‚Äôs just very expensive. There‚Äôs also a number of reviewers talking about image persistence/blur/ghosting on the Vision Pro, so maybe microOLED isn‚Äôt 100% there for a more active/gaming device yet."
2024-03-07,Some of the points that you stated are silly and nonsensical.
2024-02-15,"Re ""software"" - while the AVP UI is great, isn't the key point that there is very little to do except watching 3D movies that wouldn't be easier and better done on a nice large screen?"
2024-02-15,"4th the price? More like 7th the price :)


But yes, VP is definitely better in most specs and for its use cases. That's the Apple magic.


Quest 3 price to quality value is insane though. I honestly love this hmd to bits. My favourie so far."
2024-02-15,"3.5 thousand dollars, plus the cost to buy and or subscribe to a service with the movie you want to watch

Or 13 dollars on a cinema ticket"
2024-02-15,"Both devices have strengths and weaknesses. AVP is great for media consumption and work. Q3 can do those too but worse. 

AVP has more 2D apps, Q3 is way better for playing games. 

I don't get why people pretend that there is no reason to buy AVP.  Sure it's expensive but it can do some things better than Q3 that migh be worth a lot to some people."
2024-04-25,"So I just purchased the AVP with 1 TB SSD. Sadly I will be returning it. Why? First off let me say, the AVP is an amazing product. At the Apple Store I asked about how I could incorporate it into my music studio. I was about to purchase a MacBook Pro with M3 Max 16 core processor, 2 TB SSD and 48 GB memory. Yeah that's overkill, I know. 

Anyway, someone mentioned the Vision Pro and after talking to the Apple sales guy, he said he thought it would integrate well with Logic Pro, Cubase, etc. He wasn't sure and their guy who really used Logic and other DAW's was off. I told him if it didn't it would be returned or, if it wasn't perfect, I would be returning the AVP. He said, ""I can't blame you there.""

So, here is my take. First off, it doesn't integrate with my DAW's. It likely will someday but currently, nope. That is why it is going back and I'll be buying the MBP 14"". The tracking/finger tapping on the AVP is superb. It's kind of freaky how well it works. It's also bizarre watching a movie on a huge screen, getting up to go get a drink while still wearing the AVP and looking over at my couch and seeing a huge display, locked in space over my couch. Cool but freaky. The displays are amazing. The gripes I have are, a weird halo around the edges of the displays that I would imagine is a slight reflection of the display pixels themselves. there are a few more. Apple chose to use the basic M2 chip, not the Pro or Max. Let's face it, this thing isn't cheap, why use the bottom tier chip?

I ask why they used the M2 because when you increase the screen size, a few things happen (in 3D movies anyway). When looking at the screen you  notice that everything ""off axis"" is a bit out of focus. As you move your  eyes to look elsewhere that ""cone of focus"" follows your eyes, but not quickly enough. It's fast and barely noticeable but it is still there. They need to widen that field a bit so that you don't notice and increase the response time. It doesn't kill the experience but for $4k, sorry, it shouldn't do that. Then there is a slight smearing effect, kind of like watching a football game on a 60hz refresh big screen TV. I understand that the AVP is processing two displays at over 4K each but at that price point I believe the better processor would be more adept at handling the task. Let's face it, the, ""fun"" is gong BIG in 3D. If you make the screen considerably smaller, it isn't an issue.

The other oversight, to me anyway, is there is no USB-C port for an external SSD (think Real Estate agents recording walk-throughs of his/her listings as the AVP records 3D video really well). The other is Apple not making a repeater Vision Pro. If the Master had a plug that you could connect to another slave headset that only had the micro OLED displays but nothing else, it would be a game changer. Then you, your spouse/GF, kids, etc., could watch the same program material together. Who is going to pay $4k +, for a headset for each family member? Even if they did, they won't be watching the same thing, in sync, at the same time. The repeater should be a lot less and lighter. Only one person needs to control it. (think your TV remote).

While it won't work in my studio, at least not yet, I can't justify $4k for a single use, stereoscopic TV/monitor. There are some great business uses for it (again a real estate agent, etc.) but for me, it would be a crazy ""luxury item"" to keep it. That being said, I will seriously miss it. This past weeks TV and surfing experience has been cool AF!

In closing, I see this device getting better and better. They have already added a ton of apps/features/games since most of these comments have posted. Some day I'm sure it will integrate into my music studio but by the time it does, what generation will the AVP be and how much better? I'll wait until that day.

p.s. Sorry this post was so long!"
2024-02-15,"AVP isn't even a product.

It's an half baked prototype that doesn't offer anything else than things that already exist!"
2024-05-01,"I have both and honestly am disappointed with the Vision Pro. If the Quest 3 had the resolution of the Vision Pro, it would hands down be the winner. I think this whole idea that the Vision Pro is not for gaming is such a shame. $3,500 and it cant double as a gaming AND productivity device?"
2024-05-04,"Quest price isn't 1/4 of Vision pro's. It,s 1/7!"
2024-02-20,Quest 3 is a 7th of the avp price. I think the comparison is dumb as the market for a 3500 headset isn't that big.
2024-02-15,"that was The Verge, right?"
2024-02-16,"You got me curious about what kind of device they could make to sell at the same price. Quest Pro not only has eye but face tracking and pancake lenses, but given the depth sensor and much better resolution for regular and passthrough views, I'd think that would be possible at twice the price, but only if they worked on fundamental user interface. It has the advantage of a more matured XR ecosystem and software, so it would be interesting how a higher priced hardware could advance that. Similarly, I wonder how much Apple could pack into a $1500 headset."
2024-06-21,"This was my contention as well.  And that‚Äôs coming from someone who has an iPad, iPhone, MacBook Air, etc."
2024-02-15,"its literally getting SteamVR drivers and 3rd party controller support soon. So soon it will be able to play every PCVR title in Steams library.  

[https://www.roadtovr.com/steamvr-vision-pro-controller-support-ivry/](https://www.roadtovr.com/steamvr-vision-pro-controller-support-ivry/)"
2024-02-15,You genuinely think it has nothing? So I guess ive been staring at a black void for the past 2 weeks using it daily
2024-02-16,quest 2 price to quality is even better though
2024-02-15,You realize people spend upwards of 5k+ to build home theaters right?
2024-02-26,"You summed up why I returned the quest 3. I only want one for media consumption, and it just doesn‚Äôt do it well well enough. It‚Äôs a gaming device first."
2024-06-14,Cool beans.
2024-04-25,"I'm thinking you haven't tried the AVP? The user interface and displays are incredible. I will be returning mine because as of now, it doesn't seamlessly integrate with my music studio. Half baked? Um, no. Too expensive, absolutely. I will def miss it."
2024-02-15,It‚Äôs the highest fidelity VR I‚Äôve experience with a clean intuitive UI. Half baked prototype is just false
2024-02-15,"Yea that‚Äôs right. I completely agree with it.
I can‚Äôt see much use for the VP after the magic has worn off."
2024-02-16,"Sadly the display technology is not comparable at all. Apple has a hard time getting those screens manufactured and I think can only use about 20% of them after QC.

So for a more mass market oriented product that Meta sells the prices wont be dropping too much as there are literally not enough factories able to produce them"
2024-02-15,"Oh yeh? With controllers? Or do I also need to spend more on base stations and index controllers? 


Does apple support gaming? Will you have to compile these apps once a week or pay 99 a year for it? 

an oculus go works in steamvr, does that mean it‚Äôs a good experience? Does that mean it‚Äôs worth paying 3500 for a go?"
2024-02-15,"Sure, as long as Apple does not ban it. 

They don't like you accessing content purchased on other platforms. Don't be surprised when the app gets taken off the store."
2024-02-15,Anyone game on a mac even now?  There is no attention to gaming at all by apple
2024-02-15,"The better point imo would be what does it have that you can't already get from a Mac book or an iPhone that you slapped a 3ds screen onto?

Yeah, stereoscopic photos and videos are the future and all, but is that really worth 3500 dollars?"
2024-02-15,"do you think I think that's more justified either? Again, when 13 dollars gets you the same experience, spending 300+ times that is absurd

if you really want something in a similar ballpark to going to the movies, And you really want to pick your movie... Just get a quest 3?

For that use case, you're sacrificing a little bit of quality in exchange for *3000 dollars*. Most down to earth people would tell you that that's a reasonable trade off, especially because if you want to do something else once you're done with the movie you have significantly more options"
2024-02-15,"Great fidelity is nice but to do what exactly?

You don't even have the hour displayed on this thing!The Store navigation is awful (no search bar).   
You have close to 0 interesting VR or AR apps

To put so much energy and tech on a Disney films viewing device is such a waste of everything!

For example, the ONLY reason why I bought the Quest 3 is playing table tennis instantly with anyone in my living room (I discovered that watching Netflix with it or Youtube is great too). But I would NEVER buy a whole new device just to watch videos!"
2024-02-15,"same problem as for all VR headsets: what is creating the habit to use VR daily. For all people I know where the headset isn't collecting dust it's at least one game they obsess over; Population One, Onward, Beat Saber, the likes (all of which Meta made sure they acquired...)"
2024-02-15,3rd party controller support. It might be worth it. To assume PCVR games will never be a good experience on the VP is short sighted. Comparing it to an Oculus go is just childish. Seriously grow up lmao.
2024-02-15,You can use ps5 and Xbox controllers with iOS devices if that‚Äôs what you mean
2024-02-15,That's not entirely  true. They have their own ecosystem and Apple Arcade but if you are specifically taking about AAA games you can play the newest Capcom Resident Evil on M1 IPad Pros and Macs starting last year. It's completely short sighted to think Apple will stiffle gam8ng on the VP. They didn't focus on gaming at all but if that's what people end up wanting to use their VPs for its going to happen. Apple will eventually release their own VR experiences as well if it's what the users want. The VP is a VR headset no matter how they try and sell it to think it won't be able to play the basic PCVR slop that is out right now is silly.
2024-02-15,My current biggest use case is movies (especially 3D ones). It‚Äôs the first time a headset has matched the theater experience for me and that‚Äôs enough to justify it for now.
2024-02-15,"It‚Äôs totally personal preference, I‚Äôm completely satisfied paying more for the experience Vision Pro offers when it comes to watching content, other people might be totally fine with the Quest 3 which makes sense. Ease of use is also a big factor for me, the native TV app has any movie I would ever want to watch plus 3D support. Again if you want to do gaming though absolutely don‚Äôt buy the Vision Pro"
2024-02-26,$13 plus you‚Äôre around other people‚Ä¶yuk. You want to avoid that not see it as advantages to the Vision Pro.
2024-02-15,"11 table tennis on the Quest 3 is straight up the reason I got a Q3. I found it a way better way to play table tennis by myself and actually got better at real table tennis. Then discovered bit by bit more uses and I think is one of the best tech purchases I've made last year. Still, Pc is way better for everyday use because typing in Q3 doesn't feel that good."
2024-04-25,"By ""hour"" being displayed, are you referring to the time? You can just say, ""Hey Siri, what's the time?"" and it pops up. I had no problem navigating the store. That being said I heard it was kind of bad. I bought mine, April 21st. Sadly, It will be going back. Scroll to the end of this page for the reason why if you're interested."
2024-02-15,"Not really , my first time in VR was a PSVR1 back in 2018 and loved it.
Got the quest 2 in 20021 and Quest 3 recently and use it daily for gaming as well as PSVR2.
I was absolutely wowed by VR that it changed gaming for me completely.
My absolute main thing with VR is that I‚Äôm having fun.
And I‚Äôve had a blast with every headset I own and literally have more than enough games to see me through the year.
I suppose it just depends on the person really.
I find it silly that the VP and Q3 or always compared as different uses for different headseats.
If I‚Äôm into productivity then I would be interested in a VP down the line as it does look good at doing that.
But I‚Äôm just purely interested in having fun and gaming at the moment."
2024-02-21,"Anyone who ever thinks anything apple can game is beyond delusional. We're in 2024 and still apple computers can barely play a fraction of what's on PC. Gaming has never been apples strong suit and never will be. Also the idea of having to buy a top end PC AND a 3500 device to play games is insane.

Meta or Valve index win gaming hands down."
2024-02-16,"How do you know that? How do you know apple will ever let anything near their store that does that? Are you willing to pay 99 dollars a year so you can install things without them expiring every week? 

Also, fuck off keyboard warrior, apple fanboy."
2024-02-15,"No, they mean 6dof tracked controllers, like the Quests have. Virtually no one wants to play VR games with a console controller."
2024-02-15,"It's not just about gaming though, it's about having the option to do literally anything that you can't already do on a Mac

You do you, but if you can't admit that this glorified google cardboard is objectively bad value, idk what to say."
2024-02-15,"You are an exception to the rule but what the other guy is saying is true about VR headsets when we look at the majority of owners and users currently. This is still a niche market most consumers have not even tried one on. Those who own them majority literally use them very rarely as the ""magic"" wears off. There aren't enough good games to keep me using mine daily as I use it mainly for gaming."
2024-02-15,"No stake in this discussion so far, but this statement is wrong

So many people like the UEVR (myself included), because it transforms a regular flat experience to the same 3rd person experience, but in VR. Which for me is like the best usecase of the UEVR"
2024-02-15,"You should demo one at an Apple Store, at least try it out."
2024-02-15,"Yea your probably right. I just think I have so much fun with mine I wonder why everybody doesn‚Äôt have a one.
I have friends that game but none of them like VR.
And I‚Äôve never liked multi player games but played a fair few in VR."
2024-02-15,"That‚Äôs a fair comment. I guess when I talk about gaming in VR, I mean VR native games. Blade and Sorcery, SuperHot VR, BoneLab, etc‚Ä¶ 

Playing flat-to-3D conversions (even then it seems some people want 6dof control in first person titles) is probably one of the few exceptions, along with driving/flight sims, where traditional controllers/peripherals are more desired."
2024-02-15,"I just got a quest and have a decent gaming PC, could you explain more about UEVR gaming?

From what I gather, you can play ‚Äúflat to VR‚Äù modded games. And is the UEVR the ‚Äúin engine‚Äù mod I‚Äôve been reading about? So if I play some of these games in VR then some of them would still want me to use keyboard and mouse while others would let me use my quest controllers?"
2024-02-15,"The only thing I would think that that would tell me is that the quality is good, which I'm not denying 

My point is having this crazy good quality is kind of irrelevant when you can only do, like, 3 things on it that you could just do on a laptop, and none of them are VR exclusive"
2025-01-30,The simple fact that I can play/stream HL Alyx with the Q3 makes it infinitely better than the AVP.
2025-01-30,"They are all ooh and ahhing over tech demos, like us back in 2016, over in r/Applevisionpro and they get soooooooo mad if you point it out.  

Like yes the display and eye tracking is nice. It damn well better be for that price. As if meta couldn't make that headset at that price. Any company could. The interface is nice too but hardly as revolutionary as they all try to make it out to be. 

That apple rally mesmerizes people."
2025-01-30,"Yes, by far. If AVP was better then a lot of us would buy it, regardless of the price. AVP is literally useless for many things we use Quest 3 for."
2025-01-30,"The display is mind blowing and MR clarity + neat tricks like realtime environment map and light estimation working flawlessly are on another level. Aside from that, yes worse in every way, having tried Vision Pro plenty 

It‚Äôs also -insanely restrictive- to get access to develop for with Unity far as licenses and even getting dev mode turned on for the device. Also Apple implemented only half of WebXR(no MR..)

I don‚Äôt get their plan with that second part. Maybe this is just a test run and don‚Äôt want people on there yet ü§î"
2025-01-30,"its definitely top notch in specs, but not super great otherwise"
2025-01-30,"Even if you said I could only use one regardless of cost, Quest 3. Better apps and controllers beats better screen and passthrough any day."
2025-01-30,"I initially purchased the Apple Vision Pro for media consumption but soon realized it might not justify its price for that purpose alone. Curious to explore alternatives, I decided to try the Meta Quest 3 to see if a more affordable option could deliver a comparable experience. While the AVP does offer superior clarity, the difference is not proportional to the significant price gap‚Äîit‚Äôs not seven times better, despite being seven times more expensive.

Ultimately, I returned the AVP and have been thoroughly satisfied with the MQ3 for media consumption. As a flight attendant, I bring it on all my trips, and it has significantly enhanced my downtime. Whether I‚Äôm enjoying a cinematic experience in my hotel room or playing a virtual round of golf, the MQ3 has proven to be one of the best purchases I‚Äôve made in recent years."
2025-01-30,"Got to agree with the Zuck on this one. AVP is amazing for watching films, especially 3D but also flat screen. That‚Äôs pretty much all I use it for but that‚Äôs enough for me. That and a bit of web browsing/social media after the film. I think of it as having bought myself a portable imax cinema. Great for travelling, great for relaxing but if I want to game or be immersed in VR environments I‚Äôm on the quest3. What I can no longer do (and I‚Äôd tried, using the Spatial App, before buying AVP) is read text/browse the web. It‚Äôs just not clear enough yet"
2025-01-30,"That‚Äôs because it is..

Zuck was right on this one."
2025-01-30,The apple vision pro is better as a monitor substitute if you're standing still and not really moving your head much. Like browsing the web or watching a movie on an airplane flight. The meta quest 3 is better as an immersive 3d experience including motion in a gaming context.   Different use cases.
2025-01-30,"I got surreal controllers, problem fixed for my avp pcvr gaming :)"
2025-01-30,It sounds like AVP has better technology but not anywhere near the amount of software and games Metaquest has.  I‚Äôll stick with my Metaquest 3 while there is far more to do on it.  MQ3 is a really good bit of tech and there is more being made for it.
2025-01-30,I do wish I could watch Disney plus' category of 3D films but they've made that exclusive to avp. How kind of them.
2025-01-30,"I have a hand difference and I‚Äôm a lefty. I did not like the AVP hand tracking though it did work even with my hands. It just takes a little more effort. I like the effortlessness I have with the Quest controllers better. 

Also very cool in games to see a fully functional normal hand, something I‚Äôve never had. Weird and fun at the same time. My hands rarely give me any issues but I can imagine the Quest is a bit more accessible for people that may miss an index finger for instance. Controllers can be adapted but not sure if handtracking in AVP can be? 

Also love the amount of games and the price of the headset, not having a separate battery to put in my pocket. Those count more for me than the screen resolution. The next Quest will probably come closer to AVP in that regard one day."
2025-01-30,Nope
2025-01-30,I think controllers + lack of wires going to the headset are just a massive W for Quest 3. Apple released a prototype and my guess would be it goes away for awhile and comes back in a few years when they can tie it into Apple Arcade somehow.
2025-01-30,Still haven‚Äôt used the AVP. I‚Äôve walked right past it twice at the mall Apple Store. I will not sully my eyes with that high priced foolishness.
2025-01-30,Quest 3 is better for the average person in all regards. AVP is better in general but is targeted more towards business use and rich people that wanna watch 3D movies.
2025-01-30,It simply is not with 10x the quest 3.
2025-01-30,"I tried the AVP and then bought a quest 3. The AVP is very much a first-gen device. Eye tracking is great, and the tracking of things in space is second to none. But I could buy my whole family a Quest 3 for the price. It also lacks software, because it‚Äôs also a dev kit piece of hardware. Not many devs had access to it before its release. So with that said I‚Äôm excited for the future of VR/XR in general and same with AVP. But it has to catch up on software and scale back the hardware to compete (drop the outer screen that shows your eyes)."
2025-01-30,"For the price, definitely."
2025-01-30,"Asking as the AVP is out of reach for most consumers there isn‚Äôt really a comparison. 

The Meta Quest experience is basically that of a game console, which is great. The out of the box experience to playing your first game is super streamlined. But it‚Äôs mainly geared to gaming and media consumption. 

When the first Apple Vission Pro was introduced it used the M1 chip, which at the time was a super powerful chip. In theorie this also ment that the Vission and MacBooks shared the same architecture and I really hoped that full desktop applications would be come available on the AVP. In theorie the AVP is more powerful, but for now it‚Äôs a glorified tech demo and newer versions are rumored to use the A series (iPhone) processors. I‚Äôm still interested in the AVP, but it needs more software and a lower price tag."
2025-01-30,I can see a time when I may consider getting a AVP but that is a long way off. The current AVP is very much (at least in my opinion) still in Beta stage. It's apple testing the water and seeing what works and what does not and to their credit they have always been very good at that. I am just not sure we will see AVP 2 showing up at WWDC or at a Town Hall Meeting in the next 3 years but I am ready to be wrong.
2025-01-31,The AVP is a developer kit that they decided to release as a ‚Äúconsumer product‚Äù. They knew a few wealthy Apple evangelists and a bunch of influencers would buy it if they did. In a few years we‚Äôll see a stripped down version for half the price. Current AVP owners are essentially just participating in a massive R&D project.
2025-01-31,"I have to say no, not even close, having spent time with every single modern standalone headset, controllers are the best for playing games and only that, the rest of the time their batteries die and it‚Äôs frustrating to get going when they have, especially if you have no access to spares, hand tracking is nowhere near as accurate on Quest and definitely not on Pico devices. The requirement to always create a boundary (scanned or drawn) in new locations on Quest as a real barrier and more annoying than not having controllers, Meta need to fix that and make it automatic like Vision Pro.
As much as I understand why controller access is important for gaming apps, the media viewing experience is second to non on Vision Pro and so it should be for the price."
2025-01-31,"Just a mindful that this comparison is pretty unfair in some ways. Apple is a 1st Gen device, with an App Library that fair exceeds even now what a 1st Gen iPhone had. Quest by comparison is on a 5th gen standalone device with many refinements and a level of product maturity.

If you placed Quest 1 or even Quest Pro side by side with Apple Vision Pro would this even be a comparison, likely not, flip is and put a 1st gen of any new XR device standalone against a 5th Gen Apple Vision product and most would likely say that‚Äôs not a fair comparison.

It‚Äôs apples and oranges, fords do similar things to Ferraris, have 4 wheels and a steering wheel, but they aren‚Äôt the same thing. Im not Vision Pro biased as I own both AVP & Quest, I‚Äôm just aware of what has come before these devices and what the bottle necks are on many. Vision Pro is far from perfect, but for a 1st Gen, the biggest major thing that lets it down is It‚Äôs price, I can live with everything else totally fine."
2025-01-31,Hardware perhaps not but access to software and price point make it far better value for money.  No point having a Bugatti if you can‚Äôt afford the petrol
2025-02-10,"I think Meta Quest 3 is better for the FOV alone. I think Apple made a huge mistake limiting the AVP's FOV like that. But also, the AVP is Apple's FIRST headset. The Quest 3 and 3s counts as Meta's 5th generation headset, and they really just acquired most of their tech from Occulus. I think once Apple hits their 3rd or 4th iteration of a headset, it's going to be amazing."
2025-01-30,The fact that the 300 dollar quest 3s isn‚Äôt selling like crazy is concerning as someone who wants to see the industry grow. The value proposition can not possibly be beaten. Frustrating knowing the switch will sell so much better despite being outdated in comparison to handhelds already on the market and not nearly the transformative experience and value that a 3s can provide.
2025-01-30,"Not for me but depends where you‚Äôre coming from. Vision Pro was my first headset too. I‚Äôm surprised in broad terms how simailr the experience is between the two but it‚Äôs like comparing the same game on switch to a 5090. It‚Äôs the same kinda game but corners have been cut. 

That‚Äôs said for 99% of people quest is better as has more games and VR experiences to fool around with. AVP has those too. YouTube on quest is appalling. You go from professionally produced Sabrina Carpenter concerts made by Meta that are pretty good to homemade VR footage from Harry Potter world someone shot that‚Äôs shakey and makes you feel sick. I don‚Äôt want that on viision pro thank you lol. 

Comparing purely high end VR video experiences I‚Äôd say apples has more at this point. 

Obvs game are. A huge deal on quest and I‚Äôm having a lot of fun with super hot - late to the party I know. 

One thing I never see spoken about is the situation is flipped when it comes to entertainment. When I got Vision Pro Apple upgraded over 100 of my movies to 3D for free. Disney plus has a 3D section of movies and obvs there regular movies and shows available on Apple. There is nothing like that on quest. I guess quest users just pirate content? Otherwise all there is, is Netflix?

The quest controllers are great, love the haptic feedback and if the rumours are true about PSVr2 controller compatibility for Vision Pro this year that would be great. 

I got a quest 3s to see how content I shoot for Vision Pro works on it. I was so impressed I‚Äôm returning it and getting a 3 this weekend. I‚Äôm Surprised at how into the games I am. But when I‚Äôm done with those I‚Äôm taking it off and going back to Vision Pro to watch a movie or get work done."
2025-01-30,You can stream PVCR games to AVP too
2025-01-30,Alien V Predator in VR would be epic !
2025-01-30,"Agreed, Apple should have paid Unity to remove the requirement for a pro license. That would have gone a long way towards alleviating the severe lack of content for AVP. My guess is that they didn‚Äôt want lots of diy hobbyist experiments polluting the store but that‚Äôs how new ecosystems get started. As it stands, the tech may be impressive but it‚Äôs all very sterile"
2025-01-31,"Exactly. I rented an $8K stereoscopic VR camera and tested the same exact immersive 180 degree footage on both headsets (I made sure to use the maximum quality settings for each). So this removed the ‚Äúquality of filmmaking variable‚Äù which Apple does a better job of on their immersive experiences. 

The AVP was clearer, more crisp, but not 7 times more crisp. Maybe it felt 20% more clear. The  low field of view on the AVP made me feel less immersed than Meta Quest."
2025-01-31,"I think you‚Äôre probably biased since you‚Äôve experienced the AVP. As a Quest 3 owner I use it to surf the web and productivity all the time. It‚Äôs definitely clear enough, it‚Äôs one of the main reasons I upgraded from my Quest 2. 

I can see feeling a little disappointed after having tried the AVP but since I don‚Äôt have that experience to compare it to, the Quest 3 is really impressive for me in that regard."
2025-01-30,It isn‚Äôt selling? I thought it was the top selling thing on amazon over Christmas outselling PlayStation and Xbox?
2025-01-30,"You buy into Nintendo for the games not for the console. Meta is still lacking great games with high quality. There is none that competes with games series like Mario, Zelda, Pokemon, Metroid, and so many more. 

The best Game for VR is until today HL Alyx. Not only for graphics but also for immersion and story. Nothing comes nearly to that quality."
2025-01-30,"3S is like a minor bump and most feels like a sidegrade from Quest2. If you going to game seriously, it‚Äôs a a regrettable purchase instead of a 3 (or keep waiting for 4 etc)

Well, that goes for very sweaty and demanding games like population one anyways(demanding as in, every frame and a higher refresh rate counts, besides obvious resolution bump). Quest3 was a noticeable bump closer to PCVR top tier players while 3S.. not as much.

If you one of the types who uses VR just to watch movies and casual games, prob slightly more worth it. Though, 3S has notable screen door still without the pancake lenses so even then idk"
2025-01-30,"Because normal people don't give two shits about VR. The people who are into VR want the better product. The Quest 3 is much better than the 3S and its only $200 more. For people into VR, the Quest 3 is a clear winner, and the only people buying VR headsets are people into VR."
2025-01-30,"Regarding YouTube, you definitely have to search for the good stuff, but it‚Äôs definitely there. For my purposes, I don‚Äôt really care about watching movies, just want to see what other content creators have made. I search ‚Äúvr 8k 180‚Äù and within this there are golden nuggets"
2025-01-30,Why the fuck are all yall downvoting a fact. The dude states a fact and gets downvoted? wtf is wrong with you people?
2025-01-30,"Yeah, it‚Äôs like they forgot how iOS went and some of the first breakout apps being things like flashlight and measuring tape as people just poked and prodded. Thats besides the indie games then too which thrived first for many years before studios would dive in 

I doubt Unity wanted that barrier at all. They are pretty gungho about XR and supporting them all. Has Apple written all over it and the half assed implementation of WebXR shows they really are up to usual shenanigans

Imagine if they had just implemented OpenXR and played ball. I hope they paid Unity handsomely for that headache of going their own path there"
2025-01-31,"I can‚Äôt argue with that, it‚Äôs only because I‚Äôm lucky enough to own an AVP that I find it difficult to go back to Quest3 for web browsing. That headset has great optics, such a large, clear eye box and much better FOV than AVP"
2025-01-30,If valves rumoured headset is true that‚Äôs like a steam deck for your face this year can play half life Alyx that‚Äôs going to sell a ton.
2025-01-30,"I‚Äôve got the Q3 but I‚Äôve heard that the 3s has an advantage in games like pop 1 and gorilla tag.  Because it‚Äôs got the same hardware but doesn‚Äôt have to process graphics like resolution and refresh rate as fast as the Q3‚Ä¶ it comes out faster in those multiplayer games where reaction time is everything.

I would get the Q3s for younger gamers."
2025-01-30,"Sure, I think that‚Äôs my issue. I don‚Äôt want to hunt through 100 videos to find a nugget. I just want good quality stuff presented to me. And don‚Äôt want the next video that auto plays to make me feel sick. 

Apple may only have 20ish immersive videos but they are consistently high quality. On meta tv the Sabrina carpenter and Charli xcx concerts err great but that‚Äôs really all I‚Äôve found. Happy to be pointed to more good quest content. 

It‚Äôs the reverse of games on Vision Pro. I love beat punch and void. It‚Äôs incorrect to say there are no good games on Vision Pro but there are nuggets you have to hunt for. 

Another interesting comparison Is I‚Äôve spent 100+ hours in Vision Pro and never felt sick. Half a day playing with the 3s and I had to stop because I felt ill. I know people talk about getting your vr sea legs but that‚Äôs simply not an issue with the Vision Pro. I don‚Äôt know why it happens.maybe the quest 3 is better for that. 

I‚Äôm big into entertainment and love the movies and tv shows on Vision Pro. But if all you want is games and most people do quest is the better headset by far"
2025-01-31,Probably because you‚Äôd have streaming artifacts (no option for wired connection) and it doesn‚Äôt even come with the controllers so you‚Äôd have to either buy a pair or use a janky hand tracking setup. The quest 3 is just going to be a much better experience for PCVR.
2025-01-31,Thanks üôè I guess it is a quest group and I mentioned the opposition. üòÖ But honestly I love the quest. Both are for very different things. I love the quest so much that I bought a 3s and am returning it and have a 3 coming today.  I‚Äôm blown away by how fun it is. But that doesn‚Äôt mean the VP sucks.
2025-01-31,I mean it can but it's 7 times the price for a much more difficult experience.
2025-01-30,That‚Äôs very astute. Never thought of Apple actually paying Unity to keep up the wall garden but it makes a lot of sense
2025-01-30,"No idea about gorilla tag but no, for pop1 the Q3 is much preferred from feedback seen here(it‚Äôs sub) of people returning them for a Q3 and also heard in game from squamates who felt bamboozled 

Resolution is extremely important for it, given its main modes are ginormous BR maps and players are quite far away a lot of times.

When you add the 3S‚Äôs lower FOV, screen door effect and smaller resolution, it‚Äôs a show stopper for games like that

They both run at 120hz for pop1 now which is good at least"
2025-01-31,There are hand controllers for Vision Pro with an app that links to steam VR. And PSVR2 controllers are being made compatible with Vision Pro later this year.
2024-12-20,"I've heard it's better, but not enough to justify the cost."
2024-12-20,"Most YouTube VR3D 180 videos are pretty poor quality, regardless of which headset you use. Downloading the videos with either Premium or other means helps some, but the content itself is the main limiting factor."
2024-12-21,"I own both‚Ä¶. 

The Vision Pro there‚Äôs no dedicated YouTube app you have to use the browser and I find it incredibly annoying. 

And usually the problem with the VR video is the source material not being high res enough or streamed at a high enough res. You‚Äôd still have that problem with the vision pro as well as the browsers vr video player sucking bad.  

But if we‚Äôre just talking normal 2d YouTube videos‚Ä¶.  Yeah, watching them in the Vision Pro is way better.  It‚Äôs borderline as good as a home theater setup."
2024-12-21,"I had Quest 3 but after trying Vision Pro, good bye Quest. I mostly use for multimedia and immersive stuff. Games here or there and also ps5 remote play. Plus spatial pictures is so amazing. The displays on Vision Pro are on another level. I can never go back to LCD displays again. Not that Quest 3 is bad but if you have the means and want the most advanced headset on the planet at the moment, it‚Äôs the Vision Pro. And I only paid half for it :)"
2024-12-20,"When it comes to videos, the quality of the source video is usually an issue. 


I doubt YouTube will look much better on AVP, for example. 


For VR180 video, you need at least 8k or more to not seem pixellated.


Sliceoflifevr's patreon has high resolution videos for download, sometimes he offers free demos.  (Otherwise the usual source for high res vr180 videos is porn.)


Download a 8k or better VR180 video onto your Quest, play it with a VR media like DeoVR, to see what your Q3 can do at its best. 


Apple's exclusive content will be even better, but like I said, I don't think most YouTube videos will be much different."
2024-12-20,"probably because the videos you watch don't have enough pixels

[https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/1hdnvjj/comment/m1xtmdu/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/1hdnvjj/comment/m1xtmdu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)"
2024-12-20,"It's slightly better (perceivable) resolution wise; the software and processing power really helps it run smoother overall though.  Eye tracking is a huge plus for the AVP.  And passthrough is a lot crisper.  However, not worth the price tag when the O3 can be obtained for 1/8th the price"
2024-12-20,"Vision Pro blows anything else on the market out of the water. I have even started using it as a full-time monitor replacement. If you can afford it it‚Äôs the best way to watch movies/tv/youtube, especially when paired with some noise canceling headphones."
2024-12-20,So where can I find the best videos? I want to travel to different countries or ride in a race car haha
2024-12-21,Which one do you prefer?
2024-12-21,That‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm looking for multimedia and immersive stuff. I feel like the Quest 3‚Äôs resolution / clarity is not the best. I want something better.
2024-12-21,Should I get it or wait for the Vision Pro 2?
2024-12-21,"Most advanced my ass. Put price aside, if you achieved more with same weight or same power consumption, then ok, maybe it's more advanced. But it uses twice of weight, twice of power consumption to achieve not even 1.5 more visual enhancement, and sometimes backwards (lower FOV, higher persistence, lower brightness, defeated the purpose of HDR)."
2024-12-20,Where can I download DeoVR?
2024-12-20,Should we just wait for the AVP 2 to come out?
2024-12-20,I was concerned that my Quest 3 wasn‚Äôt working properly when watching YouTube videos because the resolution didn‚Äôt look crystal clear. Are you suggesting that the Vision Pro offers much better clarity?
2024-12-20,"[Slice of Life VR](https://m.youtube.com/@SliceoflifeVR) is the only one I know of that's doing really high quality travel style videos. There might be others on Patreon.

...and of course there's ""adult"" videos if you pay for a one-time monthly subscription, download as many videos on your PC as you have storage for and then don't opt to pay for a second month. They tend to use very expensive cameras and since you are required to download, not stream the quality is quite good.

Not that I would suggest that to anyone."
2024-12-21,"Depends on the use case.  

For watching stuff it‚Äôs the Vision Pro and not close (although 180/360 content is so annoying to run on the device right now I‚Äôd usually use the Quest 3).  And there aren‚Äôt an outlandish amount of 3d movies to watch on the Vision Pro but those are just great.  A real treat.  

The screen on the Vision Pro‚Ä¶.  Makes me very sad the Quest 3 doesn‚Äôt have that screen lol.  

But‚Ä¶. I could rant all day about how the Vision Pro kind-of sucks too.  What I would really like is a Quest 3 with the Vision Pro‚Äôs screen and Quest Pro controllers haha.  All this tech exists but I feel like I‚Äôm gonna be waiting a very long time if there is no Quest Pro 2 and Quest 4 is budget until anything like this exists."
2024-12-21,You could be waiting until 2026 or later but honestly nobody really knows when Vision Pro 2 coming. If you can get this one now just get it and enjoy it. Have fun.
2024-12-21,"Yup still most advanced, but keep trying lol"
2024-12-21,It's free on the Quest store.
2024-12-20,"Apple is working on two headsets: a cheaper Vision, and the Pro 2. The cheaper model will likely make major concessions to get the price down. The Pro 2 will be just as expensive as the Pro. Both are at least a year or two away from market."
2024-12-20,"Vision Pro is crystal clear. The passthrough still has some slight grain, but that‚Äôs due to the cameras rather than the screen. When in a fully immersive experience it does not feel like you‚Äôre looking at a screen. 

Highly recommend trying one out before buying tho. All Apple Stores have free demos."
2024-12-20,VR porn is amazing haha
2024-12-20,Would it look better on the AVP?
2024-12-21,Why is the 180/360 content on the Vision Pro annoying?
2024-12-21,"I remember decade ago I saw some knock off chinese phones with advertisement like ""our phone have 12 core processor and your iphone only have 2"", So you are kind of guy would fall for these kinds of advertisement lol"
2024-12-20,"I will go try it out. The price doesn't concern me since Apple offers an excellent payment plan. I recently bought the Meta Quest 3, and I love it. However, I'm not a big gamer. I want to explore more VR technology, such as being immersed inside an airplane or a race car, or taking video tours of different countries. I‚Äôm looking for better clarity in the experience."
2024-12-20,"That's amazing! Can you teleport to different environments on the AVP? Quest 3 does, but the resolution is not super clear."
2024-12-20,"I would assume so, but not $3000 better than Quest 3."
2024-12-21,Largely because Safari is the actual worst (it could get fixed by a software update one day).  When you enter 3d mode it loses eye tracking which is how you interact with everything in the device.  So you have to physically move your head to try to adjust settings and it‚Äôs something you‚Äôll def want to do because it kind-of sucks watching all videos standing perfectly upright vs. your floor.
2024-12-21,"There‚Äôs nothing to fall for here. What we even talking about here lol. This ain‚Äôt some cheap knock off lol. You just can‚Äôt admit it but that‚Äôs ok, your opinion doesn‚Äôt change anything. Go ahead and find me a more advanced legit vr/ar headset that is above the Vision Pro. 

I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a perfect headset or it doesn‚Äôt have flaws but overall it‚Äôs the most advance piece of vr/ar hardware you can buy as a consumer. Whether you hate or love or you can afford it or not.

You want the best value? Of course get a Quest 3 it blows it away there and would be my recommendation to most people. But bleeding edge tech today? Yeah it‚Äôs not a Quest 3."
2024-12-20,"Yeah, Quest is great for gaming but I found myself only playing VR games once every few weeks. Since getting the Vision Pro it‚Äôs been a daily driver for me, and completely replaced my phone/laptop/PC/tablet for home compute use."
2024-12-20,"Yes, there are a handful of environments on VP that are photo-real. My favorite is Bora Bora!

https://youtu.be/bKueDGv4OVQ?si=NdxYQ34Lx6y-AC-x"
2024-12-20,$3000 is crazy
2024-12-21,"I recently purchased the Meta Quest 3, and I love it overall. However, I'm not impressed with the video quality and resolution. The VR videos available on Meta don‚Äôt appear crystal clear, and the virtual environments you can use while multitasking don‚Äôt look very sharp either. I'm curious if the AVP offers better video quality. I'm considering keeping the Quest 3 for gaming and possibly getting the AVP for videos and other media. But I needed some input before spending $3k on a VR device haha."
2024-12-25,"Define bleeding edge tech, or advance in this regard. The only thing that AVP has is that it has bigger numbers in some respect while sacrifice the others, and you can only apply that to AVP has some advantage in certain areas, but not majority certainly not all, thus, it's not more advanced at all. Or, if they solved any major technical problems or provided any new paradigms, I would be willing to give them that. But nothing. Nothing at all. It's a glorified knockoff of Quest and Reality Labs research without any contribution to the field."
2024-12-20,Thank you so much for your input!
2025-01-06,It‚Äôs $3000 better
2024-12-21,"Personally‚Ä¶.  I think the Vision Pro is a dev kit. 

That said‚Ä¶.  I think if you desperately want to watch 2d video content in VR and hate actual TVs for some reason.   It‚Äôs prob the best you can do right now and a solid experience.

And I know I‚Äôm trashing it a little but I do actually really like watching 2d content in it now and again. Kind-of lets me focus on what I‚Äôm watching as weird as that sounds."
2025-01-06,Really?
2024-12-21,Well the Vision Pro would be a bigger tv haha. How‚Äôs the 3D content?
2025-01-06,Do you have an Apple Store near you?
2024-12-21,It‚Äôs the best 3d movie watcher in existence.
2025-01-06,I do!
2025-01-06,"So‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt take this the wrong way as rude, but why haven‚Äôt you just gone and experienced it for yourself?"
2025-01-06,"I will, but before I do, I was curious to ask other people's perspectives first."
2025-01-06,"Gotcha! I mean, i think this subforum has an averse hatred towards Apple, so I‚Äôm really not sure it‚Äôs the best way to gauge anything. I‚Äôd pick the best rated Apple Store in your area (or your favorite), book an appointment time, and do it at a time of day when the least amount of people are going to be there. I think Google has a function where it shows you how many people are usually there on any day you pick.¬†

The $3000 difference isn‚Äôt just display quality. It‚Äôs everything. It‚Äôs difference in the philosophy of the product, the UI and UX, the real OS with real APIs for the future, the design, the quality and fit and finish. You‚Äôre paying a premium for an experience you can‚Äôt get anywhere else at the moment at the same level of quality. If you‚Äôre willing to spend a bunch of money to get access to tomorrow‚Äôs tech today, that‚Äôs only up to you. But there‚Äôs absolutely a difference in everything between these two devices.

Also some tips: if you feel too much pressure on your cheeks, move the Solo Knit band down. If it feels too much pressure on your forehead, move the Solo Knit band further up. Remember; it should feel secure, not tight, when adjusting the Fit Dial, and the optimal place is *usually* further up your head than you may think, near the crown of your head).¬†

If you buy, there are also very high quality bands that match the type of materials Apple uses, like the Kontor headband:¬†https://www.resmed.com/en-us/kontor/vision-pro/

If you have any more questions or ideas let me know"
2025-01-06,"I love Apple. I have a MacBook Pro, Apple Watch and iPhone 16 Pro Max. I recently purchased a Meta Quest 3 and I wasn't very impressed with the quality. That's why I'm asking about the AVP. Thank you for your feedback!"
2024-02-03,"I have both. I was also one of the first 200 people to Kickstart the original Oculus DK. I have every Quest, HTC, and even a Pimax.  


The Vision Pro is absolutely a better visual experience, with the exception of mura. But for browsing photos and watching movies, it's top of the line. No, it's not worth \~$3000 more, but we pay a premium for that last 10%. It's just how it goes.  


The Quest 3 is definitely more mature, but the sharpness and contrast of the Vision Pro is undeniable. At $1499, it would be very serious competition. The outward-facing OLED is a waste of money and unnecessary. Just put a few LEDs on the front. The wired power pack is annoying and, especially compared to the BoboVR strap, the Vision has a weird fit. For me, anyway. Battery life leaves much to be desired.  


But you can see Apple is trying something new here. A computer system you can wear. It's not games forward where Quest excels. It's like the first-generation iPad. You can see where they're heading, and this is the end game: A lightweight, wearable computer that looks like reality with augmented windows and visuals. Now we wait for the apps to come and firmware upgrades. Don't forget home many quality of life improvements came after the Quest, Quest 2, and Quest 3 via firmware.  


For now, the Vision Pro passthrough is *good*. I said that a tad disappointed because it should be better for the price. Each eye camera should be 6K with better dynamic range. It's slightly washed out. And damn, that mura/motion blur is *distracting*. But I suspect 2.0 will fix that.  


In the meantime, developers will try it and figure out what innovations they can bring. Meta has, in a way, boxed themselves into a gaming console corner because of the price point and feature set. Sure, you have Virtual Desktop, but Vision Pro does that better (even though the mouse stutters when I share my MacBook screen.) The integration with the Mac (and Disney) infrastructure, however, is undeniably powerful.   


I love the Quest 3 and the price is fantastic, but you simply can't compare the two. The Vision Pro is looking to replace computers. The Quest Pro didn't come anywhere near as this.  


In the meantime, the Vision Pro takes absolutely nothing from the Quest 3. If anything, it highlights how amazing they've done with lower-cost hardware."

2024-02-03,"It's basically an expensive dev kit in my eyes, I can see some companies buying them to develop apps with for when consumer ones hit the market in a couple years, to get a head start.

For now...I wouldn't suggest any average person to buy one, it's a first try, it's apple, they do this...it's not even surprising really...when the iphone came out I knew one person that had one, everyone else had cheaper average phones, now I know tons with them.

The key difference is it's not marketed at us even, it's near 4k with tax, it doesnt have controllers, and most of us at this point use the quest for gaming(most..some like it for other stuff, but it's marketed, even in commercials as a gaming device)."

Shakes head, quest 3 uses 2 panels, and has better fov then apple pro.

matter of fact before quest 3 came out, this was this subs worry, single panel with same fov as quest 2, turned out it was 2 panals and better fov of any quest headset yet. Which was a welcome surprise along with the clarity bump. All that missing now is 4k panels but that massive upgrade will be for quest 4/quest pro 2 in the years ahead.


At least he got ending right, quest 3 > apple pro for real life uses. lmfao"

2024-03-08,"Im a former corporate video producer, and once paid $3,500.00 for a Canon 5D Mark III the week it came out in 2013. it paid for itself within less than a year in video and photo work. I still have it and it still works great. That‚Äôs for context. This week, I went down to the Apple Store and went through their guided demo. The whole experience of that was extremely well thought out, from the presentation of the device to the whole demo. It was the first time in a long time I felt like I had stepped into a sci fi movie for real. It was literally jaw dropping. When I found out the device could take immersive 3D photos and videos, like the ones in the demo, I stopped thinking of it as a VR headset and started thinking of it as a literal memory capture device. If you go and try the demo you will see what I mean. It \*felt\* like they literally reinvented photography, that what they created is a device that captures and stores literal memories as they happened. If I could have had this thing, and captured moments with my mother before she died with the visual and audio reproduction it offers, I would have paid $10,000.00 for it. But it‚Äôs too heavy, made my eyes hurt after wearing it 15 minutes, and they didn‚Äôt even add a small internal battery to make the external battery pack hot-swappable, which in my opinion is an unforgivable design flaw. Otherwise yes I would buy it for the same reason I bought an actual pro camera. The value isn‚Äôt the device but the experiences it offers, which literally no other consumer device can do (3D photos and video of the quality it makes)."
2024-02-03,"LOL! Everyone taking the bait.

Apples v1‚Äôs are always exciting and generate chatter, but v2 will be adopted by the masses after they see its leaps and bounds better than the first one, cheaper, and much, much deliberated over for a year.

2024-02-14,"After 24 hours of testing the VisionPro, and having worn it for hours of work, along with a few months of the Quest3, I can say that:

‚ñ™ At the hardware level, I don't see a big difference between the two devices for now, except for some advantages highlighted by Mark (weight and cable) on one side, and greater interaction sensitivity (eye tracking and hand tracking) on the other.  
‚ñ™ There is no doubt that they are two different devices and, in my opinion, not directly comparable, especially in terms of purpose.

If I were to think about gaming, there is no doubt that I would lean towards the Quest3 (for now), but for work, extending the space of my ecosystem (mac, iPhone), I would undoubtedly consider the VisionPro.

I continue to believe that the difference between the two devices is not to be found in hardware, as many are doing, but in other aspects:

‚ñ™ Applicative ecosystem: There is no doubt that being on board with one's own account, with everything (photos, documents, passwords, contacts, devices, configurations, services), is a unique advantage and an accelerator of use and onboarding.  
‚ñ™ User Experience: The system of recognition, mapping, and scanning of eyes and hands is perfectly in line with Apple's style (frictionless).  
‚ñ™ Purpose and usage: This is an important point because each of us will use the device for our own objective, mode of use, and purpose. In the vision of the two devices, there is in my opinion, before they begin to converge towards each other, a different target user and a different vision of usage. Meta positions itself as a means of centralizing the mixed reality experience, while Apple positions itself as an extension of the existing experience in an extended concept of Spatial Computing."
2024-03-04,"So much for less? The Quest 3 is an excellent headset for the price and is undoubtedly better for gaming. The smooth sailing stops there, though. I cannot find anything else the quest comes remotely close to winning so I'm not sure what you mean by 'less'. 

The passthrough on the Quest is terrible, the UI is awful and the screens subpar. These things make a huge difference. 

Your comment is akin to someone who can't understand why anyone would buy a Tesla when their Subaru Impreza does the same thing but more; ""I can get from A to B just like a Tesla, and it goes further than 100km on a tank"". 

These types of comments reek of either naivety or willful ignorance. You may not like Apple, but their headset, while it has many flaws, is an impressive piece of tech. As to how much value people place on it is a different story. Like someone buying a 100"" 4k OLED TV vs someone getting a 60"" 4K QLED; the buyer decides if its worth it to them."

2024-02-04,"Meta boxed themselves in? I wonder if you would say the same if Vision Pro shipped with controllers and some games.

If meta releases Quest Pro 2 for $2,000 that comes close to vision pro‚Äôs resolution/lens clarity there is absolutely no reason to get the Vision Pro. 

Also l, like someone else pointed out, nobody will seriously wear this thing on their face for hours for work instead of looking at their Mac.

2024-02-04,"You put words into my mouth:  


>Meta has, in a way, boxed themselves into a gaming console corner because of the price point and feature set. 

I said ""in a way"" specifically because of price point and feature set (e.g. specific gaming features, like controllers). If Meta releases a $2,000 Quest Pro 2, as you hypothesized, it's no longer the same price point and feature set, so sure it can do similar things.  


Where I disagree is that it's missing the Apple ecosystem: Macs, iPhones, AppleTV, and partnerships with companies like Disney. And, of course, the entire development community around it.  Apple, by market cap, is over twice the size. That can make a difference.  


Meta will have a more difficult time getting businesses to trust it and not having any other hardware platforms is part of the problem.  


Gaming, the Quest's current sweet spot, has a much lower barrier to entry than a phone or computer system. Also, Meta had the chance to do this with Pro for $1,500 and it bombed. It was nowhere near what I'm seeing with the Vision Pro. Sure, it's still less than half the price, but they tried a ""Pro"" already and it didn't find its footing.   


There's no guarantee Apple will either."
2024-02-04,"That's a great question. What is a ""real computer""? It depends on your needs. Would I code on this? Absolutely not. At least until they had rock-solid keyboard and mouse support. If they did, I think it could work well.

To your point, it has a lot in common with the iPad. Right now, it's probably best for media ingestion. Spacial videos and panoramas elicit a more emotional response as if you're entering a memory, as oppose to a flat photo. That said, I know a lot of people who do professional work, like Procreate or writing, on an iPad. (With a Pencil and keyboard, of course, so there we go back to accessories again.) It does have Microsoft 365. Much of it comes down to inputs. The Quest, for example, has great gaming inputs, which makes it a better gaming system.

I'd love to see where they go with accessories, but for now the limiting factor of it being a ""real computer"" isn't the display or processor, but the controls. There's only so much you can do with a pinch and hand gestures. They're slow and clunky. You can peck at a virtual keyboard with an index finger. But that's tedious for real work.

But give me that keyboard and mouse option. Or a new type of stylus for modeling and painting in 3D. Connect an Xbox or PS5 controller, and I can see a very capable gaming ""computer."" If they can get it small enough, like a pair of glasses and a pack in your pocket, I can see it used for productivity on the go, a bit like an Apple Watch meets an iPhone with augmented reality.

The fun is seeing where developers and consumers take it. And I'm not quite sure Apple even knows yet."
2024-02-04,"That‚Äôs literally how the world works, though. Either people will pay for that extra 10% (obviously that‚Äôs not a real quantifiable number) or they won‚Äôt. But the highest end of everything, from watches to video cards to clothes to cars, almost always costs disproportionately more than the increase in quality.

I don‚Äôt mind as much, particularly in innovative tech, because it accelerates adoption and brings higher end units to the masses faster."
2024-07-20,"It‚Äôs not perfect, but it tracks and refreshes really well. The downsides are the mura/streaking on the OLED panels and the cameras could be better. They‚Äôre a bit darker and noisier than ‚Äúreal life.‚Äù It‚Äôs completely usable, but not quite ‚ÄúReal Life.‚Äù You can see how close they‚Äôre getting, though. And most of the time it‚Äôs good enough. 

The in-unit image, like the UI, photos, and video are better than the camera images. So it‚Äôs definitely a camera fix. Then they have to fix OLED artifacts and some eye lens reflections and it‚Äôll be golden. Maybe with each eye at 8K instead of 4K."
2024-02-06,"Vision Pro has a better overall VR experience (with the exception of mura and refresh rate). The contrast, resolution, and colors are much more vibrant. As a VR enthusiast, this is the resolution and visual fidelity I was waiting for. 

Passthrough is *significantly* higher quality than Quest 3, but not perfect. I'm disappointed they didn't put dual 4Ks to match the quality of the screens.

For games, Quest is *absolutely* better today. It's yet to be seen how hands will work compared to controllers, but who knows what developers will do? It just came out. The Quest DK didn't come out of the gates with the best games. Everyone was drooling over around a blurry 3D model of a villa in Tuscany. 

Battery life is somewhat comparable, but form factor is definitely worse with the external pack.  


But, most of all, I think you're missing that it's like comparing a sports car to an SUV. They're currently different use cases. Sure, they're both ""cars"" that can drive you somewhere, so there's certainly overlap.  


But you know what I can't do on my Quest? Open my laptop and its screen turns off automatically. Now, I have ANY size screen hovering over the keyboard. My 15"" is now a 27"" \~4K monitor. And off to the side are windows with my mail and text messages. In the background can be a movie or TV show. It's recreating the concept of the office space and how and where we use computers. Next, wait for it to track your iPhone so you have a perfect high-resolution screen. Imagine dragging attachments and photos from your MacBook to your phone with a pinch.  


It's redefining how we think about computers. As I said: "" The Vision Pro takes absolutely nothing from the Quest 3. If anything, it highlights how amazing they've done with lower-cost hardware."""
2024-02-14,"Hey. Good question. 

The AVP‚Äôs primary benefit is the whole ‚Äúspacial computer‚Äù aspect. It feels somewhere between an iPad and MacBook Air in terms of power. 

I was a bit disappointed at first, considering the price, but the ‚Äúah ha‚Äù moment came when I looked at my MacBook and it had a ‚Äúconnect‚Äù button floating above it. I clicked it, and the MacBook screen turned off, replaced by a virtual screen. And then I could resize it. My 15‚Äù laptop could be a 30‚Äù or 100‚Äù. 

Then, I could use various apps, dedicated or one of millions (?) of iPad apps. I could put Messages on to the side, Music or YouTube on the other side. 

It was like when I first got a second monitor but it was all virtual. Everything locked perfectly into place in my room (or a virtual environment). The hand gestures and eye gaze made everything more precise. I envisioned all the potential input hardware it might eventually track, from a Pencil to standalone keyboard (as opposed to a Mac) to gaming controllers. 

I felt, and continue to feel, like I can be genuinely productive. Not ‚Äúmostly productive‚Äù and trying to force it. I was answering emails and using my MacBook keyboard with zero trade offs. In fact, my screen was larger and decluttered. Anything requiring typing was on the virtual Mac display while anything with eye-gazes or swipes was off to the side. It was very ‚ÄúMinority Report.‚Äù

Another example is the taking and playback of spacial videos. It‚Äôs pretty magical to be ‚Äúin‚Äù a picture. Being able to take decent stereoscopic photos and videos in the AVP or iPhone 15 is very cool. (I know Meta quickly added the ability to view them but taking them is also important to me.)

There‚Äôs more but they‚Äôre related to the image quality, so they‚Äôre not particularly ‚Äúnew‚Äù but feel that way for me because I‚Äôm really into home theater. Having that 4K per eye and being able to watch stereo films in 48fps feels totally new to me, despite being incremental to most people. I didn‚Äôt love Avatar 2, but I never thought I be watching it at home nearly equal to a high end Dolby Cinema. 

Simply, with the Quest I‚Äôve always seen the future of VR, with the AVP I see the future of computing. Of course, the Quest has a bunch of overlapping functionality (and is really good at adding features) so it‚Äôs not so clear cut. Hopefully that example helps answer your question without getting into a spec/resolution/price battle."

Sure, the AVP does a lot better in many ways, but nothing 7x better to justify the price. The Q3 matches and beats it in some areas.

If I had unlimited money the Q3 would still be the better headset for my needs/wants, maybe (hopefully) that changes soon enough as more stuff is created for the AVP.

The AVP does enough right that I'm very excited for its next iteration, and for all the competition it will inspire, but unless you are already deep into the Apple ecosystem it does nothing to justify the cost."

Imagine this at scale (which Tim Cook obviously hasn't). Imagine everyone in the office, or grocery store, is wearing a Vision Pro. Wouldn't everyone you see be an avatar in some form? Maybe the guy in the corner office is an ass, and he has a horse's ass for a face in your view of the world. I won't need to see their eyes.

The outward screen is for people *not using* a Vision Pro, and I would assume that most people who can neither afford one, or have use for one, would simply ask the person using it to take it off for a moment, or simply ignore it.

By capturing the VR and gaming market they are giving AR developers a big ecosystem to build in to. Their end goal is similar to Apple. Apple is simply the only company that can leverage their brand loyalty to sell a $3500 developer unit. I think what‚Äôs in Metas pipeline (codec avatars, Seamless translator, phone based 3d object import, neural interface, multimodal ai etc) is far more impressive than what I‚Äôve seen on the Vision Pro and points to their real aim as a communications and computing company when the market for high end headsets opens up. I don‚Äôt care that Quest Pro 1 flopped because Meta has been taking risks and refining their strategy for 10 years.

The performance delta between them is like comparing a Wii-U to a Switch or a Wii to a GameCube.  These are healthy steps up but it‚Äôs not like 6x the performance delta.

The goal of putting on the headset is to go somewhere else. That's its primary. What to see a boxing match and be in the arena? What to watch World Cup matches live but not on TV? What to dive under the ocean and explore the Titantic? This should be the focus of all headsets, you put on the set to go somewhere while not actually going. Hell, newly released movies and films could be in these sets as well. Movie theaters would hate it, but I'm sure magazines & newspapers hated the internet.

Genuinely the screen is better, hand tracking is better, eye tracking, plus it's packaged in the clean, tight apple ecosystem. It's gonna be a really cool product that pushes VR forward. But as it is now there aren't any apps or games and it's a glorified productivity machine with design flaws and expensive gimmicks

It's extremely fair to compare it to what little else is out there to compare it to. Given that some things on the meta quest 3 are better or on par with something 7x its cost, it's fair to compare them.."

Outside of fanboying/fangirling over the Apple Vision Pro, I've yet to see any real reason it is better than the Quest 3 outside of ""display.""

One has utility and cutting-edge tech; the other looks nicer and is six times more expensive. I landed on this thread because I genuinely don't get the hype of the AVP.

  
So unless you do value the VR experience of the AVP so much, or you are an Apple cult member, or yes, you are both of these things, but you can't afford it, then this $3500 ""face computer"" is not for you.

Seems pretty reasonable though.

Who knows, maybe they are missing something and the more expensive version does have something that could be enticing. 

I'd be willing to drop 3 grand on the AVP if it offered twice as much as the Quest 3 personally, but it seems more like a side grade overall while being 7x as expensive."

When I clicked it, the screen turned off and it was replaced by a screen in the Vision Pro. Only I could turn the 15"" screen into a 20"" or 100"". It was oriented exactly to my laptop. It didn't track it, but that's how it originally opened. The experience was flawless. I could use the MacBook's keyboard and trackpad, but have any size screen I'd like. And I could have other screens, like mail or a web browser, floating off to the right. This is a very cool use case for me. Now you can get a 13"" laptop, but turn it into a 25"" or 30"". And you can have multiple screens pretty easily.   


Granted, this is with a separate laptop, but imagine it did this with a small keyboard and mouse (or trackpad), where it tracked the keyboard so you now have a ""virtual laptop.""

2024-02-08,"Very interesting option for streamers/studios here no? 

Disney is searching for the answer to make Disney+ profitable....what if they offer movie theatre, or slightly lower, prices to rent a film in their own Virtual Theatre environment? Not available under the standard subscription, but maybe replacing the DVD sale by offering this experience a couple of weeks after the film debuts in theatres?

There are big holes to fill here, but maybe Vision Pro is the marketplace Disney+ has been looking for?

Either way - I'd love the option. The things I want to be able to do in VR/AR:

1. Watch my own film/television collection, and live media on huge screens;
2. Inhabit 3D Spaces, either real or created;
   1. Watching live sports as if I'm in the crowd or on the sideline/touchline/rinkside/courtside etc 
   2. Tour areas of the world virtually in a semi-realistic manner
3. Replace a laptop
   1. Be able to create virtual screens (as many as I want) to work from in the same way I work on any physical computer screen.
   2. Play the same games I can play on a gaming laptop (and preferably more)
4. Do all this on a headset that I am comfortable wearing for 3-5 hours at  a time, and has a battery to last at least this amount of time while viewing media (streaming a film/watching a game/etc)

This would be worth somewhere around $2000 CAD to me.

I am not overly concerned who produces this - but I certainly think Apple are very well positioned to take advantage of their ecosystem, and their relationship with Disney to make this happen. 

It might even save Disney+, and conceivably make Apple TV+ an absolute necessity as the ultimate subscription service, if they could bring a bunch of these things together (Film experiences, TV, and Live Sports in an immersive environment).

Vision Pro COULD really be the ""next big thing"" if Apple can work out the relationships and get the price down."
2024-02-04,"I said that's how the world works, not how I live my life. I go for bang for the buck, with some exception on new technology where there are limited options (like the Vision Pro). For example, I moved from a MacBook Pro to an Air M2 because it's significantly cheaper and does everything I need (with a better battery and lighter weight). I still don't have a 4000 series GeForce because the 3090 is fine for the amount and type of gaming/work I do. I typically skip generations.

As someone else noted, the yield on Vision Pro screens is like 20%. Early adopters pay the price. I identify market trends for large companies (and the federal court system), so I like to stay on top of the latest consumer technology.

There's always a sweet spot, and I look for it. If you go too cheap, like with furniture or power tools, you could buy two or three before a single ""expensive"" one wears out, ultimately paying more. It's all about lifetime value and resale for me."
2024-07-20,"I have a 4K laser projector in a home theater and watching movies is a good if not better, if not for the weight on my head. Even though it‚Äôs not ‚ÄúTrue 4K‚Äù of the movie per eye, I believe the fact each eye has a dedicated display increases the overall sense of resolution. 

In other words, you normally look at a 4K or Retina display with two eyes. The AVP uses less of the display, but each eye gets its own and I believe it gives you a higher ‚Äúperceived resolution.‚Äù Also, 3D is fantastic because each eye has a dedicated display. 

A lot of people don‚Äôt realize we had movies on full size theater screens at 2K for a long time and nobody complained about screen doors or pixels.

2024-02-03,"You're missing the point: It doesn't work. I have one.

It doesn't add to the social interaction. It makes it creepier. Maybe the execution is off or it's unnecessary. The public will decide. In my opinion, the headset is still too bulky, so it's an awkward attempt.

When they're thin and a screen can be created that looks photorealistic and in the proper position exactly at the plane of the eyes, it might work. But right now, it's something that sound great but doesn't work particularly well in practice, like 3D touch or the MacBook Touchbar.

It's clear they're still experimenting. Try doing a Facetime or Zoom call with that ""Persona"" and it looks like nightmare fuel. The first person I called said I looked like a Playstation 4 character. How is that making the social experience better?

There's a reason Meta made their avatars ""cartoony."" Because they know uncanny valley is *worse*. And they've sold millions more headsets than Apple at this point. So, sure, dismiss a stranger on the Internet, but Meta has been doing this for a long time and knows how to produce a mass-market headset."
2024-02-04,"I suspect they‚Äôre going to need to get under $2,000 because companies like Meta will have higher resolution systems soon. If I was Apple, I‚Äôd be more concerned about the experience of the user paying for the product than what others see. 

Let‚Äôs face it, if you‚Äôre not into VR, they all look ridiculous with or without screens. I am into VR and think I look ridiculous in a Quest or Vision Pro. The last thing I want is to pay more to interact with people in person awkwardly. 

They should have spent more time on guest mode or allowed multiple family members to logon with their accounts. Most computers, and even the Quest, allow multiple accounts. 

To me, that‚Äôs much more important than the outside OLED. Get others to experience it, don‚Äôt FaceTime with a creepy Persona or talk with weird fake eyes.

2024-02-06,"UI can be the swaying point among many people, and apple manages to do that very well.

Apple Macs became very common for graphic design and video/photo editing among businesses despite much better hardware being available for PCs as well as a much larger library of software. Think of how many people splash out on the latest iPhone just to play shitty mobile games and take photos that they will then slap filters on. There are thousands of these types of people and they are definitely not using the $1000 worth of technology in their device.

VR is still new to the consumer market so the lines between demographics aren't fully defined and Apple seems to be using this to carve out their own demographic as they have with all their other devices."

2024-02-03,We are arguing two different things. You are arguing that the feature is useless. I'm arguing that Apple **thinks** it's necessary.

Well, yeah, it might matter to you. To me personally it is completely irrelevant. Don't take yourself too important because you buy stuff on day 1 - to most of us this means nothing at all and, sorry to be blunt here, for me it just makes you silly. Nothing wrong with that of course."

2024-02-04,Tim Cook is literally one of the premier supply chain experts in the world. Apple makes the scale when they enter a product segment. Every VR headset going forward will benefit from the supply lines being established by Apple.
2024-02-04,"Exactly, there are people who would prefer a better screen over a gaming device with slightly more FOV."
2024-02-05,"I'm talking about ""VR gamers"" specifically, VR as a whole is too broad to group people together.

I can see a lot of businesses using these to present work where the highest quality image is best. Think of an architecture studio being able to present a design by putting their client inside the building."
2024-02-03,"Neither. 

I‚Äôm giving you an example of two products that have similar functions but would be disingenuous to compare since they‚Äôre designed around DIFFERENT philosophies and target audiences."

2024-02-06,"The fact that he owns most of the VR headsets out there, does make him a better than average source of info on the technology in my opinion."
2024-02-04,"Sorry, it was for context because we‚Äôre in an early adoption phase and I believe it gives me a unique perspective on the evolution and flaws of new products. When you‚Äôre an anonymous person online, it‚Äôs so difficult to know if it‚Äôs a first time user or experienced one.

I do see how it came off as bragging, but what I meant was we should be listening to all knowledgeable early adopters for the benefit of the product. Not in a ‚Äúyou must listen to me!‚Äù way but looking for trends in feedback. And it was in response to ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt really matter what you think.‚Äù Companies aren‚Äôt perfect and often their customers, alone or in aggregate, help them make a superior product"

2024-02-06,"That makes no sense because they'd know where the internal components were going, so how could it *ever* be see-through? You think they had all the other parts (cameras, wires, screens, memory, CPUs) in the strap?  Seriously, where did you think they could go?  


The mockup was very clearly a screen."
2024-02-04,But the whole point is that they are comparable on the market. Their potential customer base is a Venn diagram with a lot of overlap

Look at the cost of the Quest Pro and compare that to the Quest 3. Or something like the Tesla Roadster versus the Model 3. I suspect the Vision will find a place around $1,999 if it proves to be a genuine M2/M3 laptop replacement."
