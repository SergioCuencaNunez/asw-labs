2024-03-30,"To answer your phone call while the buds on, touch the bud. If you answer on the phone, it triggers that you want to take the call from the from phone directly"
2024-03-30,If you use an iPhone and have updated to the latest 1.3.26 software. I strongly advise you to disable the bluetooth access to the Bose app and turn it back on when needed or just delete the app all together. Has fixed the annoying audio glitch/stutter issue. Took me 2 warranty replacements within two months to figure this out. The issues begins when updating to 1.3.26. The sound and ANC are paramount why I like these earbuds. Don't care for the mic or other features for my purposes.
2024-03-30,I had AirPods Pro and I liked a lot of the features but the fit and comfort brought me back to these Bose
2024-03-30,"Had the Sony wx1000xm4 for a year and a half, the battery life on them just went down to about 30 minutes per charge, with the batteries being in the case not getting fully charged. Case was showing 70% charge and headphones were at 60% after a full day in the case. 8hrs daily use. These are amazing and so much more comfortable. Both amazing buds, but these work better for me"
2024-03-30,"I own these; I bought them immediately when they first came to market. I agree with your review. NC is best in class. Design and comfort is best in class. MIC sound and background noise on 'calls' is terrible. In my car the background noise and air-conditioner fan noise - I'm being asked to repeat myself all the time, to the point where I'm switching to my Apple Pro 2's that don't seem to have the problem. @Bose should correct this issue with a firmware update, unless it's not possible given the physical design of the mic placement, etc. I did recently speak with @Bose about the issue, and they had me do a hard reset, which according to their tech support person - the call quality was better. But in all fairness I was not in my car or outside to accurately gauge call quality."
2024-03-30,Am I the only one that can't believe we can listen to our headphones wirelessly the way we do now?
2024-03-30,"I just got my set yesterday and I literally can’t take them off! I absolutely love them! The technology in these things are beyond amazing! I love the noise cancellation the best , it is really top shelf. I had a pair of soundsport buds and they didn’t have the noise cancellation. The battery started getting worse and worse until it would only hold 15 minutes of juice. So I figured what the hell id give it a shot and call Bose to see if they could do anything for me (they were 4 yrs old out of warranty) and to my surprise they offered me these ones for $150 + tax. I paid $164 total and free shipping just had to send my old ones back to them in which they provided the label. These are $300 everywhere I’ve looked so I’d say I got a deal. Their customer support is great. I just figured out how to use the equalizer on their app which is really cool. I believe these could be dangerous if you have the noise cancellation on and you’re walking near traffic, you definitely will not hear them. All in all if you are on the fence about getting a set I’d say go for it cuz they are amazing! All the features (I’m still learning) are so cool. Hope this helps someone"
2024-03-30,"These are an improvement over the 1st gen buds. https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxK5mc3yw4xA7Mf2j6k6n1Uqv_KUgrKdeM Pros: The fit is fantastic. This is the biggest plus. They stay in my ears when running and become unnoticeable. They are tight but comfortable. The sound quality is about the same as the 1st gen buds. They pair more easily with my LG G8 ThinQ and immediately reconnect when removed from the case. The sound balance is excellent, good but not overpowering base and clean mid tones and highs.Cons: The noise cancellation is good but perhaps a little less effective than the Bose ANC on the 1st gen buds. Passthrough mode as not as good as the 1st gen buds making it a little more difficult to hear conversations when in passthrough."
2024-03-30,I'm always pounding my chicken.
2024-03-30,"I want wireless earbuds that are high-end, durable, and have good noise canceling and mic quality. I don’t mind paying $300, but I expect a flawless experience. Thanks for your honest review. It helped me avoid these earbuds and look for a better pair."
2024-03-30,"I know you are speaking from your personal experience with the device, but I haven’t experienced any of the issues you are pointing out. I’ve had these Buds since launch and they have worked great in my experience, and I highly recommend them"
2024-03-30,"Thank you for your honest review. Same experience here. Good sound, great noise cancellation. But after 80 days use, I decide to return because of its terrible connection and cutoff issues. Once you have more than two devices with Bluetooth, it will be disconnected! That's super annoying"
2024-03-30,"I have had mine for around the same time. I love them. I have experienced some moments where I have to reconnct them. I am not sure if you covered this, but I have one gripe with them. The fact that you can only use the right one for single use. It would be nice for the price where you can either use left or right as a stand alone. This is standard for other earbuds that are even half the price."
2024-03-30,"Another annoyance I've had with my Android phone is that almost every time I launch the app, I have to manually pair the case to the phone again. Not the buds, just the case. The background noise issue is real; people just can't hear me if i'm in a noisy place. I still love using them while traveling via the airlines."
2024-03-30,"He's downplaying the connection issue, but it truly is a nightmare when the buds won't connect to the phone."
2024-03-30,"I’ve had them for a week and I agree with many of your points already. Insane noise cancelling, the thing about them twisting and needing to readjust as well. My biggest issue with them is that they’ve been a connection nightmare. Along with your issue of them refusing to connect I sometimes only get 1 side to connect and no matter what I do I can’t fix the issue until I put them back in their case and let them sit in there for a while. Going to give them more time but I’ll probably be picking up the Sony WF XM5s that just released on 7/27."
2024-03-30,"I’ve had the Sonys and Bose. I prefer the Bose. Sony didn’t have near enough of the base and the Sonys created an echo when using them on calls. Again, user preference. Bose all the way"
2024-05-04,"I have these, they sound excellent for all types of music, which is what I want headphones for. Don’t care about phone calls, I also haven’t experienced any ‘drop out’ when listening to Spotify when I’m out and about. Connection to all my devices has been better than any other earbud I’ve used. Clarity and bass are exceptional, if you want comfortable earbuds that make music sound great then buy these!"
2024-03-30,"No highs, no lows, must be Bose!"
2024-06-03,So good that you make these long term reviews. The mic test is always a nice way to get a fair review.
2024-07-03,"I love my bose qc 2.. I've owned  Technics and Sony buds and these are far better than any of them I've ever used.. and if you have to adjust your ear buds constantly, then you haven't got the correct fit because when I put mine in they stay in.. They work flawlessly on android.."
2024-03-30,"I had to comment as I used the first qc and regretted buying them for their size…Especially when the qc ii came out.
‘Frustrating’ is a rather extreme adjective to use with these earbuds perhaps, especially if you have not tried the oversized mark i..!
No one does ANC like Bose.They invented the concept. 

Where they fail is in the quality of music sound that pours out of their buds at times…But frustrating it is not, as the EQ or better still, your own personal EQ will resolve that issue. Easy to download a third party version to your phone of some MP3 devices…

I never had audio cut outs nor similar with my earbuds… Perhaps it is the one you’ve got. 

As for ANC and sound quality, you need to have the right wing tips for your ears so they fit tightly.
I watched many reviews and never came across those issues.

I would say that the battery life is its worse feature when compared with other brands which give much more and for the price they cost.

You mention the size of the case! 
Have you seen the first version’s case??? Much bigger that you will enjoy the mark ii version for sure if you know how awful it was.

As for the Sony Mark 5, it will have to improve its ANC to beat Bose’s ANC and aggressive marketing campaign  as they have something which puts them  where they are in this ever changing headset and  gadget market.

If Bose are where they are it is because they do not put all their  eggs in one basket…

So perhaps a smaller case will come, longer battery life for sure  and perhaps even smaller earbuds with optimum sound which does not need tweaking.
Speaking from more than 4 decades of listening to portable / mobile music."
2024-03-30,"Appreciate your review.
The XM5 at Amazon are $349us $429CAD. 
Perhaps at the price differential this makes the Bose QCE2's worth the money."
2024-03-30,"The bose soundsport wireless earbuds, are an older model but they lasted me years, better than the 3 future models"
19  ago,"I love these earbuds I’ve had a pair for years and the right one recently stopped working, I work in a plant and wear these earbuds pretty much 12 hours a day, I need the noise cancellation to be too tied but I will say everything he said about these earbuds are correct, I used the Sonys and they cut my ears constantly, but these are much more comfortable even when I’ve worn them for half a day every day of the week"
2024-03-30,They work flawlessly on Android. Iphones is where most of these problems are coming from. There was an update on the Iphone that fixed many of the issues. With that being said. These earbuds work best on Android. Especially on my S23 Ultra - Galactus
2024-03-30,I use the wired Bose Sound Sport earbuds still to this day. I want to go for wireless but none of them are built with lasting quality and as you mentioned have poor connection problems
2024-03-30,Spot-on review in my experience. One more downside that I am experiencing at the moment is that my right earbud does not work at all anymore. I was thinking is just another connectivity issue so I tried to disconnect the Bluetooth and reconnect from scratch but my case will not go into pairing mode. No matter what I try the flashing blue light does not appear on the case so now I can't even connect my earbuds.
2024-03-30,"Top quality noise cancellation and the sound. Using for 4 months . The only big issue is the charger case. I just dropped once and the top door is broken. There are lot of users reported same. It is a low quality plastic and cannot be glued. If you are not using silicon case , be aware that it will break for sure. Warranty replacement is not covered for that and new charger case is 99$. That is my only complaint."
2024-03-30,"You are pretty spot on with your review. I brought them mainly for the noise anc, which is great but all those other issues drive me nuts."
2024-03-30,Touch controls can be too touchy. They are often activated when I am adjusting the buds in my ears.
2024-11-30,I believe the issues with certain sounds and BOSE'S ANC is a left over from their aviation RND. Certain sounds are still let through because as pilot you want to hear them. But thats just a theory
2024-03-30,"they're a no go for phone calls,  background noise too distracting but i do like these buds. perfect for airplane travel with the noise canceling."
2024-03-30,What I needed to know in 5 seconds. Wow. Thank you.
2024-03-30,"They’re marked down from $430 aud to $300 ($196 usd) wondering if it’s worth it. Also the Sony LinkBuds S are marked down from $350 aud to $195 aud ($127 usd) which is another contender. Beats fit pro also $300 aud down to $230 aud, one that tends to stay in the ear more is a huge plus"
2024-03-30,"First world problem: I hear loud sounds when pounding my chicken. 

Honestly though, great channel and review. Found it useful. Subscribed!"
2024-10-01,While you attend the phone calls in iphone it will not switch automatically to bluetooth earphones with any bluethooth earphones its not a problem with earphone it’s actually iphones setteing u can change it by going to settings accessibility > Touch > Call audio routing and select bluetooth headset
2025-01-29,Finally an honest review channel! I wish you could compare the Jabra Elite 7 vs the Elite 8 Gen 2
2024-11-30,"I have owned two sets of Bose earbuds over the last few years. Although sounds and features are good, after a while the electronic contacts have fallen to bits, usually out of guarantee. Would I recommend them? Possibly not!"
2024-09-01,"Bought ""new"" at walmart. Lasted a few months before i started having troubles. Contacted Bose with the serial number (I learned my new buds were actually refurbished) to get them replaced. Customer service was awesome/Helpful. Hopefully the replacements will last."
2024-03-30,"Video time - 8:40
Unskippable ad time - 12:01

Total video time - 20:41

I'm still not sure what your opinion is"
2024-10-01,"jabra buds are the best in my opinion. Amazing comfort(without needing stability bands), simple design and great audio quality"
2024-03-30,I have bose 700 ad this seems to be a software issue which they have been having for a very long time. I haven't received an update since I have purchased it which is disappointing considering I've had it for  1yr and a half.
2024-03-30,You only need to mention - Those cannot multipoint connect - Although you can remember up to 8 devices - You need to disconnect in between PC and Phone for example. The Sony however has this feature...So for you to know.
2024-03-30,Mine literally just arrived in the post as I'm watching this video... Let's go!!
2024-03-30,"I have these buds and had to send them back for warranty replacement. For some reason, the left bud would not stay aligned to charge in the case. So, I would go to use them to find the right at 100% battery and the Left at 10% or 0%. I followed all their recommendations to resolve the issue and then ended up returning them for a replacement. I am hoping its a one time issue or a manufacturing defect."
2024-03-30,"thank you for this information... I was thinking about getting them bc they're on sale and $199 but now I know the sony's are still better, thank you."
2024-03-30,"I had a pair of the earlier generation of these for two whole days before returning them. They were the ones with the weird rubber hooks. No matter what, they would not stay in my ears. Then again, I'm used to Etymotics ER4's that go DEEP into your ear canals, so these seemed like they were barely hanging in."
2024-03-30,"I have had various earbuds, AirPod Pros Gen 1 and 2 , XM4 etc and so far the XM4 are my favourites. 
The Bose QC II are great and i like the sound quality and the ANC, but the blue tooth connection issue comes and goes. 
If it wasn't for that i would say they were the best I have had."
2024-03-30,"Why should we buy the micron, which turns into so much money, until the call quality becomes bad? If I'm buying an in-ear headset, I expect the microphone and connection to be good. From this perspective, airpods pro 2 meets all needs. Could also be Jabra Elite 10"
2024-03-30,"Had Sony Xm5 Earbuds, huge dissappointment. Changed them to Bose Quiet Comfort Earbuds II . Like the best noise cancellation in the world even without any sound you still get 70% sound cut off. Also ear buds are more comfortable then Sonys"
2024-03-30,6 months later: still pounding
2024-03-30,I've been using it for two months now and it's definitely a headphone to stay away from. There are minor glitches in sound quality. and the connection problem is very annoying. The problem I'm dealing with now is that one of the earphones connects and the other doesn't.
2024-03-30,I have the Galaxy Buds pro 2 and i just love everything about them. No problem at all
2024-03-30,"I'm brazilian and last month I went to NYC on vacation and bought online the ""QuietComfort I"", but the refurbished one (hahaha - our currency is crap). It was USD 144 and as they showed there was international guarantee, I thought it'd worth trying. Well...as soon as I received the package at my hotel, the left earbud wasn't working. A red and white light kept flashing and it didn't conect to my phone. I returned to Brazil and found an official technical assistance. I left my QC I there and they told me they would try to fix it. Well, today I received a call that Bose had sent me a new one. I had a little hope that they could've sent me the QuietComfort II, because the first model had disappeared from Bose's website. To finish the story, they definetely sent me a par of brand new QuietComfort II. I didn't use it yet, but it's definetely working and charging write now! hahaha.
So, I think that although these few negative aspects shown in the video, it was worthy it for USD 144  (just for you guys to have a reference, the QuietComfor II here in Brazil costs aprox the equivalent of USD 620, so definetely it was a good deal). 
PS: if you live abroad and earn in USD or EUR, you NEED to come to Brazil."
2024-03-30,"so for me the only way earbuds are worth it is if they have small enough attachments, these ones regular small were.. okay? I used the regular small for a few months before buying the extra small attachments. Probably turned these earbuds into one of my most enjoyed purchases ever. the extra small is perfect for tiny ears, the stability band is flat and the tips seal is perfect. Despite the weird little quirks I really think these are great when you really want comfort."
2024-03-30,"As a user until now, the Bluetooth connection problem is really a pain.
Especially if you want it to be used between multiple devices.
 Secondly, the case design makes it very hard to clean or check, I currently experiencing that sometimes one of my earbud is not charging, due to the narrow design of the charging case, I won't be able to check the touching point inside or clean it properly."
2024-10-01,"I just picked up a new pair for $118 on eBay sound Amazing. Have senheiser MTW 3, the Bose QC2 fit better ANC got the wireless cover make it all around complete. 
On Bose app there is an automatic call option."
2024-03-30,"That “pounding out chicken” problem is horrible and present in more than just those Bose earbuds. I upgraded from the QC 35 to the QC 45 and any time there’s a loud noise of a certain frequency, it gets piped straight past any noise cancelation and even amplified. Go to your utensil drawer and bang around some of your metal utensils. The metal on metal noise is not suppressed at all by the noise cancelation and is instead amplified! It sounds worse than jarring. It’s a shame to see Bose allowing this problem to exist in what could otherwise be decent products."
2024-10-31,"2:38 Did anyone else think he was about to say ""pounding out chicks"""
2024-03-30,"I just can not wear the XM4’s for a long time. After playing with the EQ for the Bose, the QC’s are the ones to go with right now."
2024-03-30,The part which annoys me is it doesn’t have the quick pairing switch feature like the Boss QC/700 headset series
2025-02-28,"Best  ANC. Great transparency. Then problems galore.

Gave up on Bose earbuds. I am now trying to find the next best ANC earbuds."
2024-03-30,Thanks for the review. Just saw these in a local retail store at sale for the equivalent of 163 USD in my currency.
2024-03-30,"I have to use in-the-ear hearing aids on a normal basis. Obviously, sound quality is less of an issue for me because I can't tell the difference.  I am looking at purchasing these earbuds strictly for use on an airplane, to cancel airplane noise and listen to videos (instead of using my hearing aids).  I have excellent noise cancelling headphones, but they are bulky.  Would it be worth it to purchase these, and would I have to get an adapter to use them with the plane's system?"
2024-03-30,"""When the mallet hits the chicken""? Now that is not a phrase I expected to hear in an earbuds review!"
2024-09-01,"I hate to say this but it feels like one needs two pairs. The Bose feel best if you travel alot because the noise cancellation is great. The air pod pros just have more features and a better warranty, not having to search for a misplaced case and seamless switching between other Apple device is nice, but the lack of EQ without going into the accessibility is pretty lame at this price point.  The Sony WF-1000XM4 are great, but I have one bud that won't charge beyond 15% and no good way to repair it."
2024-03-30,"If you're into being frustrated then I would recommend getting these earbuds.  When they work, they're ok.  One small issue is that I can't turn off the active hear-through option even though it's turned off in the app.  The bigger issue is it's inability to connect to my iPhone 13 Pro Max.  It connects when it wants to and doesn't when it doesn't.  I've done every troubleshooting option possible. Reinstalled the app twenty times.  Reynced my phone at least that many times.  Finally I tossed it against a wall then thrashed it cause I can afford to.  Bose engineers are worthless."
2024-03-30,"noise cancelling was the main feature i am looking for. i tested the apple pro 2 and they were pretty good but i returned them to try these bose. im only on day 2 of trying them out, and i feel like the noise cancelling is better than apples - but now trying to decide if its enough better to stick with bose when my other products are apple. also if the cost difference is worth it. right now apple pro 2 are on sale for $199 and i paid $249 for the bose quiet ii"
2024-08-02,Also the volume in calls is so low that is hard to hear the other end . Bose asking 300€ + for the earbuds that can’t work for edc .
2024-03-30,"Thanks for the review! I've had some bose soundsport in-ear (wired) that I loved for the past 3 years and they recently died, so I have a discount for the new Quiet comfort ii. 

So my random question: In total I'd pay around 160 USD for the QC ii, I wouldn't use them for calls, mainly to listen to music so I don't mind about the mic quality. $160 is also the same price I can find the pixel buds pro where I live,

What would you prefer between the two (pixel or Bose) considering they are the same price in my situation?"
2024-03-30,"Man oh man, the refusing to connect to the phone after multiple attempts and even restarting it is why I now have a broken case that is taped to close, it’s infuriating and happens commonly"
2024-03-30,"Even my AirPods Pro’s refuse to connect to my phone sometimes too. I think that’s just Bluetooth devices in general. Although they’ve been better here lately. 

Just bought the Bose, though, because my AirPods have had consistent issues. The right earbud makes weird sounds and feels more like an ear plug in transparency mode, despite being able to hear like it’s transparent. Got this fixed once, and now it’s back. Right outside of warranty. 

So I’m done with Apple’s crap. Time to switch back to bose.

(Lol right as I made this comment my AirPods didn’t want to connect)"
2024-08-02,"completely off topic, but which microphone are you using for your videos? Your sound is so clear and crisp"
2024-03-30,"I purchased mine solely for use in my workshop as hearing protection - they are truly the best at noise cancelling and I love them. I have only one feature that is really anoying - when starting a phone call, the buds plays a sound over the greeting from the other end - I often find it difficult to know if the other person answered. I have not been able to find a setting for turning this off - do you if this is possible and in that case how?"
2024-03-30,"I own series I and II Bose QC earbuds. I am a Bose person. I also own Bose Acoustimass loudspeakers 3,  5 and 6.1."
2024-09-01,"Thanks, as a serial killer I found this really useful."
2024-03-30,"I've had two pairs and they are both crippled by the latest updates which came out earlier in the year. Sync issues, turning themselves off and disconnecting from devices. Most of the time they're ok, however it should be all the time. Also I simply cannot use the with Google TV. They disconnect within 10 minutes and I have to put them back in the case and pull them back out again which isn't acceptable. Unfortunately this experience is making think twice before buying a Bose product again."
2024-03-30,"I own the Bose QC Ultra earbuds and I strongly recommend that you update BOTH the buds and the charging case. That will fix many of your connection problems. 

The lack of multipoint connection is very irritating.  In my case,  it is the most irritating flaw on the earbuds. 

The controls on these earbuds are better than any other earbuds I have used by far.  It's not even close. 

The fit and comfort of these earbuds are the best I have ever worn by far.  It's not even close. 

The sound quality is spectacular.  I'm not sure if there's a big difference between the QC II and QC II Ultra earbuds,  but the Ultra sound is stunning. 

The Sony XM5  earbuds require four taps to change volume,  which is the most used control on any set of earbuds.  That is just absurdly stupid!  I don't see how you don't understand that. That defect alone would stop me from buying the Sony earbuds. 

Most of the time, my single point connection with the QC II Ultras works flawlessly. But lack of multipoint connection irritates the hell out of me.

The ANC is simply the best, especially for irritating low range noises which are as common as dirt. They also do superb job of blocking out cafe and workplace voice noise,  even loud noises. 

I play basketball with them on and rarely have to adjust them.  They are great workout earbuds. 

I got the QC II Ultra earbuds on sale for $250.00 and I am keeping them.  The comfortable fit, the amazing audio quality and ANC,  the great control system, all of these qualities make them the best overall earbuds available."
2024-03-30,"The one thing, nobody showed up in review is the huge level of white noise. For me was deal breaker. Returned the set for next day. 300€ for noise that drilling a brain"
2024-03-30,"The Bose ANC products are named Quiet Comfort. That's what they promise and that's what they deliver. Best in Comfort, Best in bringing Quietness. That's what you pay for, not for the bells and whistles of the competitors."
2024-03-30,"I stopped using the Bose app altogether for connectivity. I have no idea why it’s so poor, but once i stopped using that app, i get no glitches."
2024-03-30,"Apparently these are Tom Hank’s favourites, he wears them when he’s choking his chicken."
2024-03-30,"I don't mind most of the downsides. The needing to reconnect through bluetooth every once in awhile is annoying, but what really kills it for me is the call quality. These earbuds pick up a lot of ambient noise and there is a feedback loop/echo effect that happens. It sounds like Norman Bates getting ready to stab someone in Psycho. Absolutely infuriating and makes these ear buds feel about $75 - 100 off the mark of where their price point should really be."
2024-10-31,Thank you for pointing out the noise cancelling failures. I almost lost my hearing using them while weed whacking. What a joke these buds are
2024-03-30,I just go them but for me they are working perfectly so far Indo t have any issue like you are having in your video.
2024-03-30,Which earbuds would you say are the best that you have reviewed so far ?
2024-03-30,I have the Bose NC 700 headphones and I encounter all the same problems that you mentioned regarding connecting it to an iPhone on a daily basis.
2024-05-04,The only reason I kept them is; because the tip the silicon tip comes out and I can fit the old-fashioned round or funnel shape ear tip! The same thing with the AirPods I hate the oval sub silicon. I had to re-sign and remake with crazy glue so I can fit my AirPods better into my ear but that click irritate for Apple. It was a huge mistake.
2025-01-29,I had to return these for one reason only; when taking phone calls the other line COULD NOT hear me without ambient noise completely mixing with my voice
2024-03-30,You think the issues are cause you have an iphone? Cause apple is very special with what youre connecting it to. I just got the Z Fold 5 and i have airpods pro 2 but all the features ive lost on them sucks so i want to switch to other buds
2024-03-30,"I just bought mine and was surprised that they dont allow multiple pairing of phones. While you can pair to 6 multiple devices Just are only able to pair to one phone at a time, unlike some other products that can pair with  more than one phone at a time"
2024-03-30,What are the loudest earbuds out there now? The one now are really now that loud and you have to turn them up to the max level sometimes??!!
2024-03-30,"Thanks for your review! Question: can I use ANC while wearing only one bud? When I sleep, I only put the earbud in the ear that's not on the pillow, and I need ANC."
2024-03-30,"I always love Bose speakers especially the fact that's made by MIT. However, Bose Quiet comfort's  sound quality  can only b good for a week or 1st month cause it will fall off ur ears onto the hard floor, thus its sound quality is destroyed. 
 :(
Hopefully the Comfort II fits better."
2024-03-30,Thanks for information.
2024-03-30,"There is an interesting pair of earbuds I think would be fun to review. The Poly Voyager Free 60+ UC, while pricey, offers some unique design choices."
2024-03-30,"Hi,
which ones are better in terms of Bass, which ones are more bass heavy?? The originals or II Gen?"
2024-03-30,"Jabra makes Excellent ear buds, unfortunately they don’t have wing tips and fall out of my big ass ears, wound up getting the Jaybird Vista and I couldn’t be happier."
2024-03-30,"Currently, these are $199 which is only $10 more than the Apple Airbuds Pro. I chose these over the Apples because I would bet lots of money that the sound quality is better. Furthermore, my last Apple Airbuds lasted a whole 2 yrs. of occasional use. That simple is unacceptable for anything costing more than $100."
2024-03-30,"Massively temperamental / unpredictable. Used to function fine. Now sometimes won't charge until after special random fiddly treatment, just now they're absolutely unwilling to connect to the device I've been using them with for months, the reason I ended up here was that the left one had inexplicably gone silent... tbh, I hate it."
2024-03-30,Will you  do an overview on the A&K AK UW100MKII coming out soon?
2024-03-30,Protip I own them disable transparency with one earbuds if you have problems with the ANC. The connection issues are so annoying mine have been worse than his it's only like every month but I'd probably stick with apple the next time I buy earbuds.
2024-03-30,Thanks for the info!
2024-05-04,Then after about a month I would need to manually connect the buds every time. They would connect to my phone when they were still in the case… one bud would stop charging. Lots and lots of issues with these…
2024-03-30,"I have a love hate relationship with my Bose QC2, I moved to Bose after some years on AirPod. Frustrating is an understatement; connecting the QC is so annoying, keeps going on and off. I would trade in an heartbeat the superior sound quality of QC2 for the bulletproof seamless apple AirPod connectivity.

The built quality on the QC2 are not even close to the Apple AirPods especially the case."
2024-03-30,"I had to send mine back because no matter what I did they wouldn't connect to audio, only calls. Super annoying cause I use them for mostly audio. Bose is sending me the bose earbuds quietcomfort 2. For free so we will see how it goes."
2024-03-30,How do you think the noise cancellation works on an airplane and having to deal with noisy kids? Major pet peeve I have. I can't stand being on an airplane and listening screams and kids whining.  Esp a long flight.
2024-06-03,"I bought these quite a while ago, but never opened the package until about a month ago.  
I'm so disappointed, because like this review says, the noise cancelling and comfort were SOOO good.  
But the connection problems to my macbook with these earbuds was horrible.  I had to constantly disconnect and reconnect them.  
I also had to remove them from my mac's memory, then reinstall them quite a few times. 
Then I had to start doing a factory reset on them to get them to work. 
And now, the case just completely is dead. 
Won't charge, won't reset.  
I've tried all of the suggested trouble shooting and now I'm just stuck with a dead set of very expensive earbuds.
That's what I get for keeping a product for a long time without opening the package and it's too late to return. 
I hope this helped someone else who is watching reviews on this product, don't buy!"
2024-10-31,"I came here to know the bad side. 
There are so many Utube comments about this good product. 
NO need to know good things go to strait to bad one."
2024-03-30,"Hi, what brand is the charging cable ? 7.09 Is it original Bose ? Thanks ! Glenn"
2024-03-30,"Would you sleep in these?  I'm looking for noise cancelling ear buds, but can't find any."
2024-03-30,"You may have a lemon head set , I have the same, and no issues"
2024-03-30,Excellent review.
2024-11-30,With time the connectivity drops and drops that you have to do factory reset every few months or week
2024-03-30,What is the best earbud for lovers of loud music ?
2025-01-29,"Just returned mine because i went through everything you explained, ima  go back to apple pros"
2024-03-30,I'm getting one day it's worth your money
2024-03-30,"I really liked the buds, but I returned them because the app is pure garbage. It constantly disconnects from the buds, and you can't even update the case through the app."
2024-03-30,These are the Ones which do have best quality
2024-03-30,"I have both the QCI and QCII earbuds.  Basically hate the QCIIs.  Cannot get a comfortable fit as I have to adjust them constantly.  moreover, I don't notice major ANC nor do they even sound as good as the QCIs.  Don't care about the wireless connectivity but I have noticed they will cut in and out while I'm wearing them.  All in all, I think the QCIIs suck."
2024-03-30,How are they compared to the AirPod pro 2s?
2024-10-31,thanks man.. great advice.
2024-03-30,"""bass was a bit much"" SOLD"
2024-03-30,"You are right wit the chicken thing, I am here because when I close my car door I can hear it in the headphones"
2024-03-30,"I have the Bose sport, does worth to upgrade?"
2024-08-02,These are under 80$ in my country so are they worth it for that price?
2024-06-03,It just needs to be connected to the charger during pairing. Even if the case is at full battery
2024-09-01,I use the Sony's but if I don't cram them deep into my brain they fall out so easily. I've tried every sizer that they offer in the box but they just aren't stable for me.
2024-03-30,Even the first generation quiet comfort buds have the same issues.
2024-03-30,"Honestly, I've heard of ""choking the chicken,"" but if you're ""pounding the chicken,"" we'll . . . have at it."
2024-03-30,"When on phone calls, the other person cannot hear you with any background noise on your end. Ex: when I'm waling on the street, they say the cars passing by sound like high pitched rushing water and they can't hear me. I told Bose this and they sent me a new paid, but I have the same problem with the new pair."
2024-03-30,"I use Bose QC II. I bought this to canceling noise while I'm traveling in airplane, but it is very easy to drop. I almost lost it in airplane. I worry about wearing it on airplane again."
2024-03-30,When running they pop and knock. Is that normal or are the drivers loose. Has done it from new. The wired qc buds i used before were ok for a long time before they started to knock. Im guessing not well positioned drivers and the running thuds from the feet affect the sound. Hmmm. Anybody ?
2024-03-30,The Bose sounds better and has the type of bass that I like..I was disappointed with the Sony's and returned them bcuz they lacked the bass I wanted
2024-03-30,I wish you had compared it to the older model. Other than that great video
2024-03-30,"Id just like to add I love mine but they a purpose built earbud, i dont use them for daily life and walking and talking. They live on my work desk or come with me while traveling on a plane. They do have the quirks that i wear my Airpods for in daily life that work more seamlessly.  I honestly would NOT want to wear the QC2's for daily life.... The noise cancellation is TOOOO good lol.  They are great if you want a ""stationary"" pair of earbuds with comfort and noise cancellation that cant be beat in a earbud.    

I disagree with this review slightly as he is comparing Headphones to Earbuds in some comparisons which is apples to oranges and not fair."
2024-03-30,I bought these and I found that they always feel like there are falling out I ordered the extra sizes and still don’t feel secure
2024-05-04,"Exactly same issues and same comments after 3 month using daily my bose
I would like to add some annoying part during my daily routine with my Bose - seems that Bose have really an issue to manage Bluetooth technology .. on my previous earbud , on my new earbud on my Bose speaker … then comes to basics , not even technology , the bud case !! The previous Bose quiet comfor was not even magnetic and need to clip , so after intense usage the pc of plastic will break , I have changed it twice on that time , now new generation Bose quiet comfor comes with magnetic style , finally .. but the magnet is not strong enough , when you walk , the case will have the tendency to open itself , be careful! Then the last one , the Bose silicon case to protect , cannot even for properly the case and it’s not cheap .. and those basic stuff cannot be fixed before .. what the RND team is doing ? The first generation was a joke , now much more expensive still have this kind of issues , when Bose could have with the same sounds quality take out all those inconvenience.. just check all the apple bud and copy them .. 10 years I have been using apple and never had such issues , I wanted to change for better quality of sounds system with Bose .. at this price all must be perfect in my opinion !"
2024-03-30,"Let's TALK beef... Ipaired them with iPHONE SE. The sound is great. BUT.... I cannot manage my songs.
1- Other earbuds allow me to visually identify which song is playing on my music list (either with a distinctive color or an equalizer image). Not these.
2- I am unable to change songs using the list on my iPhone. The earbuds keep on playing their song.
I followed the instructions to pair them, but I could not find a solution to my problem.
Should I return them? It's only about a week since I have them.
Any ideas?
Thanks!"
2024-03-30,"I love Bose, but I’m not spending a dollar on their ear buds until they’ve been bought by Apple, or implement apples notification announcements like the air pods pro, that’s huge for me, to be busy and have a text spoken to you As it comes in. Flawless"
2024-03-30,i got the Sony WF-1000XM4 off ebay for like 60 bucks used. just gonna replace the tips and use my own usb c cable
2024-09-01,"That ""clipping"" noise is also present on my air pods pro 2."
2024-03-30,I am so glad that I don’t have have any of those issues.
2024-06-03,Older version of bose earbuds are not working on my iphone. Is apple making the bluetooth obsolete?
2024-03-30,"....great performance and noise cancelling (i use them on long flights with no audio input), however the ergonomics are AWFUL.  if i'm in motion, they simply won't stay in my ears.  i use these when stationary and my $100 sony's for walking and other exercise.  phone calls are hit or miss as well, maybe because they're not in the apple ecosystem, but i often have to shut off bluetooth in order to receive a phone call."
2024-03-30,"Spot on review. I got a pair of these headphones pretty much day 1, and have experienced ALL your issues.

Audio drop outs are random, and annoying. Sometimes won't get any, sometimes its so frequent as to become frustrating.  The having to select the buds manually each time someone calls you thing is such an annoyance!

However, main issue i've found is they seem to just fail over time. I'm about to send my SECOND pair back under warranty today (and this is how i found this vid, googling for issues on these ear buds).

My first pair, a few months in, just started playing up randomly. Only one ear bud would connect. Another time, they'd refuse to connect at all, and only way to solve to remove pairing and repair. And often the re-pairing would fail. These random faults became an almost daily occuracne and got so fed up, i sent back under warranty, and to be fair did get sent a new pair.

I've had replacement pair 3 or so months now, and the last 3 days, these random failings are starting again. Exactly the same issues as the first pair. Mega frustrating, and going back under warranty again.

Its such a pity, cos when these earbuds are working, they really are magnificent, best sounding and best noise cancelling i've ever heard... but the frustrations are starting to out-weigh the positives."
2024-03-30,"they sound really low quality to me for some reason. i cant change the settings on macbook
edit: i restarted my macbook and they sound good now :D"
2024-07-03,I wish you could find these earphone locations or have them make a sound when you cant find them around
2024-06-03,Maybe it’s a safety thing for not blocking everything with ANC?
2024-03-30,Would they work well around heavy equipment and cutting grass with the noise canceling
2024-03-30,"I think they’re crap. Bose is USING apples model of industrial ‘obsolescence’. 

Each model, and there are loads, changes the case. And charger so if you lose and earbud, you have to buy a new set of a new model. The biggest risk is not malfunction, but loss. 

This new II is a pain. The touch sensitive is over the top so if you brush them incidentally or put you head on a pillow, whatever yr listening to jumps ahead to the next show/song, video or podcast. It’s total jerk around. 

The rubber bits are flimsy and easily come off. 

Most buds have good sound these days so best save yr $$ and buy a cheaper version in another brand. 

Last ever purchase from Bose. (Bloody Overpaid Sales Engineers). 

The noise cancellation is the same. The earlier version was better. This is a backwards step and for over $400 it’s a joke.  The software interface is clunky to set up and I still can’t load it to adjust the sound."
2024-03-30,"I picked up this one because I didn't want to use Apple products. My current airpods were annoying with one of the pairs constantly being out of charge. I don't understand how the trillion-dollar company cannot see the flaws in their case design - it is just a mini dust collector that works like a powerful Dyson machine, or they intentionally designed it so that it helps them to sell the new pieces sooner.
 ( Ps: While cleaning my AirPods case the charging wire at the bottom, inside the case got hooked on the cotton bud and came out)"
2024-03-30,These Bose buds cannot be replaced if lost like Apple and need to buy another $300 set as lost buds is out of warranty…should put that in your video. Owned for 1 week and no support given from Bose besides buy another one
2024-03-30,"Sorry, but on iPhones, if you answer using the phone, the call will be on the phone. No matter what headset you use. It's an annoying Apple thing."
2024-03-30,"How are the qc2 for gym workout?
Are they pressuring on your ears canals?"
2024-03-30,they are amazing no complains so far
2024-03-30,"I had them for about 3 days, i loved the ANC, best ive ever experienced, but, they were the absolute worst sound devices ive ever heard, nothing but bass bloat that drowns out the entire frequency and the worst detail retrieval ive ever heard"
2024-03-30,Ive owned mine for about a mont and had had big connection issues.  Weirdly its most often when I try to connect to Audible.  They just wont connect when I play that app.
2024-03-30,i've replaced my earbuds 2 times due to left earbud low audio everytime i wear them for a few months.
2024-07-03,"Thank you, this video is very informative and helps a lot! I got distracted a lot by your beautiful eyes tho ."
2024-03-30,"Just got em.third day and right one makes a noise of like a bug crawling inside it even without audio,do not know what to do"
2024-03-30,"Excellent review 

I won't go for Bose. They're Not my baby"
2024-03-30,I bought one is 10 times better than my iPod pro
2024-05-04,"iphone is working quite bad with NOT apple buds. yeah, it's mostly apple fault"
2024-03-30,"these are 200 with a 2 year warranty
that's cheaper than the beats studio plus"
2024-03-30,These ear buds suck… you can’t even wear a beanie over them because they start freaking out and start doing this one annoying noise telling you that they are submerged
2024-08-02,The call quality is terrible
2024-03-30,Somebody know if the volume could be adjusted independently in either of the earbuds (right and left)?
2024-03-30,These have been a total disaster. Thousands of bad reviews. Mine are borderline unusable because they constantly bug out. Working on a review myself because I feel taken for a $300 ride. My wife Airpod pros dont sound as good but they have literally never disconnected and were $100 cheaper.
2024-07-03,Are these bose ear buds wireless charging?
2024-03-30,"Wind noise cancellation is not present... When I walk through the street, I can hear tornado. For bicycle or something that moving faster then  worm can't be used. Bose"
2024-03-30,For the price the battery life should be way better
2024-03-30,I haven’t seen a pair of headphones that don’t move or that completely block out every thing
2024-03-30,Mine were great for about a month…Now nothing but issues one earbud is alway’s not working…
7  ago,"you clearly haven't experienced a big downside with these..it's along the lines of your chicken chop story..slam a tight german car door and you'll hear a sonic boom in your ear drum..at times this has been very dangerous other times not so much..also wind noise when driving can be dangerous too if you have them on loud..the rest of the connection and dropout stuff you said is pretty accurate!

sound quality is 8/10
firmware us 6/10
case 6/10
phone calls 7/10
bass 8/10
treble 8/10

for certain environments these are top 3 right now, but everyday wear these are not that good."
2024-03-30,"""iphone not switching automatically during phone calls"", happens with my airpods also. iPhone's problem."
2024-08-02,Man these buds are amazing ive had numerous $300-$400 earbuds don't xm3 and xm4 jabra elite 7's and a couple more jabras those wher my favorite some mater and dunamic mw8's that where retaded expensiv airpods pro  beats power beats pro and skull cand  indy anc that are my favorite or if what ive listed but are consequently in the cheapest ive had several more and so far the Bose qc 2 are the only ones that stay in my ears no matter what actualy IN MY Ear and they sound the best by FAR and ANC is beyond amazing  border line magical is incredible they remind me kinda of in ear beyerdynamic DT1770's witch is saying allot about there sound they are incredible
2024-03-30,What are do you doing to the chicken ??
2024-03-30,"better than airpods they don't work, they get dirty and the box gets stained, the best black color"
2024-03-30,I love these buds but one thing that pounds my chicken is when I wear a hat they sometimes active the controls .. does anyone know if you can lock the controls
2024-10-01,Unfortunately phone calls quality is very poor.. but ANC is great
2024-03-30,Friend of mine bought me these for my birthday. I cut grass for a living. Had some 20 dollar walmart specials until now. Turned them on today and Bluetooth to my phone and was ready to go. Never had a noise cancelation b4 on my old ones so i was wondering how in the hell everything i was hearing for a few seconds was totally gone. Unreal.. Just watched this video and was like ahhh i see lol. When i use the weedeater tho i did get a like click sound every now and then. About to download the app and see what all these actually do. Day 1 for me using them i give em a 9 out of 10. Like i said tho i did have 20 dollar walmart specials
2024-03-30,Basic feature @bose failed to give is a clear audio call..try asking other side how they hear your sound on call.They will say they only hear background noise..crap product. Bose has become lowgrade..
2024-03-30,Worst earbuds in market. The first thing it should do it get connected. I have to spend 2-3 minutes to get it connected most of thr times. Putting the earbuds  back on box and then again using it
2024-03-30,"For everyone's sake, just call them the ""xm4's"".  Your video would have been 2min shorter . Nice review though"
2024-03-30,"I got these and I’m so disappointed…
Why is the sound so low???"
2024-03-30,Idk if anyone else has this problem but my pair connect to my phone no problem but when I try to adjust things in the Bose app it won't say connected. And when I try to hit connect it says error try again
2024-12-30,Aren't these the Ultras?
2024-10-01,"The same downsides that I’ve with nothing ear, first gen!!!!"
2024-03-30,"i have airpods 3 and beats pro and don`t feel that beats has ANC, but according to tests - beats = airpods pro 2...."
2024-03-30,"So got them Christmas Day. Today they 3m 2d old. They are over all junk. Sound, cancellation, and talk on the phone are great. Every thing else is shit. The quality of the case the, little rubber earpiece that constantly spins, they want disconnect, the charging cord will not stay in the port. The C connector is approximately about a quarter inch long. Only about half of that actually goes into the earbud case to charge to start with. The case top is flimsy. 
Was not connecting so I deleted and now can’t be located to reconnect."
2024-03-30,"The Volume sucks they sound like they are on a 4 on volume control they are not that great at all, I have Bose headphones and those are Awesome my phone keeps telling me to turn them down"
2024-03-30,Only Apple products reliably pair with Apple products.  They engineer it that way.
2024-03-30,Yes you are true.. Even i face the same issues
2024-03-30,Just got these i really like them. And it really depends on what phone you have. I personally think it works great with samsung
2024-03-30,I love these. Upgraded to them after my AirPods Pro failed less than 2 years into owning.
2024-03-30,2yrs later. Still going strong  music
2024-03-30,BOSE COMFORT 2
2024-03-30,"I am so disappointed with the software and connectivity, how can a company as large as Bose be so bad with these two fundamental functions. Google manage to get everything correct apart from they don't fit and they hurt your ears after 1hr, plus the battery life is awful. If I could smash the QC II and the Pixel Bud Pro II software n multipoint functions together, they'd be the perfect. There are no other buds that are as comfortable as these, but wow they suck in many other areas."
2024-03-30,I just want buttons on earbuds I get so many erroneous skip forwards.
2024-03-30,Aptx when?
2024-03-30,I thought the google pixel pros sounded the best.
2024-03-30,"Hi, can we connect earbuds to pc?"
3  ago,I will never waste 200 dollars on this product anymore not worth it I get so many complaints while on phone call
2024-07-03,I like them
2024-03-30,Whats the button for on charging pod
2024-07-03,"I hate these earbuds so much, they get me so damn angry. Dont get me wrong, they sound way better than Beats. But the bluetooth connectivity is garbage. Especially if you only hook up one earbud, it’ll keep disconnecting and you gotta keep resetting the device. A $30 earbud has much more stable bluetooth connectivity.."
2024-10-31,You should have gotten firmwere updates.
2024-03-30,I love my Bose
2024-05-04,can only this video be picture in picture??
2024-05-04,Canceled the order. Thanks.  224$
2024-03-30,Galaxy buds pro 2 sounds good on mic
2024-06-03,Unfortunately doesn't worth it l use this device around 1 year and sound quality it's not good now .
2024-03-30,These seem like Aliexpress Bose branded buds.
2024-11-30,"""Pounding out chicken"" sure buddy"
2024-10-31,Pounding your chicken? I don’t wanna know
2024-07-03,"DO NOT PURCHASE THESE!!! Noise cancellation on these earbuds are immaculate, but these earbuds are absolute trash. I’ve gone through three different sets of the ultra earbuds in the last 2months, and after about 10 days I have static interference in the right ear. Happened every time... there are a plethora of videos on YouTube as well as Reddit conversations letting you know that this is not worth wasting your money."
2024-03-30,Are those suited for side sleepers?
2024-03-30,The mics sounded all the same in every example
2024-03-30,Sennheiser momentum 3??
2024-08-02,Completely disagree. I find the Bose sound quality superior to Sony. You're other problems I've never experienced.
2024-08-02,"Sound - great…noise cancelling- great…fit- meh, not as good as the first generation ….battery life and convenience of not having a chargeable case - sucks ass."
2024-03-30,What did the chicken do?
2024-03-30,Google pixel buds n Samsung buds are best
2024-03-30,This needs more visibility. You wont readily see this problem on store page reviews.
2024-08-02,Horrible product. The bluetooth part is totally unreliable. It constantly disconnects and often I have to do the pairing from scratch. The audio part with the noise cancellation is great. But the connectivity part exposes poor quality. The sound sport didn't have these problems.
2024-03-30,Lol can't cut out chicken pounding
2024-10-01,Pounding your chicken
2024-03-30,"im a professional chicken pounder, i guess this is not for me:("
2024-03-30,I have bought the Buds and they are horrible.They keep falling out of my ears and none of the sizes fit me. MyJABRA ELITE 75t are still better than these BOSE Buds. I brewed a pair that of buds that work my iPads...
2024-03-30,So you are a chef pounding chicken
2024-03-30,Controls suck! Stactic is a problem ! Connection sucks .. I want my money back and charge dies after a while . BOSE I want my money Back
2024-03-30,never happened for me
2024-11-30,DO NOT BUY THESE. the sw is total trash. Constantly disconnects at random times. Then refuses to reconnect been going on for months. The support just told me to rest the whole headphone. Like it happens weekly!!!
2024-03-30,Galaxy Buds Pro sounds best.
2024-03-30,The lett sode it doesnt work not good eexpensive and not whorth at all
2024-03-30,Bose music app is very unreliable too.
2024-10-31,"So… don’t buy these because when beating a chicken breast with a mallet, they don’t work well."
2024-03-30,I sent mine back for a refund
2024-10-01,Good but not worth $300
2024-08-02,"wtf is ""pounding out chicken""?  lmao..."
2024-10-31,Wow. A lot of annoying downsides. Not buying these now.
2024-03-30,Lost me at pounding chicken
2024-03-30,Don't buy it. I think those are one of the worst bose product....
2024-03-30,"NOT Worth it, waste of Money"
2024-09-01,mine lasted 4 month. Pfft!
2024-03-30,worst product I've EVER bought
2024-10-01,BUY SONY THATS IT....
2024-03-30,Jabra iş the best
2024-03-30,Ew that mic quality
