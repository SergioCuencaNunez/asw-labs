2024-01-31,For lazy people. Airpods Pro 2 is the best for Apple users and Sony WF-1000XM5 is the best for Android and other devices users.
2024-01-31,"my original airpod pros didn‚Äôt have any better connectivity than my wf1000xm5, i use an iphone and an ipad and the handoff almost never worked. since that was the main reason of using the airpods i just switched instead of upgrading."
2024-01-31,"My problem with the hand off is that it always happens when I don't want it to but not always when I do. Apple stuff tries TOO hard to integrate sometimes. On the same note, no I do not want my phone to be my microphone just because my laptop, which has a perfectly adequate microphone, is recording. Not everything needs to connect every time it can"
2024-10-03,"Same sentiments! It was time to upgrade because the battery life is too short for me now. I gave my AirPods Pro 1 to my dad and ordered a WF-XM5. Integration on my XM4 headphones feel so seamless and I hope it'll be just as good with the WF-XM5s.

Ironic how the ""handoff"" feature of the AirPods isn't as useful as it's made out to be, given its crappy battery life. Also hated how it did not have a low battery warning feature. It just... died."
2024-10-03,"I'd love the handoff if it had a reliable confirmation, and/or if I could set which devices hand off."
2025-01-20,"You can! You go into Bluetooth settings, select the AirPods information tab, and then at the top it was saying connect to this ‚Äòdevice‚Äô and you can set it to either, automatically or if it‚Äôs what was last used. Hope this helps, same with the Mac and iPhone microphone, it‚Äôs all just going through your settings and customising what you want integrated and not, Apple are good at giving you the option nowadays."
2024-02-01,"I use an iPhone and I would not trade my XM5 for anything else. The sound quality is simply superior to everything on the market, even on AAC."
2024-04-11,any battery drain issues on XM5? i have the xm4 but they're failing me now and wondering if i should go for airpods for convenience but i love the sound and noise cancelling on the sony products
2024-04-14,"None at all. I honestly suspect it has to do with which country you buy it from, but I have no evidence. But the thing is if it drains during warranty, you could always get Sony to replace it. If it drains after warranty, well given the pace of earbud technology development, you might as well find new and better buds by then."
2024-09-07,Just get you the XM5. They‚Äôre worth it. Find a local place that fixes electronics. Get your batteries replaced.
2024-09-14,"1st time on here - switched from Android to Apple devices and had the XM4s switched to the 5s love them, use them a lot brilliant for travelling, the Air Pods pro 2 are good for what they are and have great features as they're no match on the XM5s in my humble opinion.¬†

Also I would say the Airpod pro 2 are better than the Airpods 4 N/C addition, simply because of the Hearing Care.¬†

Enjoy whatever you decide."
2025-02-28,Too bad iphone doesn't have ldac

2024-11-06,"I use my Airpods Pro 2 with my Samsung Flip 5, and I like them better than the Sony XM4 which I owned perviously. The Airpods are much more intuitive, in my opinion. I don't have the XM5, but in terms of comfortability, I forget my Airpods are in sometimes, and the XM4 would hurt my ears after serveral hours of use."
2024-09-07,"I‚Äôm Apple eco, but I love my Sony! Sony XM4 and XM5 are unmatched. You can‚Äôt change my mind."
2024-01-31,"Agreed, I had the mx4 and was affected by the sonny update that killed the battery. I bought mx5 cuz I loved the feature that it has with my pixel phone"
2024-04-11,does xm5 have any battery drain issues? I'm highly debating between the airpod pros 2 over XM5 this time despite being a fan of sony headphones/earbuds
2025-03-14,"I second this. This is a struggle, and I‚Äôm on a loose thread from not buying the XM5s because of the poor battery life for their earbuds. 
I have the WH-1000XM5 and they‚Äôre amazing! Both sound quality and battery life, I had it in 2022 by the end of the year and so far no problems with the battery life. Only had to get it fixed with the right side having no sound after 6 months of use.
I want to get the xm5 for it‚Äôs superior sound quality to any product in the market and lately, and the only thing I‚Äôve noticed is on par is the Airpods Pro 2, with the only downside of not having a customizable EQ (which really is a turnoff since I‚Äôm really into sound quality)"
2025-03-14,"I had the wf-xm5 but lost the case and the sound in of the ears disappeared and I couldn't get a warranty replacement because I didn't have the original case.

Went with airpods pro 2 because of convenience and ease to use with the iPhone. plus I feel like the airpods are much more comfortable because it's smaller and less likely to fall out of the ear."
2024-01-31,"Have the same situation last week.
I have apple ecosystem (use ip13 pro, ipad, macbook air) buat also use windows laptop for work.

I‚Äôd like to use this on my laptop too. So finally i choose xm5. Especially since i got them for less than $250."
2024-02-01,mind sharing how you got xm5 for &lt; 250 ?
2024-02-01,I am not in the US but I know Best Buy sometimes has a deal on them. I got mine outside of the US for the equivalent of 230$ which I think is a fair price. Anything more than 250$ is not a good price imo as it would mean they are more expensive than the APP2
2024-02-01,"I‚Äôm also not in us, like the OP.
Got it while on promo in local store"
2024-09-07,There are refurbished ones too. I found my XM5 on AMZ for $160.
2024-01-31,"Seems about the same experience as me when I tried the WF-1000XM5 briefly. 

As an iPhone 15 Pro Max user with AirPods Pro 2, I could not convince myself that the WF-1000XM5‚Äôs are *THAT* much better than AirPods Pro 2. ANC and sound quality were both on par, not a huge margin of XM5s being better. I ended up returning the XM5s to Costco. 

Disappointed because XM4s vs AirPods Pro 1 were a huge difference back in the days. 

When I have extra money next time, I‚Äôd probably get XM5 or XM6 full sized headphones instead of WF TWS."
2024-05-07,"Ah the XM4s... I utterly loved these buds at first. Then the problems started...

Firstly, the tips. Although great, and very comfortable, they wear out and generally deteriorate very quickly. I went through all of the sizes in less than 18 months. Now, this wouldn't be too much of a problem per se if there were any decent replacements. I tried a few options and they either came off in my ears repeatedly, or were just generally uncomfortable/poor quality. Good luck finding news one for less than 40EUR/USD... crazy price for foam tips.

Secondly, the goddamn battery issues... I don't know if this started after an update or what, but it's gotten to the point now where they are essentially unusable. The left earbud lasts 15 minutes and won't go any higher than a 60% charge. Right ear bud goes to maybe 80&amp; but lasts 30-40mins. I also can't get the case to charge properly anymore (very frustrating as Sony advise to update the software to fix this issue. A lengthy process that requires a fully charged unit :) ). 

It's such a shame because the sound quality and ANC was absolutely bang on with these headphones (significantly better than my wife APP2). Note - I'm a bit of an audiophile so YMMV depending on what you're listening to and how you're listening. 

I really want to go for the XM5's but I've been left with an incredibly sour taste after the XM4 experience."
2024-05-07,Just having a listen again on my XM4s... Damn i wish this battery issue wasn't present because they sound fantastic (with EQ tweaking) and I would say lot better than APP2.
2024-07-01,FWIW I had the same issue with the XM4 charging and sony is replacing them (the buds only) even though it's outside the warranty. It's a known issue at this point and they seem willing to fix it.. But agreed with the concern of the XM5s based off this prior issue.
2024-07-12,Call Sony Support. They will tell you to send in your XM4s for repair despite them being out of warranty. Once they get them they'll most likely reach out and say repair isn't possible so they will send XM5s.
2024-08-31,I know this is an old post. But look up all the battery issues. Same thing has happened to my XM4s and tons of people have gotten theirs replaced out of warranty. It all steamed from a software update that I guess permanently damaged the battery.
2025-03-14,It was a software update that did it
2024-01-31,My 2 year old XF-4 are completely unusable now. Only works for like 45 minutes. Never again Sony XF for me even as an Android user.
2024-08-01,"Same here and common problem, I had them for 1.5 years and after an update the right earpiece had mega battery drain. I use it for meetings and it will give warnings on at 30 minute mark, its useless if I have to switch to wired. Mine was past warranty and Sony refused to replace. Never again.

I did read you can replace the battery yourself, so its an option...."
2024-01-31,U forgot to mention the mic is shitty in xm5s
2024-02-01,Yeah but from my experience is about as shitty as the AirPods
2024-05-24,"I despise the XM4s. I'm on my 3rd pair now (luckily on warranty) and they're starting to break too. Had them just half a year. Additionally, the foam tips get way dirtier than silicone tips and when they eventually break they are 30 bucks. Admittedly, the sound quality and ANC is quite good but they just feel bulky and cheap. When running they produce bumping noises. Overall just a terrible experience. At least my airpods pro lasted the entire warranty period before breaking... Safe to say, I won't be buying sony again."
2024-12-24,"I've had both and the XM5's are a joke compared to Airpod Pro's (2nd gen).  Sony's buggy software, firmware, poor account integration, poor two device connect, siri usage.  Everything sucks.  Airpod's aren't perfect but they kick the shit out of anything Sony has to offer.  Gone to bowers and wilkins P7's."
2025-03-07,WHXM5‚Äôs are better than the APP2‚Äôs so you can‚Äôt say those Earphones are better.
2024-01-31,"&gt;Poor build quality: T*he XM5 just feel cheap to the touch. Also, the case hinge feels kind of wobbly

Bro that is so true compared to my XM4. The XM5 (which I'm using) feels like a downgrade compared to the XM4. Sound quality is comparable but I really prefer the XM4 design and materials."
2024-04-16,"Yes, it feels like the quality is going backwards my xm3s felt nicer and had a better charge case than my xm4s than my xm5s. I might get the AirPods"
2024-01-31,I had horrible white noise in ambient mode right out of the box on the Sony‚Äôs. For the price they‚Äôre charging that‚Äôs unacceptable.
2024-01-31,"After the numerous battery issues I've experienced, and the late refund check for my Sony wf-1000xm4, I've sworn off ever buying from Sony again"
2024-03-30,"Same, I loved my xm4s for their sound quality but the battery issues have pretty much crossed any future wireless Sony headphones off of my list."
2024-04-11,my xm4s are crapping out. do I go for XM5 or airpod pros 2 now?
2024-04-11,"I got the AirPods Pro 2‚Äôs and ended up returning them. The XM4s are just hugely better in terms of audio quality, not even taking the fact that you can EQ them into account. 

I went with certified refurbished ones off of eBay, you get a 2 year warranty through eBay by going that route."
2024-05-21,Yep.  I got the XM4‚Äôs from Secondipity on eBay for $99 with a two year warranty.  They started the battery drain after 18 months and I received a full refund.
2024-11-29,This is where I‚Äôm at or the Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra earbuds
2024-11-29,I went with the AirPod pros because it‚Äôs convenience to use with the apple ecosystem. No complaints here
2024-11-29,Ok I‚Äôve never owned a pair of AirPods before so I‚Äôm kinda nervous to make the switch since I have the XM4s rn but they shit the bed so you would recommend switching?
2024-11-29,"Have you tried checking checking in with their customer service? I heard you can do a warranty through Sony but I wasn‚Äôt able to because I lost the original charging case with the serial. 

If you use an iPhone I would consider the AirPods for convenience of use. Sound wise I might prefer the xm4s but the AirPods feel better to use on a daily basis."
2024-01-31,"Case of the XM5 wobbly?ü§≠ü§£
Wow, you better not step into my car because it's doors are wobbly too.


Common man I have them too and the lid is firm and snappy."
2024-01-31,The hinge is definitely creaky and not very sturdy. It creaks when you sort of move the lid back and forth while it's closed. I don't think the lid should be this flimsy when the case is closed
2024-02-01,Mines not like this at all.
2024-01-31,Mine is not
2024-01-31,"&gt;I have them too and the lid is firm and snappy.

Same."
2024-01-31,"Honestly, compared to the AirPods Pro case, it‚Äôs junk. I am guessing Sony is having some QC issues with these so not everyone gets a shitty case, kind of like the hinges on the WH-1000xm5"
2024-04-08,No one is getting in your car weirdo
2024-04-08,Hahaha 2 months later someone reads this....
2024-05-24,any problems with the sony other than build quality and foam tips Im planning in buying one but a bit worried
2024-06-13,I have both
2024-06-14,For those saying they preferred the xm4s‚Ä¶ the things were bulky and misbalanced. You could barely move with the things without feeling like they were going to fall out. But yes agree xm4 crushed iPod 1s while xm5 are marginal better
2024-06-20,"I just wanna find out if the transparency is as good as the AirPods Pro 2‚Äôs, after using AirPods Pro‚Äôs for so many years, I‚Äôm not so sure I can use any other earbuds."
2024-06-20,"It‚Äôs not. The transparency on the XM5s has more background static noise. Some might argue that they don‚Äôt have this issue on their pair, and it‚Äôs probably true, it‚Äôs just that the QC of Sony‚Äôs latest lineup is all over the place"
2024-06-20,Thanks for the quick reply. It‚Äôs unfortunate that no one makes transparency as good as these APP‚Äôs. I even tried the new Beats Studio buds+ because they are an Apple product now and the transparency in my opinion was god awful I immediately returned them.
2024-07-01,What about ANC of WH1000XM5 vs Airpods pro 2 ???
2024-09-12,"OP , how do you use both? which is used for what?"
2024-09-26,dO 1000XM5 HAVE DOLBY?
2024-10-07,"Airpods Pro 2 has a muddy sound quality out of the box, I use the headphone accomodation settings to fix the sound. What on earth is th eissue with your ears?"
2024-10-24,Are there any other earphones which are better than Sony XM5 in regards to the sound quality?
2024-10-29,how would you compare them in term of comfort? is it possible to excercise in both of them? Running for example.. What about wearing them let's say for 5h somewhere in plane etc. Thanks
2024-11-03,"First of all, I apologize for my bad English . I have an android (samsung s23) and until now I have had the Airpods Pro 1 (unfortunately they were stolen) I was thinking of buying the version pro 2 . while I was informing myself I also saw the Sony WF-1000XM5 has which many functions for android devices, I use them a lot for work, leisure until now I have used the pro 1 and I have always found myself very well (I use the mode transparency and the microphone a lot, sometimes even the reduction of noise but little compared to the rest) so I ask I do not need a thousand more guntions so which one do you recommend? year all a very high quality and I wondered the pro 2 are so bad for android and windows devices? the best compatibility of Sony WF-1000XM5 changes the use a lot?"
2024-12-01,"Why the hell no one ever compares mic input sound isolation in busier environments like a gym, or when you are commuting or walking on the street?"
2024-12-22,"I will share my experiences with the sony wf-1000xm5 and the Apple AirPods pro 2.

I am an iPhone owner and bought the Airpods pro 2 because my work colleagues said they are very good. 
On the internet you only read good things about the AirPods pro 2 but I can‚Äôt confirm that. 
When I tested them the sound is just not nice. 
So sent back to Amazon because I thought fake or broken. 
Then I bought them directly from apple and the sound was not nice either. No bass etc. But I still accepted that.
Because I need a good noise cancelling for work.

At my work it is very loud (90-110db). Some work colleagues use the airpods pro 2 there and said you only hear a little bit about the machines. I took her to work and it was incredibly loud with ANC on. My work colleagues tried them and said exactly the same volume as with their AirPods.
The Airpods Pro 2 are not worth ‚Ç¨100 at all. Who says otherwise are all apple fanboys. I have 3 year old Jlab Jbuds AIR ANC that I use at work and they have better sound and the noise cancelling is twice as effective and they cost 50‚Ç¨!!! 
If you don‚Äôt believe it, you can test it. I promise the jlab things are better! 
I listen to music with those at work with 50-80% volume and have to turn down the music to talk to work colleagues. With the airpods it is almost unbearable with the volume.
Now I have bought the sony wf-1000xm5 and I can say with a clear conscience that these are world differences. Sound is 3 times better than airpods and ANC works reasonably well. Better than my jlab earbuds. 

No matter where I wrote that the AirPods Pro 2 are bad compared to the 50‚Ç¨ Jlab earbuds the posts were deleted. So you won‚Äôt find bad posts about these headphones."
2024-12-28,"I don‚Äôt think Sony XM5 is good with ANC. Its average. I have tried Sony Link S, AirPods Pro 2 and now Sony XM5. For the price you pay for XM5, I don‚Äôt think the delivery value. For value for money, great sound and ANC, I would recommend Sony Link S. Between AirPods Pro 2 and XM5, I would recommend AirPods Pro 2. I won‚Äôt be too worried about apple or android UX. Cheers"
2025-01-29,How does sound insulation compare when airpods have comply foam tips?
2024-01-31,Xm4 ( previous model) are great they are so customisable and LDAC is fantastic for quality if you have a supported device. And they work great with Apple devices although you don‚Äôt get such easy switching if you use more than 2 devices eg in one session.  Also they fit the ear better foam ear pads are much better than silicon.
2024-01-31,AirPods are feel better for ur ears as u don‚Äôt feel like they are there down side is I just don‚Äôt like the nc as wf are better I however like the AirPods controls as I normally use 1 ear only and u just can‚Äôt have nc control and skip on one ear of the wf
2024-01-31,"The integration isn‚Äôt buggy, but you need to disable privat relay. Otherwise you can‚Äôt login and yes it‚Äôs really stupid took me 2h to figure out"
2024-01-31,I‚Äôm logging in via Google‚Ä¶
2024-01-31,Even that doesn‚Äôt work with privat relay on don‚Äôt ask my why. I couldn‚Äôt login via mail apple account or google until I turned it off
2024-01-31,Yeah I gotta agree on the WF-1000XM5's when it comes to the build quality of the case specifically. I love that it snaps open and shut. Very satisfying! But the hinge and lid creaks when you push on it just abit :( Other than that I have to no issues with the build quality. I use mine with an iPhone 15 Pro Max
2024-05-24,hi did u experience any issues with the sony xm5 other than the case build quality during ur period of usage ?
2024-05-24,Hey! So far no issues :) Can recommend. I have read about uneven battery drain but nothing I have noticed until now.
2024-05-24,thank u
2024-10-14,"I'm planning to get xm5 for my 15PM as well, you've been using them for 9 months now, still recommended?"
2024-10-14,Yep! Still using them pretty much daily. Been great the whole time! üëçüèª
2024-01-31,"Thanks for this. I‚Äôm looking to update my wireless headphones. I currently have gen1 AirPod pros and was thinking about getting the XM5 for the sound quality. But if gen2 are comparable, I‚Äôll choose the gen2 AirPod pros. Especially since I use them at the gym for weight lifting."
2024-03-06,"hi bro, did u decide which ones?"
2024-03-07,"Naah, still haven‚Äôt pulled the trigger on anything.  I tried out the XM5‚Äôs and didn‚Äôt like how they felt. So I‚Äôm passing on them. Really liked the XM4‚Äôs and the Bose ultra quiet comforts."
2024-04-15,"Bro, it has been 39 days. Did you make your move? xD"
2024-04-18,"I went with the AirPod Pro Gen2. I tried the XM4‚Äôs, but they were too loose on my head and didn‚Äôt like having to wipe them down all the time. I got sweaty around my ears quickly. I returned them.

Pro Gen2 are pretty good, but they just don‚Äôt bump like over ears. I miss that, but in the end it was all about the workout."
2024-09-03,Just wondering if you noticed a difference in bass between the XM4/5 and AirPods pro 2?
2024-09-04,"Yeah, pro2 are good enough in the bass response, but nothing like over ear headphones. Even crappy old Bose over ear headphones bump better."
2024-02-01,"AP2 can easily get lost. I already lose two pairs. Sony WF because form factor can't be easily forgotten or lost. 

WH5000XM5 superb sound quality/battery life etc."
2024-02-01,"Friendly reminder that the AP2 literally has speakers in the case in case you loose it. Also, the ‚Äúfind my‚Äù feature if you have an iPhone works very well"
2024-02-01,Thanks for letting me know but I'm android user. Forgot to mention bad/non existence android integration. Have a nice day.
2024-07-18,Man i ordered the sony from amazon but today it was stolen by fedex driver :((
2024-07-18,FedEx is the worst! If a company is using FedEx I won‚Äôt order. They like pretend to come to your door. I‚Äôve watched them park in front of my house get a notification that I wasn‚Äôt home and leave. lol
2024-07-18,I got a notification saying i wasnt home then an hour later tracking says delivered and signed by someone i‚Äôve never heard of lol.
2024-07-19,Have had that happen and they won‚Äôt do anything about it either. Like did you ID the person? Because anyone can sign for anything. I disputed it with my credit card.
2024-07-19,"I had that happen at Christmas time with the Jlab Epic Lab Edition earbuds. The box was delivered sealed with everything inside including the tips, cord and all the paperwork, but when I opened the Jlab box just the earbuds were missing. When I reported it to Amazon they didn't even flinch. What a garbage country we're beginning to become."
2024-07-21,"I got sony earbuds a few years back with a discount from my cousin who worked at sony, and they also got stolen."
2024-07-19,It was so good even driver can't resist üòÜ
2024-07-19,"Most people that will say AirPods probably have never tried Sony ANC buds, or they are iPhone users that want to keep everything Apple for the sake of compatibility (nothing wrong with that).

I have the WF-1000XM4 and they were miles ahead of the competition at the time of purchase.

I heard XM5 is a little more focused on taking existing XM4 features and making them more compact. AirPod Pro 2nd gen caught up a bit in terms of technical specs but I‚Äôd still take a Sony WF-1000XM4 (last years Sonys) over them any day.

I own a Samsung S21 Ultra so I‚Äôm not inclined to pick a bud based off OS compatibility. If you own an iPhone you might get different features or a better user experience (and that could make a difference over quality).

But the Sony buds are the better piece of hardware no question"
2024-07-19,After a little testing. I agree the Sonys sounds amazing when you get them just right.
2024-07-20,"I loved my Sony link buds s I‚Äôd say they were on par with the air pro‚Äôs but the quality mine kept breaking maybe that was Apple fucking around or something but I‚Äôve had my AirPods for 2 years and I love them also Apple customer service doesn‚Äôt suck balls. I can find them when I put them down, and idk that‚Äôs about it it does suck that they don‚Äôt exactly have an equalizer but other wise the best earbuds I‚Äôve had. Its Lexus vs Mercedes"
2024-07-20,"That‚Äôs the thing out of the box they sound worse and most people don‚Äôt like fiddling with settings to get something to work . 

But thats also a microcosm of Android vs iOS"
2024-07-21,"I disagree with the second take. I like iOS for general use but I am still an advance user when it comes to tweaking things. 

Most buyers are average users, just need a phone that works. 

Coming from the good old ROM days, I find most phones, regardless of brand, have enough features built in or at least the capability of extending those with minimal work. 

Now, if you have a specific niche, such as being an audiophile, custom audio settings are a blessing. 

MixAmp was the shit."
2024-07-19,"I will admit, the WF-XM5‚Äôs were a neat set of earbuds for the short time I had owned them. But they were a little too bulky for my taste and I will admit to having a bias against owning any Sony headphones or earbuds that makes me uncomfortable with buying and owning them."
2024-07-19,"&gt;I will admit to having a bias against owning any Sony headphones or earbuds

What's wrong with Sony audio in your eyes that you describe yourself as biased against them?"
2024-07-19,"Probably the well documented low quality bass which bleeds all over the music. I sent mine back so quick. Even EQ couldn't save them.


My Tangzu Fudu Verse 1 absolutely destroyed them and they only cost ¬£75"
2024-07-20,I did not find the mx5 to have muddy bass.
2024-07-22,"It‚Äôs mostly how poorly Sony handled battery fiasco they had with the WF-1000XM4. And when a company is dealing with a particularly serious issue, one where batteries are quite literally exploding in earbuds that people shove into their ears to listen to music, I take things like that pretty seriously. 

And even if I‚Äôm using a Sony product that didn‚Äôt have any of those problems it makes me really uncomfortable to use a Sony product that doesn‚Äôt even have a remotely similar problem by principal, I suppose. The other reasons I might have a vice was related to a product‚Äôs individual issues that I had, but the aforementioned one above is a major reason for it."
2024-07-20,The real question is: will the new samsungs be better than the sonys. ü§∑. We shall find out soon I suppose
2024-07-22,Can I sleep with the Sonys when I put my ear on the pillow?
2024-07-23,"XM5 maybe, definitely not XM4"
2024-07-22,"I have the XM3, XM4, WH-1000XM3, AirPods Pro, AirPods Pro 2, and the AirPods Max. I‚Äôve used all of these on iOS, Android, MacOS, iPadOS, Linux, and Windows. 

Honestly, they are all good. You really can‚Äôt go wrong either way. I am a software developer, I code and tweak all day long. Overtime, as I have put in the years, I‚Äôve moved from Linux/Android, to Microsoft, to Apple. Again, they all sound good. But you are right, the Apple ecosystem is nothing to sleep on. For me, the last thing I want to do is add one more piece of tech I need to fiddle with. I want it to perform and stay out of my way as much as possible. 

Here‚Äôs my opinion: AirPods Pro 2 if you are an Apple user. Otherwise, get the XM5."
2025-03-28,"Honestly i agree (sorry for necroing post). Unlike the xm5 if you have an iphone, the airpod will automatically link to your iphone once you turn it on. Its not that much more to pair with the xm5 over bluetooth but its still a tad more convenient. I for one opted to just get sony inzone earbuds to pair alongside my airpods pro 2. The inzones are much better for my needs since they have a dongle for ultra low latency gaming."
2024-07-19,"I tested all, airpods is superior in every-way possible to be frank.Sound quality on xm4 is nice for sure but ergonomics is killing overall experience unfortunately.

Currently on linkbud s and it‚Äôs pretty decent, maybe even up to par with xm4"
2024-07-19,I‚Äôve found with memory tip buds you really have to do that thing where you pull your earlobe down with your opposite hand as you‚Äôre twisting the bud into the ear canal. Not sure if that‚Äôs part of your SOP but could help with your ergonomics issue?
2024-07-19,"With xm, it was both ergonomics, size, overall comfort alongside with lack of features due to iphone usage for me. Linkbud s is very nice since it‚Äôs a fraction of both xm4 and airpods and still very good sound, mic is a so so experience but anything except airpods will have similar experience. Airpods pro though is a beast for iphone‚Ä¶ if you could and would like to pay for it. I have money and still not paying for it since I don‚Äôt think the pricing is right with that still"
2024-07-19,"Honestly never considered Linkbud Sbecause the original tag price was $300 CDN. Essentially old tech repackaged for a marginal saving (that‚Äôs what it looks like on paper anyways). But I‚Äôm seeing sale prices for $160 and I can play ball with that price

Sucks I just got a pair of $65 ANC beaters (company called Earfun) for Prime Day cause I‚Äôm sick of financially prioritizing earbuds over things that matter"
2024-07-19,"I got my linkbud s for 55‚Ç¨. My comment is just to give the idea of my decision, main factor is still the cost of the equipment."
2024-07-19,It‚Äôs not a stupid post. Both are fantastic. Once you get the Sonys sound set up for you they do sound better. For most people the anc is better too. For me the anc was a little better on AirPods tho. Can‚Äôt go wrong either way.
2024-07-19,After a couple hours of testing I agree. The Sonys an amazing if you get the in your ear perfect. The AirPods aren‚Äôt that far off but work better with an iPhone. No fault of the Sonys.
2024-07-19,order different tips i have Jlabs off amazon and they fit great.
2024-07-21,If they are even remotely close not sure why you wouldn‚Äôt stick with the AirPods though. Being able to control things on your phone with them is clutch.
2024-07-18,"It has to be the Sony's, all day long."
2024-07-18,"If you have all apple stuff and don't plan to change that, then go airpods, it still has several downsides, but that's apple for you. Get the xm5 if you will use them with anything other than apple devices (laptop, work computer, game console, etc.)"
2024-07-19,Airpods pro 2 no brainer
2024-07-21,"Lmao apple fan boy doesn't understand better products when he sees one. Dip your toes in other waters, it won't bite"
2024-07-21,I think that fatigue of wearing Sony‚Äôs xm5 smushed your brain.
2024-07-21,"Yeah, ""fatigue"". Like your airpod max huh"
2024-07-21,What are you talking about? I never had them nor I was planning to. üòï
2024-07-28,"What a weird take. I have the xm4, linkbuds s, 2x xm5, and now the AirPods Pro 2.

Both the xm4s and linkbuds failed in about a year after purchase (both suffering from the common issue with one of the buds no longer holding a charge for more than 15 mins).

The xm4s sound nice, but they are huge. The xm5s are good, but the functionality of the AirPods Pro 2 simply can‚Äôt be beaten if you‚Äôre in the apple ecosystem. And don‚Äôt give me that fanboy crap, because it makes you sound like a 12-year-old. It‚Äôs simply about convenience.

You can also track the AirPods in FindMy (each bud separately as well as the case). For me, that‚Äôs reason enough to choose the AirPods.

And if you want really good sound quality, you need wired over the ear headphones. I‚Äôve got the Beyerdynamic 770 pros for that, but I can‚Äôt be bothered to use them anymore.

Edit: spelling"
2024-07-28,Imagine thinking airpods are anywhere near Sony. And if you're such a child that you buy earbuds solely on the Find Me feature because you can't take care of your products then I understand why you would want the airpods. But that would be the only reason ü§£
2024-07-28,And you‚Äôre the one calling other people fanboys. Oh the irony‚Ä¶
2024-12-22,"Android fanboy confirming: the airpods pro 2 of my sister are way more comfortable than my xm5. You basically forget you're wearing them the moment you put them in. Also the ANC is better, even with the xm5 foamy tips, that itch for me. I was seriously wondering what I'm doing wrong and if I should seal my ear more, but the airpods seem to fit quite ""loosely"" and beat the Sony on the ANC very noticeably on mids and people talking. And the transparency mode on the airpods is absolute top notch. So, as an Android user I'm seriously considering getting the airpods. Maybe the sound might be better on the Sony, but I'm not that audiophile when it comes to earbuds and prioritize the other advantages. 
If you want to be a proper audiophile, get huge cable headphones from beyerdynamic and use high-res streaming."
2024-12-22,Forgot to add: the battery life on xm5 is pretty badass. I guess on that point they beat the airpods.
2024-07-18,"Well both is better on the xm5‚Ä¶ but comfort, fit, controls and integration in the apple eco system are way better with the AirPods Pro. That what lets me grab them before any other earbuds most of the time."
2024-07-18,How comfortable are the Sony?
2024-07-18,The foam ear tips aren‚Äôt the worst. You have to try different sizes until they are sealed right. Overall they are pretty solid and don‚Äôt seem like they would fall out. They go deep in the ear. It‚Äôs different to the air pods for sure.
2024-07-22,"The foam tips that come with then are alright, but I swapped mine out for some silicone/foam hybrid tips. Night and day difference in comfort and ear retention. I can attach the link if you would like to try them."
2024-07-22,"I'm interested in these tips, would you mind sending over the link? Thanks."
2024-07-19,Keep both. Why not?
2024-07-19,"Same!!! Love me some prime day deals, copped the Sony link buds s"
2024-07-19,I spent way too much money.lol
2024-07-19,"Me too. Prime offers are strange. I bought them on a prime deal for 99 Euro. Now looking on Amazon after prime, they sell them for 106 Euro. Fake discounts."
2024-07-19,The APP2 are Apples best product. Ever.
2024-07-19,The functionality amazing. The eco system is like quick sand
2024-07-19,i tried both. sonys sound better but felt like they were about to fall out if i grimace or smile. after a couple months i switched to airpods and the stem helps keep it in. i wish i could have kept the sonys but them not fitting securely was a dealbreaker
2024-07-19,"I‚Äôve had both and kept the WF-1000XM5. My issues with the AirPods Pro 2 were that they never stayed in my ears (unless I used foam ear tips), I couldn‚Äôt EQ them, their ANC was good but not class-leading, they don‚Äôt have true multi-point (Apple device switching isn‚Äôt the smoothest and doesn‚Äôt always work), their battery life is average, and their sound quality was just fine for my tastes.

Although Sony‚Äôs ear tips aren‚Äôt the most compostable, their sound quality and ANC are better than the APP2. I know some people are quick to mention the Technjcs A80Z or even the Denon Perl Pro for sound quality. But both their ANC levels are below that of the XM5 and the earbuds themselves are much larger.

I prefer having a compact package with top ANC and good sound quality. I primarily listen on my iPhone 15 Pro Max, then an Android Walkman when I‚Äôm at work because phone use at my office is being frowned upon. AAC through the XM5 sounds good. It‚Äôs more about the hardware than the codec. Properly mixed Atmos tracks sound good, and I think they‚Äôre an all around solid package compared to the APP2, which, to me, only excel at Apple integration and their smart features (like case precision location)."
2024-07-19,"I found the APP felt betting in my ear lol. I‚Äôm sure everyone‚Äôs ear is a little different. 

I‚Äôm having a hard time picking one. 

The Sony are excellent but the APP are a little cheaper and work so much smoother on the iPhone. 

I didn‚Äôt think functionality would be a big factor for me but it really does make a difference.  Apple does not play nice with others as expected lol"
2024-07-19,"I was surprised about Sony having some features, like shaking your head no or yes to reject or answer a phone call, before Apple. Like I said, they also have true multi-point connectivity. So it‚Äôs not like the XM5 are without smart features. They just aren‚Äôt as much when the APP2 are paired to a modern iPhone.

Apple‚Äôs ‚Äúone size fits some‚Äù approach to earbuds has never worked for me, even going back to 2003 with my 3G iPod. I had to put foam covers over the included earbuds for them to stay in (Apple actually included these with the iPod). Same when I upgraded to a 5G iPod and their slightly changed earbuds.

AirPods 1/2/3 have been a complete no go for me. They‚Äôll stay in, I get up from sitting, and they violently fall out of my ears. I thought the AirPods Pro would be different, but they aren‚Äôt. Foam ear tips worked for me, but they were the kind that required I squeeze the ear tips before putting the earbuds in and I‚Äôm just not going to do that. It makes the process of putting the earbuds in a whole ordeal that takes a minute because I have to squeeze the ear tips, put the earbuds in individually, and hold each one as the foam expands.

No thanks. I‚Äôm glad they worked for you, I‚Äôve known multiple happy APP2 owners and I probably would have been in that camp if they stayed in my ears. But they‚Äôre also missing features like being able to properly EQ them. They‚Äôve never had enough bass for me, I‚Äôve always wanted to tick it up a notch. Same with the highs."
2024-07-19,"Honestly the sound quality was in Sonys favor but not by a huge margin. 

I also realized my canals are different in each ear. (That sent me down a rabbit hole) lol 

Everyone has different ear sizes so it probably depends on your ear. 

Sony are better sounding but Apple just didn‚Äôt everything else better for me."
2024-07-19,"Fit is a big issue. But, for me, the Sony have much better ANC because of their better isolation. Also sound quality I could adjust and make how I want and not fit within Apple‚Äôs limited scope. The APP2 sound fine, but I want to actively adjust them based on my preferences and it‚Äôs either Apple‚Äôs way or no way. You can have an audio accommodation after taking a hearing test and importing the resulting graph. They sound better, but I still think their bass is lacking."
2024-07-19,One of my AirPod pros fell out of my ear and into the airplanes toilet‚Ä¶paying a finders fee if you find it. Probably dyed blue.
2024-07-19,"Where about were you flying over? I‚Äôll start looking. 

I think you can call Apple and get a replace. It‚Äôll cost less than a new pair."
2024-07-19,"I have an iPhone, found the AirPods a lot easier to use, more comfy, less buggy, and the sound was good enough compared to the Sony. I just can‚Äôt get used to the foam tips, even when switching to aftermarket silicone ones on the Sony the ANC and sound quality changed."
2024-07-19,"I agree. Apple products on Apple devices is like Pb&amp;J. Simple things like answering calls and switching songs. 

The Sony are great sound wise and the anc is solid but it relies on passive noise canceling from the foam which some people don‚Äôt like. Additionally you need a perfect fit for it to work. 

Some people might be able to get the perfect fit everytime. I felt like I had to dig in my ear for a minute."
2024-07-19,Don't the Sonys support LDAC? Fuck Apple. They're just trendy bullshit.
2024-07-19,"I have the XM5s, they are fantastic but the only downside is the noise cancellation sucks in wind, so if you live in a windy area or you‚Äôre planning to run with them in, you may be better off with the AirPod Pros.

Both are great, I think the XM5s were better and cheaper for me."
2024-07-19,Sound Quality goes to AirPods but NC it‚Äôs a toss up. The XM5s are better at blocking HF noise that‚Äôs for sure.
2024-07-19,"I think the Sony sounds a little better, but the Apple are more reliable and work better with IOS and OSX.  I have both"
2024-07-19,"depends on your needs.

personally I will get Airpods pro for day to day use since the weight and ergonomics is fit with my ears (especially when you're using iphone, IT JUST WORKS)

and at home when you're searching sound quality. I would take headphone routes"
2024-07-19,I agree unfortunately I am cheap and only 1 will remain lol
2024-07-18,Why not try them both and return the one you don‚Äôt want?
2024-07-18,The apple functionality is next level despite the Sony sound quality
2024-07-19,i cant think of a single thing they cannot do that my airpods can.
2024-07-19,I found the Sonys annoying to get in my ear. And every little touch such as adjusting them in my ear would trigger some action.
2024-07-18,I felt bad about opening the boxes and returning lol
2024-07-19,"Dont. Its amazon, they dont give two fucks about you or you returning things. 

Try both out. Listen to your music. Whatever sounds better to you with whatever functionality extras that make sense you should keep."
2024-07-19,Airpods
2024-07-19,"Tried both, the Sonys just have a very bassy and dark sound, to my ear the AirPods Pro 2 are much clearer, and instruments are easier to distinguish. The Spatial Audio functionality is also pretty damn good, a lot of the Atmos mixes on Apple Music are impressive. I say keep the AirPods if you have an iPhone/"
2024-07-19,"interesting, for me the Airpods sound like Beats headphones, exagerated V equalisation. The sonys are more balanced, with a better response across the spectrum. My office speakers are PMC DB1 Golds and the Sonys are more akin to them."
2024-07-19,"Basic frequency response graphs do not match this though, Sonys have always been notoriously bass focused"
2024-07-19,"No they haven't. Scroll down to see the frequency graph Mr Apple Fan

https://www.soundguys.com/sony-wf-1000xm5-review-95465/"
2024-07-19,"Why are you name calling? Look at the actual frequency response comparison, the Sonys have a HUGE hump from 500 to 50 hz compared to the AirPods Pro 2. 

It‚Äôs very obvious the Sonys are very bass heavy unless you just don‚Äôt know how to read a frequency response graph. 

https://www.soundguys.com/sony-wf-1000xm5-vs-apple-airpods-pro-2-95460/#"
2024-07-19,"You're right you don't know how to read it.

You can clearly see the Airpods reach higher on the graph around the 20hz-50hz (that means more bass at that frequency) rolls off more than the Sony's towards the mids, but also doesnt peak as high as the Sony's at the 5k. So whilst the Sonys may carry +db bass between 50hz to 500hz, its only marginal when compared to the Airpods. But the airpods dont peak as much as the Sonys in the highs. So you cant say ""Sony is notorious bass focused"" when the airpods do pretty much the same.

Here is a top notch sony headphone, please look at the sound curve and stop your generalization.

2024-07-19,"alright Im not gonna continue this convo, you have no idea what you are talking about. First off your own link literally disagrees with you

&gt;This bump in bass and¬†[mid-bass frequencies](https://www.soundguys.com/frequency-response-understanding-sounds-24156/)¬†explains why cellos, synth pads, and other bassy tones can sound more prominent than¬†[the ideal](https://www.soundguys.com/what-are-the-best-sounding-headphones-90143/).¬†

&gt;Regarding sound quality, Apple‚Äôs earbuds align closely with our headphone preference curve ‚Äî more so than the Sony WF-1000XM5. We expect you‚Äôll prefer the out-of-the-box sound of the AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) to Sony‚Äôs offering

and then, you are trying to compare how an overhead headphone, which interacts with the entire ear and pinna sounds like to an earbud? lol

I love sony, I have their IER-M9, MDR-1am2, and XM5 over ear but its ok to acknowledge that on alot of consumer products sony \*does\* tend to overemphasize the bass. This has been true of the over ear XM3, 4, 5 as well as the in ear models too."
2024-07-19,"You just continued the convo after saying you wouldn't lol. 

I'm calling you out on sayinh Sony being notorious bass lovers. That's like saying beyerdynamic are notoriously bright because of the dt1990. 

Secondly, that extract is comparing sony to their ideal curve not the airpods curve. 

Just stop generalising and making wild sweeping statements."
2024-07-19,FYI you can hear Atmos/Spatial Audio on the Sonys as well.  It doesn't do the head tracking
2024-07-19,"It‚Äôs not the same, while yes any headphone can play back an Atmos file, only AirPods Pro 2s are able to have the most accurate and best sounding reproduction, due to the fact that Apple is able to factor for HRTF with the personalized head scan. 

Atmos music even sounds slightly worse/different when playing it on tidal with the AirPods Pro 2, so to get the most out of it you will need to use the AirPods Pro 2 + head scan + Apple Music."
2024-07-19,"I can't say I notice a big difference between experiencing Atmos on AirPods versus the Sony.  Yes, as I said, head tracking is not available on the Sony.  

My point was simply to make it clear that you can hear spatial audio on the Sony earbuds as well as AirPods. We can all make our own qualitative decisions on the differences."
2024-07-19,"I understand, Im just sharing my own experience having tried both. In general if you are an apple music/ iOS user its probably best to stick to airpods, while sonys could do more on android with their higher res codec (LDAC)."
2024-07-19,"Yes.  To be clear I'm not advocating for anything, just stating outright that you can experience Atmos/Spatial Audio on Sony headphones and earbuds.

2024-07-19,"I can only give a one sided opinion cause I just got the pros coming from Bose QC2

But I HIGHLY recommend you get foam tips- currently going back and forth between comply foam and foam masters but man‚Ä¶. Foam tips are game changers"
2024-07-19,"If I had an iPhone (which I don't), airpods pro 2 would be a no-brainer for me. ANC and sound quality are definitely up there for my ears.   But this is why I don't get iPhone. I don't want all my technology choices limited.  XM5 is definitely a good all-rounder even for iPhone. Can't go wrong."
2024-07-19,"If you have an iPhone you should get the Airpods Pro 2, no doubt. Also Airpods have superior ANC¬†than any earbuds out there."
2024-07-19,"How‚Äôs the comfort? I lose one piece of xm4, then bought airpods pro. I find airpods more comfortable, and WAY better anc. But sony‚Äôs batteries last 2-3 hours longer"
2024-07-19,"For comfort. The Sonys need to be perfect to get the full effect. I found my right ear was harder to fit than the left. Which sent me down a is one ear hole bigger than the other rabbit hole lol. 

The Sony‚Äôs aren‚Äôt uncomfortable but I can see how someone would find them uncomfortable. 

I liked the fit of the Air Pods and the functionality. 

Sonys had better sound quality and anc when fit perfectly. 

Since the AirPods were a little less and more suited for everyday I think that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm going with. 

If someone didn‚Äôt care about the functionality or didn‚Äôt have an iPhone the Sony were amazing. Although I have not tried any other brand."
2024-07-19,"Sony are known for poor sound quality.


You pay that much money for worse sound quality than ¬£25 IEMs"
2024-07-19,man i cant find a single example of them being known for this... lol.
2024-07-19,Air pods pro 2 sound way better than xm5
2024-07-19,"Apple functionality isn‚Äôt that much more incredible, it‚Äôs just more streamlined and seamless. I prefer the Sonys even on an iPhone. The form factor alone is a good enough reason to not get AirPods. The dangling bit is pointless and gets caught on everything."
2024-07-19,Call quality? All my buds are choppy.
2024-07-19,How is the call quality for the person on the other end? So many earphones (even the good quality expensive ones ) have terrible ambient noise
2024-07-21,Both are about equal in call quality.
2024-07-21,"Good to know, thanks!"
2024-07-19,"The AirPods Pro are more aesthetically pleasing but you pay the Apple tax, they only work well on Apple products, and they are too generic. The XM5 is just ugly but you can manage it on an Android phone. 

I would begrudgingly pick the XM5."
2024-07-19,This one is cool
2024-07-19,Sony üëålove mine üëç
2024-07-19,"xm5 and by a mile , bro ,them  noise canceling only lose to bose quiet comfort a little bit but the sound is so much better , only problem is the xm serie only last for a about a year and a half , i had xm3 ,4 and 5 average a year and a half of heavy and abuse use"
2024-07-19,Just get the Sony XM5 if you're an Android user. AirPods are never for any Android.
2024-07-19,"Really wanted the Airpods Pro as I am in the Apple ecosystem, but after listening to the XM5's they are a world apart. Good quality audio is my prime driver and the Sony's have it in spades. I lose some convenience but the N/C and the audio quality are so much better."
2024-07-19,If you cared about audio quality then you wouldn't be buying wireless buds. You'd be buying IEMs. I have ¬£25 Chi-fi IEMs which objectively sound better than any Sony XM series.
2024-07-19,"I never said I didn't own IEMs, other headphones or DAPs to play my music. I own a lot of hifi, but this thread was about XM5s vs ipod Pros. Please stick to chewing crayons. And your chifi iems are junk"
2024-07-19,Sony any day of the year
2024-07-19,I have both and the sonys blow them away. i have an iphone and have never had any issues with pairing and they have better mic quality. keep the sonys.
2024-07-19,Leaning towards APP honestly. As much as I like the sound quality of the Sony the AAP were overall less annoying
2024-07-19,AirPods just seamless if you have an iPhone
2024-07-19,"I really like the XM5's, the new X driver is amazing."
2024-07-19,Sonys! I also got them yesterday and love them
2024-07-19,Wow that‚Äôs crazy I got my graphics card stolen 2 times when I was building my pc so you could imagine the frustration And I got notifications that it was delivered on one and not home from the other I had  to make claims in them it took almost a month and half when it was supposed to only take like 4 days üò≠
2024-07-19,Bought the girlfriend airpods because she has an iPhone and cares about the name and looks - I bought myself the sony's because they're the market leader and objectively the best by far.
2024-07-20,"Go for airport, I didn't have good experience with either xm3s or xm5s. Battery degradation for me is worst on sony compared to any earbuds have used (barring a 10$ Chinese one)

My wife's airpod pro are still going strong."
2024-07-20,"I owned the air pod pros &amp; air pod pros 2, the XM5 are way better imo"
2024-07-20,Sony for me. I had two different sets of AirPods and my ear canals were too small for both sets.
2024-07-20,It‚Äôs a ‚Äúdo you like to advertise wealth vs do you like your music to sound amazinger‚Äù thing
2024-07-20,"If you don't care about all the features of airpods, the. Definitely keep the xm5. Xm5 has way better sound quality. The only better thing that airpods have are the features for the apple."
2024-07-20,"Having used both xm4 and air pods 1st gen when I'm an android user, I would pick airpods any day. Really disappointed by the battery issue on xm4, and noise cancelling isn't that much different between the 2 when Sony requires foam ear tips for a good seal causing discomfort when wearing for a long time, while airpods achieve similar level of anc while being extremely comfortable. Plus with an iPhone u get a lot of the nice to have features that I didn't. Also the price tag is pretty different between the 2 and I don't think Sony can justify the price difference with its advantages."
2024-07-20,"I love my Sonys. They don't harass me and turn on features I never want on. I put them in, and off I go.

Former airpod pro 2 user. ""Follow Iphone"" (head tracking bs) turned on every time I used them. The issue was knows for years but never fixed. Even in settings the switch appeared off. So I would have to turn the setting ""on"" then back off. Every single time. No official fix for this btw so if you encounter this bug, good luck.

The second my airpods were stolen, I never went back. I got the Sonys, put them, and they work. They sound and better than my airpods ever did.

Also I almost always had trouble connecting it to something not Apple made. And yet again the Sonys just work with no fuss."
2024-07-20,Jabra elite 10 is the most comfortable (meaning best‚Ä¶to me) earbuds I‚Äôve ever used
2024-07-20,"I think it depends on what you‚Äôre looking for. 

If sound quality is your main concern and you use a lot of devices that aren‚Äôt Apple, go with Sony

If you use mostly or all Apple devices and want an incredibly seamless experience using them with all your different devices, go AirPods."
2024-07-21,"Sony for sure! The sony's support Hi-res bluetooth codecs such as LDAC (android devices), where as the Apple only supports SBC and AAC. The airpods pro do sound great when paired to apple TV due to the spatial audio. 

I have an iphone as my primary device but when at the gym, I use an android just to play music using the LDAC codec. Sounds amazing!!! I have Airpod Pros (first gen) and Sony XM4s. The sony's also have better ANC, I believe! 

I really hate that Apple does not support hi-res bluetooth audio, even on Airpod Max or whatever they're called. 

  
In summary, if you are an audiophile; Sony! If you don't care and dont care about lossless audio (or close to it on bluetooth); the airpod pros!"
2024-07-21,"The quality of XM is quite good. However, it's a bit bulky and the connectivity issues were atrocious that they outweighed any of the positives."
2024-07-21,The Sony‚Äôs feel so cheap. You hold them in your hand and you install know Apple build quality and design are elite. Also the fit is terrible regardless of which size ear plugs you use.
2024-07-21,"Never had the airpods, but the sony's are going to have a superior sound profile, but the airpods are going to interact way better with your iPhone setup. 

Honestly, the sound for both of these is going to be good, what i'd care more about personally is going to be comfort. Apple earbuds at least in my opinion from the many other ripoffs I've had that copy the style have the most comfort from other earbuds that I've tried, but that's my opinion."
2024-07-21,"Both are great but honestly I prefer the AirPods, they do sound great and ANC is amazing. I daily drive AirPods Pro 2 but I have and use both. AirPods are definitely easier with iPhone."
2024-07-21,"Sony. IF you care about call quality at all, the AirPods are terrible."
2024-07-21,Even my wf-1000xm3 still better than airpods.
2024-07-21,This will depend a lot on your ear shape etc. I have both and for me the airpods are more comfortable and out of the box sound slightly better than the sony's but they both sound really good tbh (and the sony gets better with some EQ).
2024-07-21,The AirPods are probably really good earbuds but I can‚Äôt handle the fact that they still look like tampons hanging out of my ears
2024-07-21,"Personally have owned both.  Returned the Sonys after a good week of break in.  They just don‚Äôt hang with the comfort to me( subjective I‚Äôm sure based off peoples ears being different). Also I‚Äôm in the Apple ecosystem, the multi device seamless connectivity ‚Äújust works‚Äù with the apple products."
2024-07-22,Own both. Use both. Sony is better by a mile for music quality. However AirPods are better  for talking on the phone/Teams etc.
2024-07-22,I tried both.I would get AirPods if it was me.
2024-07-22,"If you have an iPhone stay with AirPods, the sound quality on both are about the same but I dislike Sonys app. AirPods better 100%"
2024-07-22,Hows the transparency mode on the Sony?
2024-10-29,"I know you commented awhile ago but I have the xm4 and the ambient mode is wonderful and you have a volume slider to adjust how much you let it, when it‚Äôs cranked and you have the music low it sounds like your in a shop with a radio playing it the background. Use it at work all the time"
2024-07-23,"Sony are so much better. Better looking, far better sound quality. 
AirPods are ahead in terms of call quality."
2024-07-25,Sony
2024-08-14,"I don't own AirPods, but I will just say that the XM5s are probably the best sounding earphones I've ever used, while I'm not a pro reviewer or have tons of experience, I do own professional IEMs that don't have the usable range that the XM5s do. No song I can throw at it sounds weird. Keep in mind, I have absolutely none of the weird 3D or mapping features on and stick to a flat EQ. The only sound related issues are that the upper midrange is a little... I don't want to say muddy, but it's less clean than the highs and the bass. The bass actually feels like theres a larger driver than there's room for in the buds, it feels clean and strong.¬†


It's super apparent Sony knows what they're doing. It's not flat by any means, but they know where in the frequency spectrum to focus their efforts and it shows.


I tested the noise canceling this morning and it's top notch. The buds themselves block a LOT of noise, so even with noise canceling off there's a drastic reduction of ambient sound and the buds completely clamp that down when noise canceling is switched on."
2024-11-03,"Dude, did the same thing, prolly half way across the world. You were high too?"
2024-11-03,Drunk but tomatoes/tomatoes brother
2025-01-27,Wasup dude? I know I'm 6 months late but I want to upgrade my earbuds and those are my 2 options. So from your experience which one has better sound quality?
2025-01-27,No worries I got you. Sony sounded better. But if you‚Äôre looking for sound get over ear headphones. The air pods aren‚Äôt as good sounding but it‚Äôs not worlds different. Plus is you have an iPhone the functionality is go much better. I ultimately went with the air pods.
2025-01-27,Thank you. I think I'll go with the Sony xm5.¬† iPhone functionality with airpods isn't big concern of mine. Just the sound quality. Up until 3 months ago i used airpods 2 with android so I'm already used to 0 earbuds features.
2024-07-18,"return them both, get the technic az80s"
2024-07-18,Probably should have asked for recommendations before buying lol
2024-07-18,"I bought the air pods pro gen 2 from prime day myself. Sound isn't THE best but good enough. ANC was impressive to me. But yeah the Apple ecosystem integration sells it. If you have Apple products stick with that. As others said, if you are Android and PC, go with Sony."
2024-07-18,I tried them both since posting and I agree that functionality got Apple is a deal breaker. The Sony sound amazing but have some quirks with Apple
2024-07-19,XM5 are 1000 times better than the AirPods Pro
2024-07-18,"I have airpods 2 pro and think they are tosh. Even connectivity into the ecosystem isn‚Äôt that good on mine. Noise cancelling bang average. 

Dont have the Sony‚Äôs, but my dad did have the over ears of the same and they were the bollocks."
2024-07-18,"Sonys have always sounded kinda shit w iPhones, idk why but my xm4‚Äôs sounded super muddy"
2024-07-18,[removed]
2024-07-19,The WF-1000XM5 is not the same as the WH-1000XM5. OP bought the buds (WF)
2024-07-19,Blind much?
2024-07-18,What a stupid post
2024-07-18,I‚Äôm realizing that. Posters regret
2024-10-02,What a stupid comment to a great post
2024-05-20,"Compatible is so much better with AirPods. Seamless switching between your devices. 

Also the codex issue with Apple and Sony."
2024-05-21,"Have both and only got Sonys for better fit and music listening‚Ä¶ but now after few weeks I must say that for me the fit is the only thing that is good.
The connectivity is poor and music playback breaks up daily, this was never an issue with AirPods.
Phone calls with Sonys are terrible, sure I can hear the person calling asking me if I can hear them. The microphones just don‚Äôt perform outdoors.
If the AirPods fit well then I would definitely go with them. 
Just my opinion."
2024-05-22,Yeah like you can see i opted for the airpods since i got them for cheap like 152 dollars they are used but still a good price couldnt find the sonys for a good price and the comments of course convinced me and i just decided :D
2024-05-20,Touch controls on the Sony's are very twitchy....  You have to be careful where you touch them.  Airpods are sooooooo much easier to use.  They both sound great though
2024-05-21,"I am a long-time user of the Apple ecosystem and have both headphones. What I can tell you is that if the Sony headphones fit your ears better ergonomically, choose the Sony ones. They are a better device even within the Apple ecosystem, but only if they fit your ears correctly. Otherwise, opt for the AirPods."
2024-05-21,"Hey, I like Sony's earbuds.  I prefer them over the airpods.  But if you have an iPhone then it's a no-brainer. Just get the airpods.  Codecs / features play better."
2024-05-21,"I can speak as a owner of app2, I have been using them for more than a year at this point and even today I still like them like the day I bought them (keep in mind I daily drive a samsung phone and got whxm3 sony's, so I'm not your average fanboy). 

But speaking of the airpods, sound is really good with a balanced amount of bass that doesn't ruin the songs, anc wise the airpods completely destroy my sony headphones both in anc and in transparency mode where apple is probably the only brand putting a transparency mode wich is so similar to real life that you could even forget you're wearing them.
Speaking of fit I have always liked the fit of airpods, they are so comfortable and once you put them on you won't need to constantly fix the position of the bud, I also use them for gym. My last pair of earbuds where the huawei freebuds pro (gen 1) wich for the price where really good but the fit was atrocious in my opinion, when I seitched to the airpods the difference was day and night.

These where my opinion on the app2, they have been really good for me and I had no issues with the battery.


Lastly I would like to talk about ankther pair of earbuds that I tried lately that might interest you, the galaxy buds 2 pro.
Speaking of price you can find them 100‚Ç¨ less than the airpods if not less, but music wise the sound is more rich and engaging than the airpods in my opinion. For the rest the airpods are a bit better in everything, fit at the start was atrocius for me (couldn't hold them for more than 20 minutes before hurting my ears), anc is probably on par if not a bit less effective than airpods but transparency is where you feel the difference with the apple product. Battery wise they both handled decently my day to day use so I'm satisfied with both of them, but for the price that you pay the buds pro 2 are really a close competitor for the airpods.

Hope this clears up a bit your ideas, if you have any questions please feel free to ask! ^-^"
2024-05-21,Holy moly there is a lot to consider i used galaxy buds before when i had a samsung and i have a bad experience with them had 2 pairs both of them died on me and felt cheap even tho i paid full retail price like a dumbo but i leaned more towards the airpods pro 2 since like many of the comments say the compatibility is worth it.
2024-05-21,"Try both if you can. Fit matters the most, if you can‚Äôt get a good fit you won‚Äôt have good sound and anc. After that it just comes down to which features you prefer."
2024-05-25,"I have airpods pro 2 and sony ch720n so I guess i can answer this 
I bought this combination because it‚Äôs provide me both things TWS and Overhead headphones 
U can go for airpods+xb910N aswell but xb910 are around 4 years old model
Also airpods pro 2+ ch720 cost similar to wf-1000xm5 (around 300$)
It‚Äôs give‚Äôs u choice to use both as per ur need 
And believe me i found ch710n sound profile much better than airpods(personal opinion) 
ANC is better for airpods 
If u have budget for wf-1000xm5 check my recommended pair aswell 
(Airpods+ sony ch720n) it‚Äôs gives u variety üëçüèª"
2024-05-25,"Also there‚Äôs one thing i have to mention Sony ch720n sometimes do have connectivity issues (maybe in my device) like the connect disconnect for 2-3 minutes and then have a stable connection But it‚Äôs rare now i hv been using these for around 2 months Faced that issue in starting days but now it works fine

2025-02-09,You can find some good comparison here: [https://topratedeverything.com/wf-1000xm5-vs-airpods-pro-2-which-premium-reigns-supreme/](https://topratedeverything.com/wf-1000xm5-vs-airpods-pro-2-which-premium-reigns-supreme/)
2024-05-20,"I'm iPhone and MacBook user. and I have got both SONY XM5, AirPods Pro 2,  I needed to sell my SONY for fitting issue nothing else. its personal case . if sony fits your ears good. it has got much better sound than AirPods Pro 2, but Airpods are so convenient with iPhone , MacBook what I mean is, connectivity, stability durability,  also AirPods' transpreceny is so clear no hiss, or any white noise. ANC I would say very close each other.. perhaps SONY slightly better. but not significantly. SONY's app and features so good.  EQ presets or Manuel available. AirPods dont have it. but AirPods better fit and comfy all day long .. and mic call quality better AirPods. if I was you.. I would go for Airpods unless sound quality is extremely priority for you.. if so then look IEM TWS none of these will satisfy yoƒ±u for sure. :D if I need sum up between two ;

‚Ä¢	‚Å†ANC: both great
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Transparency : Apple far better actually best in market
‚Ä¢	‚Å†features extras: SONY
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Fitting: Apple
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Battery life: both great
‚Ä¢	‚Å†portability: both great
‚Ä¢	‚Å†durability: Apple

-sound quality: SONY far better. apple trash

-mic quality: Apple

if you have more questions you can ask me. I owned 22 earbuds

There are thasunds of post about this comparison;) i copied this
My msg from
Another post hope it helps"
2024-05-20,"up to 6 hours of listening time (up to 5.5 hours when spatial audio and head tracking are enabled)3 or up to 4.5 hours of talk time on a single charge

Nahhh, autonomy for airpod pro 2 is bad"
2024-05-21,"Calling Apple trash is just so uneducated, Sony literally dumps everything into bass and low end, has little clarity, sounds more closed in and narrow. The AirPods are much more clear and natural sounding."
2024-05-20,Damn you were fast to reply yeah thanks for your opinion i really think im just gonna go for apple since i like going to the gym and i heard that airpods 2 have a good base plus i have an iphone so like you said the compatibility is amazing
2024-05-20,"I would go for AirPods Pro 2 . also remember, Spatial Audio and dolby ATMOS there. SONY doesnt have.. it has got st.upid 360 audio which supports over certain platforms not Apple Music etc..also I have seen 100 posts here about battery drain issue over sony xm5, xm4 as I see they still didnt solve the issue. I couldnt have used mine long time so I didnt notice battery issue but other ppl here says still persist the issue FYI"
2025-03-11,"I know this is late, but I was also on the same boat but just to let others know you CAN replace the battery of the xm3. i did and it‚Äôs still running just fine for 4 years now"
