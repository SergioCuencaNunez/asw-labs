2024-06-17,"The same could have been said for every pair of Sony TWS at any point in time and it would have still been true.


Galaxy buds 2 pro are the ones to beat and the only thing that seems likely to do that is the upcoming Galaxy buds 3 pro.


Other tech companies can't figure out the sound aspect and the audio companies can't figure out the tech or the sound aspect."
2024-06-17,"I can’t speak to the XM5’s but I used the XM4’s quite extensively. I think you’re over exaggerating a bit. The foam was totally fine for me, never caused rashes or anything after wearing them for 8+ hours a day for weeks on end. And for my ears, they were pretty comfortable and snug. 

I also never really had any issues at all with connectivity.

Third, I do agree the call quality is awful. But I have yet to find TW buds with a great mic. I end up just using some cheap IEMs with an in-line mic for most calls at the office. 

My biggest issue with Sony’s however are the dogshit battery. I had my XM4’s replaced 3 times because they’d only last 2 hours tops sometimes. I know the XM5’s are supposed to be better in this regard but I’ve heard of users still having issues with this."
2024-06-17,"Hmm. This is weird, as your experiences are _all_ the exact opposite of mine. I had XM4 which worked nicely, but I accidentally put them in the laundry and killed them that way. Then I got WF-1000XM5 about a year ago. I have between 500 and 600 hours of use on them by now. So on average 2 hours a day. During international travels I used them for up to 10 hours in one go, until I ran the battery flat and had to recharge.

* Foam and fit is pretty much perfect for me. No issues at all, apart from it being pretty shitty to clean. But this makes sense as every ear is different. Just wanted to point out your issues are definitely not universal. Have you tried replacing them with silicone tips? 

* Connectivity has been absolutely flawless for me. Android 14, Windows 10, Windows 11, Fedora Linux - all zero issues. Pairs at first try, reconnects as soon as in range. I now switched to the LE Audio Beta, got some troubles since, but I guess that's fine for an experimental feature.

* Microphone - XM4 Mic was atrocious. Since I got the XM5 everyone I asked told me my mic is great. I have not listened to myself yet, so no idea if that is true, or just the previous one was so bad they are happy I upgraded lol

* Sound... Oddly enough, the thing you liked the most was what I liked the least. I love everything about the XM5 _apart from_ the sound. Stock it is unbearably bassy to the point of mudding out everything else, and with a bunch of in-app-EQ they get decent, but still lack the resolution of the XM4. I was very happy with the XM4 stock tuning (slightly bassy fun sounding), but XM5 are a downgrade in that regard.

* Battery is fine. I agree with you there. Despite specs stating the same runtime as the XM4, for me the XM5 were a huge upgrade, especially in ""passive"" setting (so neither ANC nor passthrough) they run forever now."
2024-06-17,"I somewhat agree with the connection issues although not as severe as your but advising against buying them because eartips made YOUR ears itchy is a bit of a stretch. As for microphone quality I have yet to hear someone tell me that I sound bad and believe me people I know would tell me instantly. Also not telling which buds you bought might not make you a shill it also makes this post a bit pointless given that there might as well be some people that experience your problems and are looking for alternatives, so why not help them?"
2024-06-17,"I think they are top 3 easily of buds out right now, but as you said, those tips are love or hate, if you dont get on with them you lose ANC, literally if you have to swap them out for silicone as they dont perform nearly as good, even with other foam and I tried comply and Azla foamax you dont get the same ANC. With optimal streaming and some EQ they sound incredible, easily a match for Momentum 4 and AZ80s which are the 2 best buds imo purely for sound. But if you cant get on with the tips, I dont know, its like they are just simply no good from there on. Its super weird. Its such a massive con because imagine spending that money, and you dont like the tips, and if you swap you lose ANC....

If ANC is moderately important I highly recommend the Technics AZ80, they sound really good, but their soundstaging and seperation is incredible, make sure like above you set them to stream max rates in developer settings on your S24u. They are also the most comfortable buds (for me personally) I have tried next to the Bose QC. The ANC is good, but not Sony/Bose level, even the momentum has fantastic ANC for mids."
2024-06-17,"I could believe the microphone quality is bad. I have had Sony headphones before, most recently the WH-XM4, and wasn't impressed. Did you try out the transparency/ambient mode? And I do want to know what headphones you're happy with. Things that connect easily are always in short supply."
2024-06-17,"I’ve purchased and tested the XM lineup since its launch. My takeaway is that you should only buy them if you’re willing to spend time with the EQ/Clearbass settings to find something that works best, and if you want very good to above average ANC and transparency as a higher priority than sound quality. There are just much better sets on the market. 

I still have a pair of XM5s, because I like to use them for comparisons when new sets hit the market. But they’re the last pair I reach for. 

And anyone having issues with Sony’s tips, as I did myself, the Spinfit Omni’s are much better and still fit well in the case."
2024-06-17,"I just bought them after my Jabra Elite 4 Active broke and read all the good reviews about them.  
I do like them but also not impressed, however my issues are not even close to yours. I haven't had any connection issues with my Pixel 7 except one or twice where It got disconnected suddenly and automatically they reconnected within a few seconds.  
I didn't experience any rash in my ears and find the eartips confortable, but that's a personal thing.  
Only used the mic a few times on work calls and people with which I talked to said they could hear me well.

Tbh, even though I like them, I'm still under the 30 days from Amazon to return them and I'm thinking of changing them for Pixel buds pro or Samsung buds pro since they're 100€ less and I don't feel the Sony's justify their price."
2024-06-17,"I've had my XM4 buds for around 2 years now. First pair of Bluetooth earbuds and haven't had any issues with mine except that one side would sometimes drain battery life a bit quicker.

I will say that the default sound sig was really trash imo and EQ was necessary to make them sound good, thankfully they do very well with EQ now.

The tips are obv replaceable if you don't like the og ones, but for me the large size works great for very long sessions as well 5hrs+.

Mic is totally useable for calls, people never complained abt it to me.

All in all I like my XM4 buds and think they're worth it!"
2024-06-17,Your explanation makes me think you don't know what you're doing.
2024-06-17,"I would go a step further and just recommend people to avoid all of Sony’s TWS. 

I had the WF-1000XM4 and they were great. On silicon tips they were super comfortable and sounded great.

About 6-12 months later they started releasing a silent revision of it with a completely different battery, different voltage and amperage. And during the time they did so they also brought out a firmware update to all of the XM4’s that would better support the new revision.

Long story short, it basically bricked the battery and amps of the OG XM4 in a way that even firmware rollback wouldn’t solve. Payed about $250 for mine, about a year later they are bricked (by bricked I mean one Iem would be somewhat ok and the other wouldn’t last an hour even paused. Happened to both iems just at different times) 

When I started researching it I realized this happens to basically all of their iems. Immediately returned the Linkbuds S I got as a replacement. 

It’s just a matter of time until they do it to the XM5

Oh yeah and if you’re just out of warranty like I was it apparently doesn’t justify a recall or free repair. So I was fucked."
2024-06-17,"Advising against ""fit"", a good fit for a person could also be a bad fit for another on any other earpiece, what a wanker."
2024-06-17,"A lot of other earbuds that *may* sound better yet often have poor mic, poor ANC, and or poor companion apps.  Was EQ not helpful with the XM5? Out of the box, the xm4 any way, I disliked it's tuning, as expected, but reversed it basically and found them really pleasant, and the ANC was noticeably better than others I'd demo'd. Better sounding earbuds from like Bang & Olufsen were more expensive, and reviews gave the app a thumbs down. The ANC was not quite as good as Sony or Bose, and as far as I know, none are yet. I also liked Master & Dynamic earbuds, they sounded great, but the call quality/mic sucked as did the app. The ANC there was just a tad over half as good as Sony. Oof. Noble made good earbuds as well, but no ANC and poor app. Far as I'm concerned it has to be the complete package or a no go for me. Earbuds simply aren't everything they could be yet, but Sony, in my assessment, gets more right than not. Minus the whole battery died after update and warranty, which was horrible, but I managed to recondition them with new batteries on my own in under an hour. Thankfully I had a heat gun, pry tools, prior experience and parience. I'm. not knocking Samsung Buds 2. I've tried them and liked them. They're feature rich if you're a Samsung user. But I didn't think the ANC or app was as good as Sony's. A lot of people like what they like and don't like what they don't like. It's not a war. Please your own ears."
2024-06-17,"I tried the XM3s back when they first came out and hated them so much right off the bat. Horrible sound quality, incredibly uncomfortable and overall just a really poorly designed experience. Ended up grabbing the WH-XM3 instead and have been really pleased with them. For ear buds, nothing has beaten my custom Westones in years."
2024-06-17,"For work, always go with neckband design. The mic. Works much better with that design angle"
2024-06-18,"the foam tips are honestly hit or miss for most people, cleaning them afterwards is definitely a universal pain in the ass though. I personally had no issues with it.

Connectivity is fine... if you stick to SBC/AAC. Go with LDAC and suddenly the connection becomes spotty, even when your device isnt too far away from the earbuds. Not an issue on my ATH-M50XBT2, so it's definitely an issue with the buds. I can't speak for aptX since at the time I was using a device that did not support it.

The one thing I absolutely hate about them though? The glossy finish. It's gonna be in your ears for an extended period of time, and during that time (especially outdoors) sweat is gonna build up in and around your ears. So it's gonna feel disgusting every time you take them off your ears since it gets oily so easily. 

Definitely not worth the price tag, but they sound good, at least. Overall a 6.5/10 for me."
2024-06-18,"I've had my XM5's since January. I get the random disconnects here and there but not often enough to be a problem. I get an hour lunch and I have to walk about half a mile to and from my vehicle to the building because parking sucks. So I am using them in different environments.

The sound quality is excellent for me. I have the DT1990's and Aful Performer 5 IEM at home. Connected to a Fiio K5 DAC/amp. So I at least have a basis on what good sounding audio products are to relate to.

The battery life is all day for me and then they can be quickly charged with the case. Battery life is a non-issue for me.

The mic could be better but I've never had anyone complain about a terrible experience while talking to me."
2024-08-04,"I wish the battery life would still be 2 hours more than what it's now. Because i need those for sleeping and after 5-6 hours i get the ''low battery'' notification, which i always wake up to. And I even turned off the notification sounds but it still is too loud. And yes the foam tips are super annoying in ears. Also they get really dirty looking after some use (i have white ones). Even the case gets really dirty looking."
2024-08-14,"I’ve had the XM5 for about a week and I just started an RMA for them — I have a lot of the same issues as you.  The foam tips are horrible for my ears; I have some silicone tips from another pair that make them a bit better but the size that fits best is not right enough to keep them in my ears with the weight of the body pulling them out.  

The connectivity issues suck — it defaults to prioritize connectivity over audio quality, but it still cuts out frequently.  Battery level, proximity to the case, phone charge, audio service (Spotify, Pandora, locally saved music, etc.) don’t seem to reliably improve it.

The ANC doesn’t seem to work that well, although this is my first experience with ANC.  Sitting next to a humming plane engine with no audio playing, the sound is hardly any different between being on and off.  I know it can’t eliminate the sound of a plane engine, but this seems like the exact thing it was designed to smooth out.  

Audio quality is fine.  I can tell the difference between mediocre and high end over-ear headphones, but I don’t think I can tell the difference for in-ear — these don’t sound much different from the $35 Skullcandy IEMs that I borrowed the ear tips from.

I’ve read that the features for these are difficult to beat at any price point, and I’m a bit afraid of that for whatever I replace these with.  The voice pass-through and auto-pausing of music would be really nice if they worked consistently (which they don’t appear to), so if most other headphones do it *worse* I’m not confident any true wireless headphones will work for me."
2024-08-18,"Interesting how user experience can vary. Myself being guy who has experience with many IEMs over time (starting with Etymotic ER-6i until current Etymotic ER4XR and over big bunch of many other models from Moondrop, iBasso, Sennheiser, Ultimate Ears, Shure,  Letshuoer and many others)... I can say that actually only Sony TWS has appealing sound signature to me and especially those WF-1000XM5. Not just actually very good resolution if proper setup but with alight EQ actually really good tonality and sound overall. I had XM3, XM4 (not fun of sound due to lack of highs) and those XM5 are really very good to me in terms of something I'd call 'balanced sound'. I tried some Sennheiser Momentums, Samsung Pro buds, some Audio Technica etc and for me there's always some sort of issue either with sound of some functionality. To me mostly only Sony keeps on making me happy. Especially in terms of TWS. In terms of wired headphones it would be different story but it's to discuss somewhere else... 🙂"
2024-09-12,Keep yapping trash.
2024-11-03,"These ear buds are beyond terrible for this price - quality issues, bugs and the list goes on - will never buy song again"
2024-06-17,"Got the same exact issues with the XM4s, especially the connectivity issues. And Sony is well aware of that cause their app makes you choose between music quality and connection quality. Who the hell does that?

I own 6 or 7 pairs of high-end TWS and I had this kind of issues with none except the XM4s. So disappointed in this lineup."
2024-06-17,Sound quality is doo doo compared to momentum 4
2024-06-17,"There are so many headphones that are better than Sony in audio quality, comfort, and connectivity at a lower price point. They're largely overhyped by fans I feel. The one thing they do well though is noise cancel. That's mainly the thing that can be quantified."
2024-06-17,"I'm confused by OP's hate for the regular buds 2 sound, and they definitely have ANC."
2024-06-17,"Agreed. I went from WF1000XM3s to Galaxy B2Ps and damn...huge difference in both ANC and audio quality.

I don't even use my Fiio BTR anymore since the convenience and sound quality of the B2Ps are more than ""ok""."
2024-06-17,"Samsung puts me off becuase they insist on apple like tactics, 

Stuff like multipoint or higher end codecs only work on samsung hardware, 

the Technics AZ80, the sennhaiser Momentum TW, or the danon pearl pro are better sets, but what saves the samsung galaxy buds as always is that they get discounted pretty quick."
2024-06-17,"Their linkbuds s are great!
Better than any other tws headphones i used atleast

But yes they are far from audiophile"
2024-06-17,"They arent even in my top 5 the Buds Pro 2, the Sonys absolutely sound better especially with a little EQ and making sure they are set to optimial in developer settings on android. The pixel pros are even better, but then you get to the top 3 Momentum 4, WF1000XM5 and easily the best Technics AZ80. Quietcomfort 2 (not ultra) and Airpods pro 2 make up my top 5 I have used."
2024-06-17,It's not a suprise that Galaxy Buda are good when they're a tech company that owns Harman
2024-06-17,"The Buds 2 Pro has the issue with some people getting ear infections or is that another model? 

I think I was about to get the Pros but was told the FEs were good enough and had better tip designs. Still haven't gotten it but they also brought up ear infections, which was strange."
2024-06-17,"I think that's the thing about the foam, right? I've seen people say it caused no issues for them, while also seeing other that claimed the opposite. It also makes them a bit meh to clean, in my opinion.

  
Yeah the connectivity issues I had are somewhat bewildering to me. Maybe I had issues with my specific pair, but I could never get them to connect on the first try and without having to fiddle sometimes. Pretty weird overall.

The battery was good though, from what I experienced. I also got them after the software issues were resolved."
2024-06-17,I had the xm4s thebn after them going in the washing machine(left ear still worked somehow) and then bought the xm5s I have to say they are far less comfortable but the audio is excellent and I've not experienced mic issues and only occasionally have connection issues still the best Bluetooth earbuds imo
2024-06-17,If you have an iPhone or Mac the AirPods' mic sounds pretty good but it's entirely because they don't use regular Bluetooth when both ends of the connection are Apple devices.
2024-06-17,"Some people have an issue with foam eartips. Then you should consider silicone tips. You'll lose some lot of the  passive isolation, but gain comfort, with the right sizing. Or perhaps you need more time to adjust and are sensitive not to the foam itself, but the pressure and feel of it. I avoided foam tips in the past, and thought I'd go with silicone tips once I received my XM4. But I was pleasantly surprised that they... we're not difficult to fit, though they take some pinching and heating with your fingers to initially compress the memory foam, comfortable, and did a pretty good job at passive isolation. I found a lot of silicone tips weren't particularly comfortable and offered almost no isolation. But they last much longer and are easier to just pop in your ear than foam.

Far as call quality, I found Jabra Elite to have good mics. But I wasn't crazy about their overall sound presentation or fit. Also have had Creative Outlier Air buds, and their mic was rather good, surprisingly, for the first time I had friends say they didn't know they were taking to me over earbuds. Plus longevity of the battery and sweat rating were all great, I've worn them in the pouring rain without issue, but the sound quality could use a boost, it's dated. Perhaps their new Creative Aurvana Pro with imems tech bring it up to speed with the competition. For good phone mic quality, thats where the apple's elongated styling, the mic stem, which many earbuds have adopted, but which I think are silly looking, do the better job at directing your voice to the mics, and if they have some noise canceling wizardry to help isolate your voice better from surrounding noise, helps too. There's as yet no perfect, does everything super, earbuds. After all, earbuds are a niche, mobile use case product. Some offer better call quality, others better music, still others best in class ANC. I didn't expect to go with Sony, but it ticked all my boxes. For me the most disappointing thin was that the battery on one side failed after an update. They were just past warrant too, so I had to replace them myself. $20 and an hour of time. and they've been good as new. Still, what a drag. Jamming high quality everything inside a bean shaped package is really tough, I'm sure."
2024-10-31,"They are better on battery , but everything else is worse. Awkward fit , sound quality, etc. At least the 4's had fantastic sound."
2024-08-28,"When you use your xm5s, are you using the mic in a quiet location or in a noisy one?"
2024-06-17,"I think you make a good point about not saying which earbuds I got, but I will say that you're minimizing the issue I had with the eartips. They didn't just make me itchy, but they straight up caused inflammation, swelling and pain for the first few weeks. As far as I've seen, I wasn't the only one suffering from that issue.

I'll edit my original post to include which bud I got."
2024-06-17,"The transparency/ambient mode was pretty alright BUT, I could hear my steps through the microphone feedback with ANC or transparency. It made a thumping sound with every step.



I'll edit my original post to include which bud I got."
2024-06-17,"I did appreciate the sound quality after spending some time fiddling with the EQ and everything else, so I'll say you're right on the money with that one.  I just think the tech problems were too pronounced to justify the premium price point, tbh."
2024-06-17,"What are your favorite headphones (in ears)?

Which one do you reach for first?"
2024-06-17,"Honestly, I think that's the whole issue about the XM5. I think they're okay in a vacuum, but like I said in my post, I would expect SO much better from this price point."
2024-08-17,I managed to get them to swap mine and mine was way out of warranty. This was about a year ago and they died while I was on a trip.
2024-06-17,"It's not that they didn't fit me, it's moreso that the included tips were painful, while also causing irritation and swelling. They did provide a solid seal and stayed nicely in the ear apart from that."
2024-06-17,"That setting switches between the industry standard AAC and Sonys own but not as widely supported LDAC codec. Some devices struggle with LDAC so Sony offers you to disable it.

Luckily we got LE audio now, which is an open industry standard, more stable than AAC, less latency and same quality as LDAC. The XM5s got a (so far bit buggy) beta upgrade for it, newer buds will all use it by default."
2024-06-17,which high end pairs do you own and in what order are they your favorites?
2024-11-08,Sure buddy.
2024-06-17,"You're right, I had the buds plus, not buds 2. I'll correct."
2024-06-17,"I feel like most of that you can thank the Bluetooth standard for. It's why Apple went and made a separate wireless protocol for their headphones with Bluetooth as a fallback for when you connect to other devices.

Although they're finally starting to add some codecs and features from this century in the next major version..."
2024-06-17,"That was for the included tips with the original Buds Pro, not the 2. I would still recommend everyone in this sub to get better aftermarket tips for any IEMs they get."
2024-06-17,I got the fe and will say they sound but nothing special. But the anc is perfect and comfort is good so will continue using them
2024-06-18,"Definitely get the FE, seriously good all round"
2024-06-17,"yeah that’s fair. the foam tips aren’t for everyone. and yeah cleaning them constantly got a bit annoying. My ears don’t even get that waxy, but I found I had to clean them every couple days because they’d end up looking so nasty

The battery thing was weird. I updating the firmware to “after” they fixed the issue but to me, it seemed more like a hardware issue. luckily I bought insurance on them but even allstate got so annoyed with fixing them that they eventually just paid for the buds altogether lol"
2024-06-17,"I have an iphone as well and it’s still pretty rough. that being said, i take calls outside a lot when on walks. for work calls at my desk I just use a standalone mic or inline mic + equalizer apo to add a little extra active noise suppression and compression"
2024-08-28,"Mainly using them to call while walking around town, or sitting in subway/bus."
2024-06-17,"For TWS, the Technics AZ80 and Sennheiser Momentum 4s for sound quality alone. With the M4s, the stock tuning is typical TWS (boosted bass, slightly veiled and dark), but with Sound Personalization it opens up -- tames the bass, provides much more presence in the treble and mids. It goes from a good set, to a great one. I'm fairly certain Sound Personalization is using a parametric EQ algorithm, rather than what Sony is doing with the XM5s, which is simply adjusting the 5-band EQ and Clearbass settings.

Out of 6-7 sets that I'm actually actively using from time to time and keep charged and ready to go, I'm going to grab the M4s most of the time. They're the best balance of sound quality and features.

For actual IEMs, current midfi picks are the Hype 4, Moondrop Dusk, Elysian Pilgrim, Scarlett Mini (EQ'd to the default Grand Maestro tuning), and Performer8. The Dunu Davinci is also great at $300; strong, impactful bass with good mids and decent treble. Have also rekindled my romance with the Dunu SA6 MK2, with the bass switches set to the ""off"" position (have run them set to on since launch).

Budget picks, the Pula PA02, Aful Performer5, KZ PR2 (w/ Mesh), and Wan'er.

Favorites of all time, Monarch MK2, Grand Maestro, and Elysian Diva (OG), Sennheiser IE600, Sony IER-Z1R.

Out of dozens of IEMs, if you asked me to pick one that works for the genres I listen to most of the time, it would probably be the Hype 4. With EQ, it got close enough to the Monarch MK3 that I sold my own MK3 and didn't regret letting it go. But if I didn't have an EQ-capable DAC I'm absolutely fine with the default tuning. It is one of the best IEMs for its price point in the last couple of years. 

There's almost too many sets coming to market right now and it's tough to pick an absolute ""best."" Every price range seems to have a set that punches well above its weight and is disrupting its respective price bracket."
2024-08-23,Just called and am in the process of having mine replaced as well.  Owned for two years so i'm well outside the warranty window but they said it doesn't matter and provided me with a shipping label.
2024-06-17,Cant wait for UWB to be implemented and BT to be dead.
2024-06-18,"That sounds like the ""praise"" people gave to the Galaxy buds plus. Which also happened to be my current daily drivers as far as earbuds go for the past two and a half years. I like them but I have an itch to upgrade and I don't think I quite want to go to the xm5 but since I have an xm3 headphone set. Which are also serving me well. 

But as far as the buds go for portability use and sometimes single ear use, I may just go for the FEs soon enough."
2024-06-18,"Would you consider it an upgrade over the Buds+? I know the FEs lack the wireless charging, which I can't say I use, but I still wonder if there are features ""cut"" from the model."
2024-08-28,"So when you were out and about in town or on the subway or bus the mic still sounded good? A lot of people have said that the mic on the xm5s were not great, but a lot of those replies came from about 1 year ago. I'm not sure if Sony released any updates in that time frame that improved mic quality.

I'm stuck between the galaxy buds pro 3 and the xm5s. I've been reading that the galaxy bud pro 3 has a better mic."
2024-06-18,"I've been using audio gear for 40 years so I've lost count of the stuff I've had, but I bought the FE for a joke really, they were on sale so I thought ""what the hell"" if you have a Samsung phone for the ssc codec then these buds are exceptional, I was genuinely surprised (and that takes a lot of doing), everything about them from the fit to the sound to the rock solid connection etcetc.

The first set of buds I can honestly not find a single thing that I would change. I will be grabbing a second pair in the next amazon sale."
2024-08-28,"At least that's what I was told... I can try recording a short audio note next time I'm in a loud place and upload if that helps, and you're not in a super hurry with choosing. Will be on the train this weekend."
2024-06-18,"How much were they on the Amazon sale? I only know of the Samsung trade-in offer, with EDU discount, that brought it to $71.99, or so. 

Still seems pretty good but if Amazon had it for cheaper than that...."
2024-08-28,Ah I would greatly appreciate that my friend! Thank you very much.
2024-06-18,"Currently £74 here in England on amazon, but we always get ripped off here! So 72 dollars is a steal"
2024-06-18,Ps they're worth double in my opinion
2024-06-18,"Alright, cool. Thanks for the info. 

I'll see just how low I can catch it in the next month and make a move."
2024-01-09,"Wf xm5 definitely beats apple pro 2 outta of the water, this comes from an iPhone user. The key is ear tip seal. Most will just put the earbuds on and never look at the ear tip test, then complain about anc. I live near in a rural town in Texas, Hwy 6 is literally 2 houses away from me and I’ve tested both outside and when you have a good seal with the xm5 it’s basically completely silent. If you aren’t technical, stick to other earbuds."
2023-10-08,"what can i say wf1000 xm5 sound signature quiet similar like linkbuds S, warm and neutral with a bass(heavy bass) but fairly good in detail and clarity in mids and treble region, not dark and boring like wf1000 xm4 plus the timbre in treble are very natural than the xm4. sorry for bad english😣"
2023-10-08,"I bought xm5 last week and honestly the first experience was not so great. Previously i was using soundcore and Samsung buds 2 and Sony’s sounds quite different to them. Moreover the eartips were big challenge for me, as without a good seal in ear noise cancellation and sound was affected.

However after using it for some time, and after some adjustments, I can now confidently say it’s the best earbuds i have used in a while. Sound is excellent (I can’t go back to previous headphones ), more clarity. For ear tips i tried several one and was satisfied with them. Lastly the best thing is battery, it easily last ~7 hours with ANC on , and case provides 3 charges cycle."
2024-06-05,"Had them for 6 months and left earbud stopped working, tried hard resetting them and everything, but nothing worked. They are in for repair now :( otherwise they work fine."
2023-10-08,Read about the firmware updates on the 4's. They completely messed up everyone's expensive ass headphones.
2024-04-27,"I know this is an old thread, however if anyone is searching via google and wan't a review .... The noise cancelling is non existent and I have returned mine. I could not even tell if the NC was on when in the gym. Very disappointing"
2024-06-28,"Replacement ear tips - get these - seriously better than the originals which are rubbish

 sciuU Noise-isolating Ear Bud Tips"
2023-10-08,I bought the XM5's and couldn't be happier. Excellent sound quality and ANC. But the stock eartips make them extremely uncomfortable. I upgraded the eartips to the Sednafit Max which improved the sound even more with no impact on ANC.
2024-04-04,Not very good
2024-05-02,Dont buy
2024-05-11,"Keeps disconcting when switching apps on android!!! . Missing active eq that can switch form music ,podcasts or movis"
2024-05-17,"I got them since I found them new half off and they are more recent than the galaxy buds2 pro, I think they sound damn similar. I didn't notice a difference in my typical songs, but samsung let's you tweak the other ones pretty nice."
2024-07-26,"Can anyone tell me sony Wf-1000xm5 or bose quietcomfort 2 which one is best for long run?
Coz i heard that after 1 year sony have faster battery drain issue or Bose have double sound or echo sound problem or connectivity problem so if any of you use any one earbuds for last 11 months or 12 months please share your experience"
2024-07-29,"i never had really nice headphones before and im far from a hifisniffer and vinyl expert listener, but im blown away...I jumped om the sony xperia 5 V 500dollar off + WF-1000MX5 on top for free, and wow .... i have tweaked it with 360 audio enhancemnt and i keep forgetting that it ISNT my home stereo speakers blasting in my living room .... it´s way beyond what i ever dared hoping for... you all know it´s the big thing people forget ...its speaker distorsion in heavy guitar music that does half the trick !!"
2024-07-31,did anyone try the ANC inside an airplane? how is it? i know it wouldn't block all of those airplane engine noise
2024-08-18,"I bought a pair and I think they sound amazing.  Better than any Samsung buds or bose wireless I've ever had. 

I also use these at work in a call center environment and they work well multiple hours of time in a row."
2024-09-03,"Went and got them on Saturday, my friend said he had them and they ware not as good as thr bose quiet confort ultra.
I had a listen to his and the Sony...  and OMG the Bose apselutely sh...t on the Sony.


The nose cancel on thesony is rubbish compared to the bose. I mean like mega mega another level better with bose. 

Also the sound quality is better with the bose.

So I went back and gave them back picked up the bose ultra comfort ultra. And I'm really happy now. 😊"
2024-10-05,"I have had this for a week, and they really impressed me. The clarity is above and beyond, and if i am not mistaking  - i am hearing beats and notes I had been missing on my Senn HD 650. My take is, they are definitely not neutral.

However I am facing a new problem since I have started using Sony's Sound Connect app. It has messed up something with my BT and connection to other speakers is delivering muddy sound. If anyone faced this and know a fix, will appreciate your sharing"
2024-11-03,So many issues - Sony should have done a full re call and refunded - these have so so many problems - disgraceful at this price point or frankly any price point
2024-11-19,"I know this is an older thread but seemed most relevant.  I recently purchased the WF-1000XM5's coming from Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro 2 (which I thought we great).  My Thoughts:

Sound Quality:  Comparatively - Blown away by the XM5's - clarity and EQ functions amazing.  Just really makes listening to music so enjoyable.  

ANC - Great - as good or better, recommend playing with the tips to get the best fit; it makes all the difference in the world.  

Best surprise and bonus feature:  I work in a hybrid situation - 2 days in office / cubical environment and 3 days from home per week.  The best thing is I can be simultaneously connected to two things (computer and phone) at the same time.  So I can listen to music but when a Teams or VoIP call comes in the music auto stops and transfers to the work call.  It is completely seamless and I didn't have to configure anything other than setting them up on Bluetooth.  

Overall, I am completely satisfied and then some with the purchase.  I was hesitant with the price point and concerned about the Samsung Galaxy integration.  The sound quality and seamless integration are  completely worth it.  The sound quality for calls in an office environment is as good as my boom Jlab headset (and the integration is better).

Verdict - Sony hit it out of the park with this headset.  Two thumbs up."
2024-12-12,"Can anyone speak to how these fit in your ears?  My problem with the Apple AirPods and AirPods Pro is they fall out of my ears with minimal head movement just sitting still.  I’ve tried adjusting them different ways, tried the different tips and nothing seems to work.  If I am walking, may as well forget about using them as they will fall out within 5-10 seconds.  Are the Sony buds any better?"
2025-01-13,"I had the AirPods Pro 2 and now have the wf-1000xm5.
I can say that the AirPods are worse with everything except the microphone. With me at work it is 100-115db loud. Can’t stand it with the AirPods. The sonys are just as good as the hearing protection. And I tried both for a long time. AirPods are only good in quieter environments. But louder environments not recommended. I also tried comply set-ups but no chance"
2025-02-02,"These are a classic example of overuse of technology. They are terrible, glitchy and 30% of the time don't work correctly. Randomly switch between noise cancelling and atmospheric even though I changed the touching of the earbuds so this isn't supposed to happen. Randomly pause songs, randomly stop for no reason. Third the using after 30 minutes one headphone said 13% and the other 93%. Absolutely shocking. Will be taking them back and asking for a refund. Absolute garbage, should've went with my gut and stuck with Sennheiser."
2025-02-23,"Hi guys! I just bought a pair of Sony WF-1000XM5, and honestly, I’m pretty disappointed with both the sound quality and ANC. I own several Sony products, including the WH-1000XM4, WH-1000XM5 (which I ended up selling because they didn’t meet my expectations), the XB900N, and the Jabra 75t.

For some reason, I always find myself going back to the Jabras—they just sound so much richer and fuller compared to the XM5s. I’ve tried different ear tips, but the performance is still underwhelming, especially in terms of loudness. Even with the volume maxed out on both my device and the Sony app, they just don’t get loud enough.

I bought them brand new, so I feel like I might be missing something. Has anyone else experienced this issue? If you’ve found a fix, please share—I’d really appreciate it"
2023-10-08,Do not ever update the firmware
2023-10-08,"I bought my xm5 a month ago, have had the battery issue. Not as bad as 2-3 hours. If I turn off the earphones and set it in the case, the batteries die down to half in 12 hours. This means I can't use the earphones if I don't charge the case for a day. 

For comparison, I used the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds (first generation). I loved them for three years until the charging failed. 

I preferred the Bose for sound, they sounded deeper and wider. The xm5 feels brighter and maybe clearer. Of course this is purely subjective and there are equalizers so you can probably adjust quite a bit. 

I preferred the Bose for ear fitting, too. You have to really squash the xm5 in to your ear canals, and I am not a fan. 

The xm5 wins in size, weight, and the ability to connect to two devices. These were the reasons I switched from Bose, but I'll think very hard next time."
2023-10-08,"> How is the sound quality? For reference, I have a pair of Noble Fokus Pro 

This is hard to compare for us who have not tried what you had. 

I personally am quite satisfied with SQ, and I'm coming from XM3 and 4. The bass of XM5 is less muddy and more defined compared to XM4.

> Have you experienced any battery-related problems like fast drainage 

So far, no issues seen with mine. Then again, the battery issue with XM4 only surfaced months after its launch, so all of us are just hoping for the best :)"
2023-10-08,"No one can tell you if they've fixed the battery issue, it only appeared with the XM4 after a year or so.

I liked the better fit and smaller case enough to upgrade, in regards to sound and features I feel like they're about the same tbh. You might notice differences side by side but not after upgrading."
2023-10-08,"For me I found the ANC pretty non existent, which is a pity. I tried the Airport Pro Gen 2 a few months back and it blocked out a lot, but the XM5'S just aren't doing it. Hopefully Sony release an update."
2023-10-08,"I have had WFX3, 4 and 5s.
4s sounded better than 5s.
Fit and size of 5s is better than 4s.
""Spatial audio"" with YouTube etc (as advertised) does not work.
Smaller case is nicer.
Call voice quality is awful as usual. Literally no improvement, others cannot hear you well especially with background noise like road/walking outside."
2023-10-08,"Everything is optimal. I have been using it for about a year. The earpads do not peel off, but I use it every day and they become flat. Now my ears touch the inside of the headphone. I replaced the earpads with ones that I bought from Amazon. They are not original and have a different shape and more thickness. So the noise cancelling is less effective."
2023-10-08,"Like the SQ better than the XM4.

Like the fit better than the XM4.

No battery related issues yet.

&#x200B;

I'm happy, but it's due to my personal preferences, yours may not align."
2023-10-09,"Sound quality is great, similar to Linkbuds S. I can't really notice that much of a difference between the two unfortunately though, even though the drivers are bigger on the XM5. You want to make sure that you use the EQ mode, because music sounds flat and boring if you don't set your preferred EQ. Also if you like bass the ClearBass +10 mode is great, just like Linkbuds S. But you will want to turn it to speech EQ mode for podcasts.

The battery seems like it would last forever, much longer than the Linkbuds S. I've never worn them this long but they would probably last 8 hours I'd imagine, with noise canceling. I have had zero battery drain issues. Usually I can wear them for 3-4 days for at least 4 hours a day before even thinking of charging the case.

The fit and the earbuds tips are the best part. The xm4 earbuds didn't fit my ears at all and I returned them, but these are perfect. The earbuds tips are a foam hybrid that don't need to be pinched before you put them in your ears, and seem like they will hold up in the long haul. And they give great passive noise isolation. This passive isolation strength means that ANC only adds like 10% more noise cancelling however, mostly at the very low end. You cannot block out people talking very well without at least 50-60 dba of some kinda music/rain sound effects.

Also small bonus tidbits:

I used them in light rain outside the other day and didn't have any issues with the touch pads accidentally activating like I did with the Linkbuds S. More time will be needed though, this is the only time I've exposed them to water at all. I found the Linkbuds S were unusable in the rain, or exposed to any kind of water at all, because eventually they just started pausing and activating transparency mode every 2 seconds.

Side tone CAN BE TURNED OFF in the settings which is awesome. You can also turn off the announcer/alert sound for activating various functions and changing modes via the buttons, which some people do not like and would love to turn off (I do not care). You will not find these settings in the old Linkbuds S or the WH-MX5."
2023-10-18,I just bought mine a week ago and they're already only lasting 6 hours with ANC turned on. Not 8 hours as stated
2023-12-23,"I just bought these and the noise cancelling is non-existent. I'm sitting in Costa and nothing is blocked out - I can barely hear what I'm listening to over all the background noise. Coming from wearing Bose 700 cans, it's especially stark (Bose were bought for me by work, I'm a Sony fan if I'm buying).

Call me cynical but I bet the reason Sony configures them out of the box to only switch between ANC and Ambient is to make you think ANC works. And having buy third party tips for £220 earphones is crap, sorry.

Everything else about them is great but close to zero ANC is not acceptable."
2024-01-23,"Daily user for 5 months and I still get impressed by the NC. The water resistance is a major game changer for me, that means I can wear these seamlessly from the train to the office."
2024-03-02,"Single ear usage voice echos on calls because the other headset even though in the case, hasn't turned off... that brings me to the Bluetooth issues there are a lot and that kills it.

Yesterday I went for a walk and 2km in one ear stopped working and had to do the entire walk with music in only one ear. The only way to fix it is put both back in the case"
2024-07-30,"I also live in Texas near Hwy 6 and have to disagree. I've been A/B back in forth over and over between the Sony and Airpods Pro 2 and no matter tips on Sony (Comply, JVC, stock) in varying sizes I still get better ANC with airpods like a CIA sensory deprivation chamber. Suppose all these earbuds comparison question come down to personal preference in the end."
2024-12-25,"You are 100% accurate on this. These come with 3 extra sets of tips. People have to try the different tips, it's common for a person to have different size ear openings. A lot of people are in such a rush these days, that they don't read or follow instructions. 


You can't just put these or most any earbud tips in your ear, especially ANC buds; you have to slightly twist/screw them in snuggly and wait 10 seconds for them to conform to your ear opening.  Now, perform the seal test, it will let you know if one of the buds isn't sealed.  Once this is done, then the ANC can be graded. I give them a grade of A+.


Then select your preset or custom EQ stage. 


Unless someone has done all these steps, ignore their negative review of these Sony buds. They're outstanding.


I've owned many Bose and Sony products, both are great. Which one that I choose, depends on the type of sound that I want and the type of music that I'll be listening to. I'm glad for the differences in the brands."
2023-10-08,"It’s okay. You can answer in your native language and I’ll translate it. Also, mind if I ask whether you have experienced any battery problems?"
2024-05-24,Hi did u encounter any problems with the sony xm5s during ur period of usage ?
2024-12-12,Hey buddy! sorry if i am bothering you but I wanted to see how the xm5's are now after 12 months? any reply will be very helpful as im looking to buy these. Thank you in advance
2023-12-14,"Just got them last week. My experience went from total dissapointment to thinking these are the best earbuds I have owned. And I have owned Bose QC, Bose QC2, Sennheiser TW3 and Apple airpods pro 2.

&#x200B;

The key:  ear tip fit.  This was a challenge but I got it done.  It lools like the sound team and the ergonmics team did not talk at all to each other. None of the included tips worked for me, none got me a good seal. Had to buy 3rd party ones."
2024-05-17,I use soundcore and the earbuds keep falling off my ear  do u think this one would be worse?
2024-05-25,What's your EQ settings?
2024-12-16,How did it go afterward with sony's customer service?
2023-10-08,How so?
2023-10-09,"Agree with this commenter, love my XM5 SQ and ANC. Had them for 6-7 weeks now. Also didn’t like stock tips, found some clear silicone ones with filters (“Latex” on Aliexpress) that are much more comfortable, for me at least. ANC isn’t quite as good as stock tips but whaddya gonna do. No battery issues. Love them."
2023-11-25,Any more problems? Trying to see if I should get these earbuds.
2024-01-24,">Sednafit Max

Is there anything like this, but with a memory foam core?"
2024-07-16,why? A statement like that with no explanation is not helpful to anyone.
2024-12-12,Do you have a specific reason why not to buy these? I am considering them and would like to hear your experience.
2024-12-12,"hey bro,  almost 4 months in now so i wanted to ask do you still think the xm5s are great? Also i wanted to specifically ask if you have experienced any battery drain issues or hissing/static noise when ANC is on but nothing is playing. I would apreciate any reply as I am looking to buy the xm5s."
2025-01-31,"Hi mate, have you used them for phone calls in a busy environment, While the sound and ANC etc are great, if they can't stop backgrund noise, IMO they are useless. The Samsung buds are useless in this regard. I have had people tell me they can hear someone 5m away from me when using the Samsung buds. 

  
I cant see anyone commenting on this use case in the comments. 

Would appreciate your feedback on this. Thanks,"
2024-12-12,"Hey I am trying to decide between bose ultras and xm5s and would appreciate ""after 3 months review"" lol.  Do you still stand by the initial review? Also i wanted to specifically ask if you have experienced any battery drain issues or hissing/static noise when ANC is on but nothing is playing. I would apreciate any reply as I am looking to buy one of the two."
2024-12-12,Thank you for your review. Almost a month in now and do you still stand by the initial review?

I would apreciate any reply as I am looking to buy the xm5.
2025-02-09,It's a fine and dandy until the batteries degrade. Using ANC and other enhancements like LDAC will wear the batteries down faster. Google AI cited sources indicate that rechargeable hearing aid batteries need to be replaced annually. If you're use case consists of several hours per day of using the WF-1000xm5 you're essentially hammering those tiny lithiums to the same extent as a person using hearing aids. Previous versions of the 1000XMx to a certain extent had replaceable batteries. My understanding is that Sony took that ability away with XM5.
2024-12-19,"i had the xm4s, which seem to have similar tips. they stayed in the ear very well, but it does have a tighter seal than other buds and can be a bit uncomfortable after a few hours. it didnt really bother me much"
2025-02-09,"This explains why there's such an endless pipeline of certified new looking Sony refurbs on eBay and Amazon. So many technical bugs. 

Personally, I am philosophically opposed to the idea of buying wireless earbuds because of the lack of repairability and sustainability. The WF-1000 series had a good reputation for repairability. Batteries could replaced by the end user. That's no longer the case with XM5. 

So with this on mind I will only purchase inexpensive TWS earbuds. Yes, I may be foregoing some benefits like enhanced ANC and sound quality but spending $200+ on a disposable product is a waste of money."
2024-07-25,Which version are you referring to?
2023-10-08,Why do you turn them off???
2023-10-08,"I don't know what you talking about with the call quality, I've never had any issues"
2023-10-08,WF earphones WH headphones
2023-12-19,How's the call quality??
2024-12-12,"Hi, just a over a year in now and do you still think the xm5s are great? Also i wanted to specifically ask if you have experienced any battery drain issues or hissing/static noise when ANC is on but nothing is playing. I would apreciate any reply as I am looking to buy the xm5."
2024-03-25,Mine randomly does this as well. If you take them both out and touch the magnets together 3-4 times and then put them back in your ears it generally fixes this issue.
2024-07-30,Ear shape/Ear seal is also a major factor. I know others that can’t wear AP2 unless they have 3rd party ear tips which compromise the anc and sound signature.
2023-10-08,"so far so good, using it for almost a month, i didn't face any issue with the battery life, NGL i got solid 8 hours with anc on, but you no need worry you can claim a new one or return back to the sony if you are not satisfied with their product and don't hesitate to ask me"
2024-06-20,Is your avatar Mikasa?
2024-12-12,"Hi bro, I still can’t move on from the XM5. There are plenty of great competitors out there, but I love the XM5 more than anything else. I’m not a Sony fan, and this isn’t my first time using flagship earbuds, but I genuinely enjoy everything about it. The build quality and performance have been exceptional. To this day, I’ve had no issues with the battery or connection—it’s still working perfectly. By the way, have you tried testing the XM5 yourself?"

Which ones did you get?"
2024-12-16,"It wasn't their CS that fixed them(retailer warranty), they replaced the left bud  now they work well."
2023-10-08,"Reading between the lines; the batteries were shit and prone to exploding.
Sony issued a FW update that - I think - detected if the battery was faulty and then drained it quickly, before it exploded.

The net result being; a lot of users (myself included) experienced uneven and fast battery drain.  A small number of users experienced catastrophic battery failure.

Sony only acknowledged the issue in certain markets.  They’re replacing sets out of warranty in most cases / markets."
2024-09-14,"They knowingly pushed a firmware update that destroyed the batteries of earlier units that were built before roughly around the XM5's release date. 

They switched battery models in the XM4 later in the production run, made a firmware update and never included the proper charging parameters for the old battery even though they were completely different. 

So it caused overheating or dead batteries weeks after the update at best, and straight up fire at worst.

Few users got free replacements, most were just outside or outside of warranty and were offered a coupon to take $50-$100 off a new set of XM5s. 

Sony never fixed it either. Claimed that it couldn't be corrected."
2023-11-26,Actually mate just listened to them doing cardio. I've just reevaluated my opinion. Although the sound is very good ANC is actually quite poor and if your planning on using them for walking or running i experience occlusion in both earbuds. So for cardio and weight lifting my go to earbuds are the Jabra Elite 10 with the Azla Sednaearfit Max eartips
2024-01-24,Not sure mate sorry.
2024-12-17,"Hey brother.

Still would recommend them. 

I think my Samsung buds live are more comfortable, but these take the cake all day. The anc is solid and no real,  'hiss' to my oratory. 

I use them for leisure listening at home, one bud in for the car, and work in public-ish areas with the transparency mode."
2025-01-31,I've taken calls in a call center environment with my xm5's and I get no complaints
2024-12-12,"I've personally had no issues. Battery is good. No hissing
 Bose all the way"
2024-12-12,"No issues at all with excessive battery drain,  ran a couple of half marathon's with them \~ 2hrs.  and still  had north of 60% battery with ANC active.   For comparison, my Samsung Galaxy Pro bud2 died on my last 4 hr marathon.  I also use them now at work for calls and the microphone is and call quality far out paces my jlab boom earpiece.  In short, I do stand by my original review and am continually surprised in generally how well they do everything but most of all the audio quality vis-a-vis anything else is really impressive."
2024-09-18,I'm guessing one from 11 months ago
2023-10-08,"I turned them off manually in an attempt to save battery. Didn't work, so not particularly recommended!"
2023-12-20,I get 0 complaints. And I've used it extensively in some very challenging conditions including underneath a balakava while walking outside in windy weather.
2024-12-14,"One complaint I have pertains to the charging case. Sometimes, the left earbud doesn't charge and seems slightly off track. It can be readjusted to charge, but it's a pain when it happens. The tips are an issue because the factory tips are expensive. Other than that, I still love the X5's. I'd say go for it"
2024-04-05,Yeah that's what I paid so much money on a 5th generation product for: Bullshit Sony engineering.
2024-07-30,Yeah man I hear you. I actually don't like the sound of AP2. But ANC seems to be the best. My ultimate all-time favorite is the Technics AZ80 (sound and ANC) followed by strangely enough Beyerdynamic Free BYRD (Humongous bass but crap ANC and fit)
2024-05-24,Hi did you encounter any problems with them during ur period of usage im planning pn buying them but Im a bit worried cuz i read bad comments about them
2023-10-08,"Thanks buddy, I’ll keep that in mind."
2024-12-12,Thank you so much for replying brother! and yes i will test them myself this weekend as i have decided to purchase them but i wanted to talk to people who have had these for long term as i currently have xm4s idk if you know this but many users experienced battery drain issues (its even pinned on this sub reddit) and this issue happened after an firmware update sony released years after launching the earbuds in market. So that negative experience was making me nervous. Once again thank you for replying and I am happy your earbuds are great even after an year! pro tip: try to not update the earbuds asap. wait and check on this ub if people are facing issues after update and then decide if you want to update.
2023-12-14,"The Azla Xelastec worked for me but I guess this changes a lot depending of the shape of the ear.

I researched a lot and the Azla, the Spinfit CP100 and Comply tips worked for many.

 The Comply ones had a great seal for me when I owned the Sennheisers TW3 but they gave me an itch on my right ear for some reason."
2024-12-16,"Ouch, happy they took care of the problem though.
I am finding it very annoying that I buy premium earbuds only for them to have more issues than the 20 USD random chinese earbuds.
Right now my wf-1000xm5 have a weird problem with transparency mode and I'll have to bring them to a service center to evaluate.
What bugs me is that I already bought previously the linkbuds s where I had them substituted twice for an issue with the anc and then once I was too tired arguing with Sony's CS I asked amazon for a refund.
Sorry for the short rant, but I am very disappointed by Sony."
2023-10-08,"Well, this is not only firmware issue. They fixed that. Batteries are crap too. All Sony buds with ZeniPower batteries have the same issue: WF-1000XM4, LinkBuds and LinkBuds S."
2024-01-30,"From what I've read... I might be wrong, but the batteries are not shit, for a large batch of batteries they didn't have the correct model, they used alternatives which support a lower voltage, but the software didn't account for that, over-charging batteries = very very short battery life or even boom boom. Which is where all the problems started from if i understand it correctly."
2024-11-13,"hey, and the replaced earbuds do not have the battery issue? Sony is offering me for 100$ to get them replaced, and I am wondering are if they have the same faulty batteries."
2024-09-30,Huh. That's why my XM4s went to shit overnight then. Pisses me off but good to know.
2024-12-17,"Hi! I appreciate the reply bro, I have xm4s rn but lost the charging case so looking to buy new ones. Trying to decide between xm5 and bose ultras. Hesitant to go xm5 because replacement tips are difficult to find and expensive and sony messed up xm4s with a faulty update than caused battery to die much faster. Bose on the other have connectivity issues. Don't know what to do lol."
2024-12-12,"Thanks a lot, bose even has multi device pairing after the update so that's good too since sony's had that since xm4s."
2024-12-12,thank you so much after a rough experience with my xm4s (see pinned post on this sub) i am very cautious of sony products but hearing most users of xm5s are happy makes me confident.
2023-12-20,"That's great, but unbelievable man! 
This is my replacement pair from Amazon. So both the pairs i tested, they're just good in quiet conditions. If I pick up a call in a supermarket or on the side of a road - my voice sounds garbled and mixed with noise to the extent it's hard to understand what I'm saying. 

This is my main problem with these buds which are otherwise good."
2024-12-14,"I totally get the frustration about the replacement tips, I have the xm4 it's not easy to find and they are expensive. Also I face charging thing too except it's for the right one for me. Thank you for taking the time to reply. I really appreciate the long term review."
2024-10-24,"Hehe...""I hear you""..."
2023-10-08,"u welcome buddy, for overall either sound quality or battery life of wf1000 xm5 will satisfied for majority user, unless you got the faulty one."
2024-05-25,thx for your research. i added the tips to the wishlist. quite expensive for some tips lol but i wanna try it at some point. Depending on how the originals fit.
2024-12-19,"Can understand your fustration, have used a pair of Jaybird Vista for a couple of years prior, still strong and kicking"
2023-10-08,">the batteries were shit and prone to exploding.

I said that."
2024-01-30,"That sounds 'technically' like the truth of it...  


But I'm still angry at them for screwing us over."
2025-02-17,"Hi, I’m looking to buy one myself and ,considering you’ve asked about the popular problems under almost every comment under this post, have you decided to buy XM5 or Bose?"
2023-12-21,"That's so weird. Maybe I am just lucky. 

My bids have this other issue where they always turn on and connect to my phone in my pocket without me opening the case, which makes me want to send them in to get another pair. But maybe I got lucky on the call qualily should just keep them 😅"
2024-04-22,appreciate your help buddies :)
2023-10-08,ok
2024-02-01,Oh no 100% agree
2025-02-18,"I've decided wait for now. The reason being Bose's latest update has now enabled multi-point connection (you can connect 2 devices now) and seems to have fixed all connectivity issues as well but there aren't many people reviewing that or talking about it so idk what the real world exp is.  
  
I was going to buy the xm5s but decided to wait because XM6 should be released this year. So pretty anti-climactic outcome for me lol but good luck!"
2023-12-21,"Yeah, better keep them."
2025-02-18,"Do you think xm6 will be released this year? I thought it’s only WH that’s getting released, not WF, or are they supposed to be released close to each other?"
2025-02-18,Apparently there are rumours that sony wants to refresh both sometime this year. It's been while but apparently sony has been registering two devices with regulatory bodies like the US FCC list.
2025-02-18,"I’ve seen the Wh Xm6 being registered, was there wf xm6 too?"
2025-02-18,Like I said they are only rumours https://www.notebookcheck.net/Sony-WF-1000XM6-unlikely-to-launch-alongside-WH-1000XM6-later-this-year.958123.0.html
2025-02-18,"Oh, okay, thanks for the info"
2024-11-08,"I bought them and I don't know if it was only my pair or it's a general thing but the ANC was pretty nonexistent. There are several reddit posts claiming the same thing. I ended up returning them. 

Soundwise they are pretty much what you'd expect from this price point."
2024-11-08,"Honestly i would say so yes

Expensive but i personally dont regret it

Sounds great, good EQ options without distortion, ANC is fantastic

Imo You will just need a phone that supports LDAC to make full use out of it"
2024-11-08,"Personally own a pair, one of my greatest investments. Sound is amazing, noise cancelling is among the best on the market."
2024-11-08,"I would say don't go for them. Better buy Airpods Pro. I am a user of Both.

Why Airpods are better?
1. No weird software issues.
2. No interference and sound cutting out randomly on either buds if you are in an area with a lot of wireless devices. Weak connection protocols. 
3. No weird noise cancellation glitch when there is a high pitched ambient sound.
4. Although, they offer a tight seal and snug fit. Very uncomfortable for extended periods of time. The foam material causes itching and rashing inside the ear canal.
Compared to these the comfort of Pros are next level.

Why Sony's are better?
1. Superior sound quality over the Pros but not by much to compensate for the cons.
2. Snug and minimalistic fit.
3. Better build quality, More premium finish."
2024-11-08,I would be cautious of the battery issue that existed in the XM4. I had the XM4 and the battery basically lasted 10 minutes and sony replaced it under warranty and the left pair of the new one didn’t last more than a year and a half. I would check if people have mentioned this problem with the XM5.
2024-11-08,One of the top with ANC & excellent music quality. Good battery life but they aren't the best for calls - if the noise level approaches 70 dB your voice becomes very robotic to the other party on the phone.
2024-11-08,"You have to buy a nice eartips to seal into your hearing canal. I use comply brand they are pricey, but the isolation, plus the noise cancelling, is phenomanal, sound is fantastic. I wear them a lot."
2024-11-08,"I personally really like the sound and the ANC but what I have been constantly missing is the FindMy feature. I tend to misplace my earphones a lot, I did attach it to an Airtag but it is still not as good as finding individual earpiece with your iPhone."
2024-11-08,The XM6 are rumored to be released next year
2024-11-08,"I did a lot of research and ended up buying these.  
I think they are a good investment.  
I use them every day, at work, at the gym, and walking around outside.  
I think the noise cancellation is really good -- especially when it is windy outside.

I have two issues with them:

1. The touchpads on the units (the little gold circles) are very sensitive.  I can't wear my beanie down on my ears because it will touch those touchpads and will pause the music or turn it off.
2. I often experience a lot of interference when walking around outside, in the city, around other people.   One bud will cut in and out.  I find it really annoying and have done a lot of searching on the web about what it might be.   It seems to lessen if I take my phone out of my pocket or bag and hold it in my hand (which I find very strange).   Also,  there is no interference when I am at the gym and EVERYONE has earbuds on, so I don't know what the ""interference"" is when I am walking around outside in the city.

  
EDITED to add that I immediately replaced the tips with [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B7WQNVQQ?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1).  Very comfy, especially for long wear."
2024-11-08,Im using XM5 for 1 month and half… but what i found is when i’m walking outside. Audio keeps on reducing sound and back.  I donno what this setting is… but its annoying really.
2024-11-08,"No, avoid them. You'll get severe battery issues after a year latest.

EDIT: Avoid Sony buds in general."
2024-11-09,"I would not risk buying Sony right now until they fix their battery problem, they make really good products overall, but the xm4 had serious battery problems, also heard of some xm5 also.

I own a xm4 pair and my right earphone is totally worthless, it's a shame cus' I love the sound quality and also really freaking expensive."
2024-11-09,"They’re worth it. I had them in black and ordered these. I paid more, but Sony refunded the difference. Like others have said, their ANC isn’t strong if you use silicone ear tips.

However, it’s tuned for the foam/rubber hybrid ear tips as is the audio. I’ve gone through so many pair of earbuds and even swore by the JBL Tour Pro 3 for a bit. But I went back to these for their smaller design, more powerful ANC, better audio quality, and features."
2024-11-09,"After experiencing bad battery on one of the buds on xm3 and xm4 after 4 or 5 months of use, I’ll never buy buds from Sony again."
2024-11-08,I definitely prefer AirPod Pro or Bose for in ear
2024-11-08,Can you use these in the gym???
2024-11-08,I bought them for 224€
2024-11-08,They are nice but they aren't worth the price. I wish I would've went with something less expensive.
2024-11-08,"They are great buds but they don’t fit well in my ears. The link bud S are the best feeling earbuds I’ve ever used, the xm5’s fall out or start to fall out, breaking the seal, resulting in ambient mode all the time because it’s hanging out my ear. I’d say save yourself a couple hundred $’s and get the link bud s from Sony."
2024-11-08,"I have the M4s, totally worth it. 

Mine are kinda big but the M5s are significantly smaller. Based on my experience with the M4s I'd really recommend them"
2024-11-08,"Yeah, they are fantastic"
2024-11-08,I have also experienced sound cut while traveling in metro train or at public places. No issues at home. Don't know what could be the reason. May be they have weak sensors.
2024-11-08,Bought mine used on ebay for a fraction... I think $60 and got new plugs... Doesn't hold power for longer than my older wf-xm3 but it does the job.
2024-11-08,I have them since launch and they are fantastic. My first earbuds so I can't compare with other models.
2024-11-08,Dont buy sony. 3 months and its gonna be broken
2024-11-08,Better ANC then the next best thing from Apple or Bose. They work I have the xm4 and xm5. I look the overall build quality better on the xm4 but the xm5 has best features.
2024-11-08,"I have them and they’re amazing, however I got them for £140 (Amazon refurb) as a replacement for the xm4s when the batteries died.

I find the ANC great in my office environment - and both music and teams calls are great in an open office"
2024-11-08,No
2024-11-08,"Just bought Bose GC Earbuds Ultras. Hasd xm4 for a few years during which they broke twice - bought them for allegedly having best ANC in the market. The ANC, fit and overall quality of Bose's beat Sony by a wide margin. I'd never go back to Sony's XM series"
2024-11-09,Not when $40 Iem's sound way better ... You are paying for the name and features that suck.
2024-11-09,Go with the xm 4 or 3 and pay way less
2024-11-09,Easy yes
2024-11-09,For $230?! Absolutely! I have a pair and they are amazing especially their noise cancelling and sound quality it’s just *Italian kiss*
2024-11-09,I like mine.
2024-11-09,The ANC is awesome but I had them for less than 2 years and the batteries were totally worthless. Lasts less than 15 minutes on full charge. I ended up replacing the batteries myself. Let's see how long they last.
2024-11-09,"I just got them about a week ago and so far I like them. The only gripe is that they take a little wiggling to sit snug in the ear and if it's not in properly there's a noticeable loss in passive sound cancelling. However once they're in they stay in. I tried running and cycling and general housework etc and I didn't need to adjust it once I got them right. 

They are pretty bassy out of the box, I got the Sony app and turned down Clear Base in the EQ by 2 levels and it's much better that way imo. 

I don't really call with them so I can't comment on that. 

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to someone."
2024-11-09,I find the sound quality of the M4s to be better. But the M5 noise cancelling is better.
2024-11-09,"I love my pair, but I can’t find replacement tips at the same quality so now I’m not enjoying using them since my original ones degraded. I can’t believe you can’t buy official Sony ones anymore"
2024-11-09,They sounded really dull to me like idk not worth the money at all
2024-11-09,"I've had mine since December last year. Use if everyday to, from and during work. Never had any issues. I also own the WH-1000XM4s but I rarely use them now ever since I got these."
2024-11-09,These are $**t and causes discomfort to the ear on prolonged wear.
2024-11-09,"Not at all, it's better to buy jabra elite 

Cheaper and more comfortable"
2024-11-09,"Best headphones I've owned 


Obviously they could still be improved but the sound and anc when you fit them properly is good.


No regrets, I use them much more than my WH xm5s"
2024-11-09,Airpods pro 2s are good if you have apple devices I had a wf1000xm4 but due to charging problems with the case I stopped using them and recently bought to airpods pro 2 as I am getting the new 16 PM and have a mac and iPad my wh1000xm5s are great and work well with all devices same goes for wf1000xm5 but would rather buy airpods pro 2
2024-11-09,"My experience is very good, anc is very efficient especially on the low frequency and if you fit well in your ears - it's true that sometimes you have to refit them. I had issues with a firmware upgrade, that was not good, but sound quality for me is top notch, I have a studio and I listen everyday also with very good equipment, but the Sony are my way to go on the road, for me very good"
2024-11-09,"Absolutely for the time that I had them. Battery life was good, amazing sound quality, they sat nicely in my ear and didn't cause any pain after periods of long use (up to 12 hrs) with my job, ANC isn't as good as headphones but still adequate. Good all around.

Side note don't forget that they are in your pocket and put them in the washing machine, they don't like that."
2024-11-09,They’re fantastic but I had to get regular silicone tips the foam ones drove me crazy
2024-11-09,I bought them recently to upgrade from my M3's & I really love the sound as I did before but the anc is really improved too!
2024-11-09,"ANC is so-so, mic is no good in a noisy environment. Have it from Feb."
2024-11-09,Yes they are
2024-11-10,"I bought mine a few months ago and I honestly love them to death. ANC is amazing, they properly fit my ears, I charge them once every 3-4 days."
2024-11-10,"As a wf-1000xm5, the sound is great, ANC is great too but most of it comes from the passive isolation.

Are they better than other options? No, the eartips are horrible imo, it doesn't matter how clean you are they will eventually or gradually get dirty, you can't clean them with water nor anything wet or they start breaking/cracking over the time, and until you get used to them, they aren't comfortable.


Get any other or simply wait for the wh1000xm6"
2024-11-25,I m having connectivity audio dropouts even after warranty claim 3 times. Bought the Technics AZ80 I have no regrets after.
2024-12-21,How much is this? Also what do I have to buy in your pc to have Bluetooth connection on it kahit na wala (it didn't come with bluetooth) can I just buy in shopee?
2024-12-23,Very overrated earbuds by reviewers. No sound comparison with my B&O EQ. Good noise cancellation though.
2025-01-09,"I recently purchased the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds ($200).  Are they worth it?  Well, you could ask the same thing about the AirPods Pro 2.  They both have their pros and cons.  Anyway, I think the Sony XM5's sound fantastic.  The thing is, I also own the Sony WF-C500 earbuds that I bought around 3 years ago for about $70.  After listening to both earbuds, I can't really tell a difference.  They both sound great.  So what are you getting with the much higher priced WF-1000XM5 earbuds.  The only difference is active noise cancellation which frankly is a feature that is way over overblown, at least with earbuds in my opinion. Unless you’re in a constantly noisy environment, there’s really no need for it.  You get plenty of isolation from noise without ANC assuming you have the earbuds inserted properly. I will say that the ambient sound mode is nice so you can hear (somewhat) what is going on around you, but I don’t think that alone justifies the difference in cost. The foam earbud tips that come with the more expensive Sony's can be difficult to insert in your ears and become uncomfortable after a period of time. They don’t come with any silicone tips. I prefer the silicone earbud tips that came with the less expensive Sony's instead."
2025-02-02,"totally!  I got it in jan 2025 and the anc  and sound has been awesome! I even checked it without any music, anc on vs off. The difference is damn big. The main issue you guys are facing is the fit. It needs to go inside your ear canal, if not it will have worse anc.

I also noticed that it fits well with asian ears and worse with western ears. Maybe thats the issue. But once it fits well, it works awesome. never falls out even when working out."
2025-02-10,Recently bought sony wf-1000xm5 brand new for 6K PHP = $103 (Steal price) all i can say is i'm not paying this if its above $170 i also have sony wh-1000xm5 and all I can say is its worth buying if the price is right but if you're paying retail on this you should look for better options. I don't have a problem with the buds itself ANC is better than my sony wh-1000xm5 and the transparency mode is way better.
2025-02-22,"I got the XM4 when they first came out, and loved them until the firmware update destroyed the battery. Decided to swear off Sony earphones after the customer service said to me there was nothing they could/would do.

Afterwards got the XM5 as a gift, and I have to say they are pretty good, I’ve been using almost daily for around 2 years and have no issues. Only thing, they aren’t spectacular for calls when you’re outside."
2024-11-08,They were or are 120 on eBay refurbished indistinguishable from new. At that price get them. Around 200 I would get the Sennheiser MW4.
2024-11-08,None of Sony devices are worth it. Warranty ends and your headphones will last 15 min on full battery. Lightbulb conspiracy at its best
2024-11-08,"No it is bad, the form tips are so bad, no grip constantly slips out of hands or taking out of the case, nose cancelling is wonky sometime makes it super frustrating to use"
2024-11-08,Yup can confirm this. The anc is mostly because of the passive isolation from memory foam buds. Active anc is basically very minimal.
2024-11-08,"I would say you have to wiggle and adjust the fit. Was walking across the street and definitely couldn't hear the surroundings as well on the main streets so I had to disable ANC and turn on Ambient.

I've used these on > 12h flights and they were more comfortable than the WF1000xm4"
2024-11-08,"Confirm this too, if they aren't well adjusted ANC is non existent, plus (in my case) I have to readjust them every 15 min or so, looking to get Bose's QC 2's next year"
2024-11-09,"Wait, i'm confused. Wasn't ANC the best in sony xm4 and xm5? Wasn't this a universally agreed fact or am i missing something?

Reading other comments it makes sense that perhaps your ear isolation is not good. every time i yawn or move my mouth in some stranger way i am losing all ANC on my xm4, but when i have good contact and switch from active to passive NC it's noticeably worse."
2024-11-09,how is anc vs xm4? anyone know?  xm4 anc is great imho
2024-11-09,"Yes Exactly!!
There was very little difference between Passive noise Cancellation and ANC.
I thought this was normal behavior and My expectations are more after watching LTT review of performance of XM4."
2024-11-09,"Also if you are connecting to a Windows laptop and want that LDAC goodness you can try the ""Alternative A2DP Driver"". Its free to try and only $6 if you like it. Gives you support for LDAC, aptX, aptX-HD, aptX Low Latency where the standard Windows driver just gives you the trashy SBC and slightly better AAC codecs."
2024-11-09,"Do you notice any difference between anc on and off? Not anc on and Ambient sound. 

For me there is no difference at all with anc on and off. I have a good seal but still no difference. For me it seems just to be passive noise cancellation"
2025-02-27,how long have you had it? did you encounter any battery issues? I'm also interested in purchasing but I had bad experience with their link buds S batteries just after a year so i'm hesistant to buy another sony earbuds products.
2024-11-08,Bose is still the best when it comes to ANC.
2024-11-08,"I’ve used AirPods Pro’s before and no matter what tip size I use or how I adjust them, they slip out easily. I like the sound but they unfortunately don’t fit me"
2024-11-09,What if you have an android phone? I remember there being some issues like requiring an iPhone to upgrade firmware on the airpods.
2025-01-06,"You forgot to mention one major issue where Sony (and any other manufacturer other than Apple) is better: Apple AirPods can be connected to non-Apple devices, but the user experience is only good with Apple devices. And I agree with u/ceoofkpop_ that the AirPods are fit-wise far worse than Sony's or other true wireless in-ear headphones. They are less in-ears and more in between true in-ears and regular non-in-ear earbuds."
2024-11-08,"I am struggling with my XM4 I've changed the batteries multiple times but the issue is reoccurring, I can't seem to find anything speaking about the battery problem with the XM5"
2024-11-09,"Do you find any difference between anc on and off? For me there is no difference, just from anc on and Ambient sound which is obvious. 

The seal is good, but I think they just have passive noise cancelation"
2024-11-08,"Had them for a little under year, have the same two issues with them"
2024-11-08,"Agree with the interference and the sound cutting out sometimes, weak connection is what it is. One more big glitch with them is that when there's a high pitched sound outside the noise cancellation gets messed up. Sony still sucks on the software side of things. Never had such Issue with my Airpods Pro or Buds 2 Pro."
2024-11-08,"The little gold circles are not touchpads on my XM5's. Do you mean the XM4's? I just checked - the rounded matte surface is the touchpad and it is very sensitive. 

I also recently had mine do the ""one bud cutting out"" thing whilst walking around in the city (Stockholm) for the first time. Never happened to me anywhere else even on a train or bus with a lot of other people with headphones on. It is very strange."
2024-11-09,is it not possible to turn off touch completely? I'm tired of all the headphones etc forcing having touch especially when I wear hoodies. I just want dumb headphones that will ignore all touch and control via the phone
2024-11-09,"It might be the adaptive sound control, try and toggle it off and see if it makes a difference."
2024-11-09,"There are no reports of that with the XM3s, nor with the XM5s so far. That was only a significant problem specifically with the XM4s."
2024-12-28,Same with me. The XM4s were a huge disappointment with that battery drain issue. I don't think I'll risk more money on the XM5s when some users are reporting the same issues.
2024-12-28,I had the same issues with my XM4s which makes me leery of purchasing the XM5s after seeing some users complain about the same battery drain issue. I brought a pair of Samsung FE+ buds to tie me over for now but I'm considering the Technics AZ80s or the Jabra Elite 10s.
2024-11-08,they are good for gym but the one problem i have found is you need to use smaller eartips than you typically would as rigorous movement paired with the eartips' seal causes rattling/bumping noises 👍
2024-11-08,Oh also the foam tips trap earwax like a mofo
2024-11-08,"Isn't this pretty standard with in ears? I've got a pair of JBL, and they don't really do much either. Just dulls droning noise a bit."
2024-11-09,"Hey, bro. What does the ""a"" in anc stand for?"
2024-11-09,"Wouldn't be hard.  I have the WF-1000xm3s, and don't like the very much.

I've used every variation of them supplied tips and they are either too tight and won't fit properly, or too loose and fall out.  Either way, they need constant adjustment. 

I recently bought a pair of WH-1000xm4s.  Massive improvement in comfort and NC.  Definitely won't go back to buds."
2024-11-09,"Idk why windows is so shit with color gamuts and and wireless stuff

I have tried this program and it works great"
2025-03-15,Wait you have to pay for the good Bluetooth codecs on Windows? Thats wild 😭😭 LDAC just worked OOTB on Linux once connected
2025-03-15,Wait you have to pay for the good Bluetooth codecs on Windows? Thats wild.. LDAC just worked OOTB on Linux once connected
2024-11-09,"The difference is very much noticeable, especially with movement. You might've gotten a faulty pair or have a poor seal. Something else to consider is that ANC rn is more capable of blocking out lower frequency sounds, less of higher. That means like a crowded area, or a cafe atmosphere."
2025-02-27,"About 6 months now. No battery problems, still getting me through nearly 10 to 12 hours with ANC or Transparency. I've used the XM4s and LinkBuds before, and I can say that I've had issues with both in terms of connectivity. As for battery, I think that's an issue with earlier models, it should be a lot less prevalent with the XM5s"
2024-11-08,"Was, they were the best, but have since been overtaken."
2024-11-08,Bose hasn't been the best inactive noise canceling since the XM3s came out.
2024-11-09,Yh it happens. There's always a tradeoff between comfort and snug fit. Even for me the Pros feel like they are gonna come out but they don't.
2024-11-09,"Well, If u want Airpods u gotta have Iphone. And for Android, I would suggest the WHs over the WFs."
2025-01-06,"Yh after much usage, I realized Airpods Pros also suffer from connection issues in an environment with a lot of wireless signals. And Tbh I have gotten used to the Sony's foam now. I guess I will recommend the Sony's much more than I used to. But if I want to wear something for an extended period like in Office, I would choose the Pros. And if I want to Enjoy the sound and music I would prefer the XM5s."
2024-11-18,I know it’s not a known issue so far for XM5 except I saw someone who mentioned their xm5 had the same issue as the xm4 in the subreddit. Possibly could just be sony’s QC issue but I didn’t want to leave that part out. I just went back to the airpods pro because I broke the ribbon cable while trying yo fix my battery issue.
2024-11-09,"There is some difference in low frequencies but it isn't much. Yes, their legendary ANC performance is primarily from the specially designed foam tips, which seal much better than silicone tips."

2024-11-08,Airpods Pro 2 disagrees with your comment
2024-11-08,Yeah the memory foam helps a lot. If its a silicone bud the passive isolation wouldn’t be that great either.
2024-11-09,Active
2025-03-15,"I think it depends on the the hardware. For instance, Realtek provides A2DP drivers out of the box but Mediatek does not. For me at least, so A2DP is a fine option because it also gives me apt-x and other codec support and allows me to push all your devices bitrate beyond what the provider gives you."
2024-11-09,Thanks! With my pair even with music at almost full volume I can hear people laughing or even talking. I guess I will send them back for a revision.
2025-01-27,uh oh. WH sound muddy. Sony is reputable only in in-ears.
2024-11-18,"I have repaired mine multiple times but the issue always reoccurs, I enjoyed the sound of my XM4 but the amount of ongoing issues with the top brand of their products has driven me away.

I am not a fan of apple earbuds so it looks like I'll grab a pair of Bose during Black Friday and give them a chance."
2024-11-10,So it's more of a passive noise cancellation. The isolation is pretty good
2024-11-11,"Did you even remotely read through the linked thread?

OP suggest that MAYBE there's the same issue for them, but posts about having mixed nonconclusive results.

Most of the responses are XM4 users eager to keep updated.

Compared to the statistically significant cases of the XM4s, this doesn't showcase a rampant widespread problem as with the XM4s.

Next time actually Do Your Own Research proper..."
2024-11-09,Best ANC you can buy at that form factor.
2024-11-08,Ok
2024-11-09,Meh the AirPods are meh in ANC. I turn it off tbh to save on battery life
2024-11-11,Read gilad8897's comment...
2024-11-09,"Actually no the xm5 ANC is just as good as apples but I think they have bad QC issues with the xm5 just like Samsung has with the buds 3 pro. The screenshot is from a yt channel they do amazing headphone reviews with a lot of detail a lot of measurements and also samples to compare the different audio quality and ambient and anc functions. They also test new firmware and how they impact sound+ they test aftermarket eartips and also give representations of how they sound compared to the regular tips.

2024-08-09,Bought mine this year. Both the earbuds and headphones in this series. Very happy with both.
2024-08-09,They're great. I've had them since launch. No real complaints.. like any buds..you've got to find the tip type and size that works best for you.
2024-08-09,"I have no real issues with them and I am a fan of the sound quality. I don't mind the glossy look and it's only on the sides, not where the touch sensors are. Personally, I think the case feels kind of cheap so I have been using a silicone case. The eartips aren't the best for longevity but I have heard about decent replacements. I would say they are fully worth purchasing but I recommend trying to find them at a discount"
2024-08-09,I still have my wf-1000xm3 since 2020. The only earbuds that I can stand in my ear for more than 5 minutes.
2024-08-09,"Absolutely enjoy them. They are not perfect but the fit is pretty good for me - became even better after a couple of weeks. 
Sound quality for music is stunning. ANC is also good. I would just like to get more customization options for the touch controls. 
Connection and interruption issues are fixed for me with the latest firmware update."
2024-08-09,Got mine last December. I don't really have any complaints. I use them almost everyday.
2024-08-09,Any battery issues similar to the XM4's?
2024-08-09,I have mine since release and I don't have any complaints. They were my first earbuds so I can't give you a comparison. But overall audio quality and battery are really excellent imo.
2024-08-09,"Yes, these earbuds that were released mid 2023 are still worth it barely one year later"
2024-08-09,"Bought xm5s last week, after xm4's battery life degraded. 

Overall they're nice, but the two major differences between switching are:

1. If you ever ride a bike with them, or live in a particularly windy area, then the xm4s with auto wind reduction are much better. There isn't this option for xm5 unfortunately, so the only combat is turning your audio up more. 

2. The controls are less customisable, and arguably harder to use, but getting used to them so more of a minor point. 

The battery life is leaps and bounds past the xm4s though so it all depends on your use case, but would definitely consider those as a competitor still if you're not going to use them for more than 4 hours at a time"
2024-08-09,"I bought the XM5s 2 weeks ago and the hinge on the case is already coming loose, for reference I had the XM3s for years without ever having an issue. Everything else is great for the most part, they’re kinda ugly and look cheap for the price but I don’t really care about that"
2024-08-09,"love mine, the only thing i dislike is the app. seems like it forgets my last used anc setting."
2024-08-09,"I've been pretty happy with them, in terms of sound quality (LDAC) and the NC is not bad. However, mine just broke after 8 months and just sent them back for warranty replacement. Right earbud sound died."
2024-08-09,"I sometimes struggle putting them back in their case, they only go one way and sometimes i wish they would just snap in easier.

Very occasionally i try put the L in the R slot in a dark bedroom or so and that takes me too much time to figure out it will never find a way to fit.

Am i the only one?"
2024-08-09,"I think you just missed the Cyber Monday deal, but definitely worth it. I got the warranty just in case."
2024-08-09,Just got mine brand new having come from the XM4s. The noise cancelling is absolutely abysmal. Genuinely less than 5% difference between the ANC being on vs off.
2024-08-09,"Interestingly enough..if i had to choose again I would just buy the link buds s. I owned wf5s and link buds s and wfs definitely sounded better, but you hardly notice the buds s in your ear. It's crazy how light they are. I didn't have no issues with buds s myself and it probably saves you around 100$"
2024-08-10,"They’re ok overall for music but had some issues with messenger and streaming at discord. Messenger sometimes doesn’t auto detect them or mic doesn’t pick up as well. As for Discord, you can’t listen to videos you share while streaming."
2024-08-10,They are great not going to lie but do keep in mind they less durable than the XM3/4 atleast that us what people say have not noticed it my self yet
2024-08-10,"I bought used xm4 for 80€, amazing headphones to this date. Think you will be very happy with xm5s"
2024-08-10,"It always strikes me as odd when people suggest headphones or earbuds may not be worth it just because the model has been out for some time. The primary value of these products is sound quality, and the WF-1000XM5s still sound amazing. They are worth it."
2024-08-11,"Mac and Google Pixel connection and sound is great. Noise cancelling is really good.

Windows 11 connection sucks. Very thin sound. Its a known problem. There is a solution for it (remove a device in device list) but it should handled by Sony."
2024-08-20,"I got gifted a pair like 2 months ago and honestly I'm not keen on them. I wear them for work like 8 hours a day, 5-6 fays a week so they get a decent amount of usage.

 Was a bit shocked when i saw the price because i preferred my £50 C500's that just came free with my phone. Battery life, case build quality, comfortability, connection stability were all better on the cheaper set along with the mechanical buttons being superior to the inconsistently responsive and awkwardly placed capacitive sensors on the 1000XM5. You basically cant adjust, touch or remove them without accidentally pressing the buttons and then when you do press it intentionally it doesn't register like 1/3 of the time. 

Sound quality didnt really feel noticably better for the 4x price and the noise cancelling wasnt great either. Moving around even slightly to briskly they would lose connection for like a second which was super annoying too.

The one thing i did like was the foam bud tips but i just took them off and now use them on my C500s..."
2024-12-16,"I had the worst experience ever. (Former wf-1000xm4 user)

I bought the new ones thinking they would be as good as the wf-1000xm4. They're not. 

1. The headphones showed issues within 1 year of usage. (Had to get it fixed in warranty)  
2. Transparency mode is worse than wf-1000xm4  
3. ANC is alright."
2024-12-28,Any battery drain issues with these? The XM4s were a huge disappointment with that.
2025-02-09,"It is bass-heavy sound and has immersive audio. However, the touch controls can be finicky. [https://topratedeverything.com/wf-1000xm5-vs-airpods-pro-2-which-premium-reigns-supreme/](https://topratedeverything.com/wf-1000xm5-vs-airpods-pro-2-which-premium-reigns-supreme/)"

I bought my 2 days ago"
2024-08-09,Man when they release the xm6? Smh
2024-08-09,I think they are on a lot of ways worse than xm4 and xm3 and honestly regret switching
2024-08-09,Buy the XM4. XM5 is having hinge issues everywhere I can find.
2024-08-28,If you were to buy only one which one would you choose? Earbuds or headphones?
2024-08-11,When you try to put the volume high does the sound quality get much worse like the XM4s?
2024-08-11,"Hey man. Where I live I'm getting the WF XM5 for half the price. I want above average ANC, Good music quality with a mild high note in the base, atleast 5-6 hours of Battery life and want it to last about 2-3 years. It's about 300$ but with discounts, credit card price reduction and few other coupons ik getting it for 140$. Should I go for it based on the things I need?

I don't live in a windy area rather somewhere it gets to -10°C to 22°C and rains often."
2024-08-09,"Loved the XM3s, I’ve only just upgraded to the XM5s and they are definitely less comfy. Sound isn’t noticeably different but the connectivity and battery life are great"
2025-02-26,I just got a refund from where I bought the XM4's because they lost the package I sent them in for repair haha. Thinking of buying the 5's now but I need to know the firmware also isn't fucked up
2024-08-09,"From my experience, all sony ANC headphones start with ANC on after powering up, no matter what you had previously been using."
2024-08-09,I would love to have more context like why...
2024-08-09,Same man😂
2024-08-09,Most likely mid 2025. They have a two year cycle for headphones.
2024-12-03,Both have draining issues lmaooo
2024-08-28,"Depends on the use case - if you want to walk/jog/etc. then the earbuds. The headphones are not even sweat-proof, let alone waterproof. 

However, the sound, the ANC, etc. are all better in the headphones. 

So, for me, if I had to have only one, I'd pick the earbuds but there's no doubt in my mind, that the headphones are the superior product overall."
2024-08-11,Nope. I've never heard distortion with volume
2024-08-14,"Yes. They distort at 11 frequencies across the hearing range of humans. (I tested them.) The issue is that the XM5s don't play well with the SBC codec, and that is their default codec. 🤷‍♂️ However, the XM5s are stunning when they are used with Sony's LDAC codec. (The first thing you must do is make sure your phone supports the LDAC codec. Just google it.) 

When I first received the buds, 8 days ago, I went through a huge hassle to learn this and learn how to address the issue. I wrote a Reddit ""essay"" about how to fix the problem. I think you can find it if you click my username. (I'm also new to Reddit. I'm not sure, but I wrote the post in the SonyHeadphones group.) In the end, the fix is easy to implement but completely arcane. 

If your phone does not support the LDAC codec but supports a codec called aptX HD, find a pair of buds that support that codec. Lots of them are out there."
2024-08-11,"For $140, it's fully worth that price. ANC is one of the best in the market and the overall sound quality is what I enjoy the most. I don't think the bass is super amazing but it's the least of my worries and there is a clear bass slider on the app for people who need more bass. I would hope the earbuds last at least 2-3 years based on people saying the XM4s have lasted that long and they last around 8 hours on a single charge"
2024-08-09,Wait.. isnt the xm5 supposed to be the more comfy one
2024-08-12,"No the XM5's sound quality is definitely better, when you don't have external factors affecting your hearing of it

Personal opinion would prefer slightly worse sound but have less background noise"
2024-08-09,It’s sarcasm…
2024-08-10,Can’t believe I confused this post with WH-1000XM5 smh
2024-08-11,Thank you so much for replying. Yeah I was doing a Lil bit of research and came to know that EQ in Sony app helps a lot in delivering the music in a way we need it to. The fact about XM4 is convincing cause I see people suggesting it still. I would most use the buds in public transport and I hate the traffic noise recently due to increase in use of the route due to developments. it's about 3-4 hours to and from. So yeah ANC is my most looked up feature which i believe from your comments and majority of others is top notch. Thanks again man. Ive ordered it just now.
2024-08-09,"Ear dependent I guess, XM3s are much bulkier and more likely to fall out but I still found them comfier"
2024-08-09,Oke
2024-03-30,The main issue is foam tips life time

2024-03-30,I saw the xm5 in person and decided not to go with them.They reminded me of the old  Samsung earbuds. They feel very slippery and too small. I am getting the Sennheiser momentum 4. They are supposed to sound better.
2024-03-30,"I appreciate in them microphone, cuts out washing, cooking, vacuuming"
2024-03-31,"I like the size of the XM5 and the sound is slightly improved but with good tips I do think the XM4 are louder and sound better. 
I wish I never bought the XM5 but it’s done. They do sound slightly more engaging - but it’s a preferential thing. I find the XM4 to be a sennheiser style sound signature and the 5 is trying to progress from that. 

So I like having both but given my collection it’s pointless.

Now if you are talking WH models I would recommend the 5 every day over the 4."
2024-03-31,"Had the wf xm5 and returned them to amazon the same day! Slippery little pebbles with crappy sponge tips.
Bose ultra earbuds anc is stunning, Sony xm5 doesn't come close."
2024-03-31,"The look of the XM5s makes me think that they will be similar to the Galaxy Buds 2 that I got with my phone, an awkward, slippy annoyance. The XM4 is a little bulky but I prefer that instead of fumbling around with small slippy buds. 

I love the sound from my XM4s but I can't use noise cancelling or ambient modes anymore because of a loud annoying wind type sound in the left earbud that not only is distracting but after a while kind of disorienting. Conveniently they were out of warranty before this issue cropped up. The right earbud doesn't seem to charge fully either anymore. 

I'm thinking of going with Sennheiser or Bose instead."
2024-04-01,"Compared to the xm4s, yes definitely worth and better."
2024-04-02,Keep the XM4 buds and get XM5 over the ears. Best of both worlds.
2024-04-03,"They are pretty much the same as the xm4 just smaller and cause of that more.comfortable. so just but them a New pair of batteries, if you dont want that maybe try the bose ultra"
2024-03-30,Bose quietcomfort ultra
2024-03-30,"The noise cancelling is very weak on them, though the sound is very good.  If ANC is a big priority for you I would consider alternatives before pulling the trigger."
2024-04-02,That's a good choice but I'm not spending that much money.
2024-03-31,Of course that a pair of headphones would garner better results.
2024-05-25,are you facing any connection issues with the bose?
2024-04-02,If I could I would. I have to send them back due to a warranty claim. They are going to refund me the money and I get to buy whatever else I want
2024-04-02,I have been watching a few videos and they'll tend to say that they're good but they are not the best. I saw them in the store and I did not care for the look of them.
2024-03-31,"Are they best?
I see one comparision on wf1000xm5 vs Realme buds 5 Air pro. Are this is same? Sorry for my bad english."
2024-03-31,"I did pull the trigger because they were on sale just in case. 
But they are going back. I ended up with the momentum 4. I also saw the Technics EAH-AZ80 but did not choose them because the M4  were newer."
2024-03-31,No it’s not
2025-02-28,😂😂
2024-05-25,"Yes mate, I tolerated the ultra earbuds for about a week and then I just couldn't stand it anymore.

Bluetooth disconnecting all the time and the app, well that was messing with the bluetooth and the only time it was reasonably stable was when I deleted the app!

£300!! Simply not good enough, returned.

Got the qc45 and they have been faultless and no problem with the app at all? But the buds just don't have it.

I bought the Samsung buds FE for £65 and they have been astonishing, really excellent buds and less than a quarter of the price!

Sort it out Bose!"
2024-03-31,"Check the rtings measurements, ANC on vs off is only 6 DB difference, or just test it yourself."
2024-05-26,So they work only if you don't have the app? Then delete the app after setting the earbuds up? What am I missing?
2024-05-26,"Basically the app if you use it keeps disconnecting from the buds and then keeps trying to reconnect and this causes the bluetooth dropouts, even if it's in your ""recents apps"", so the best thing you can do is connect to the app, set everything thing up and then close the app and remove from your recents so it's not running in the background.

Another thing I experienced twice in the week I had them was the bluetooth disconnecting when the bud batteries dropped to 50%! Weird thing, but what was worse is the fact that I hadn't taken the case out with me (I never need the case with my other buds), so I was in Morrisons trying to reconnect to my phone but no fking chance mate, you have to put them back in the case and start the process over to reconnect.

Oh and not forgetting that you will be stuck with sbc or aac unless you have the specific aptx ADAPTIVE, not many phones have the latest adaptive version, so check your Bluetooth codecs before you buy!?

Biggest disappointment I've had, but you might get on better than me? Good luck..."
2024-05-26,Thanks for helping out. It's either these or the Airpods Pro 2nd gen. My need is mostly ANC with at least average audio quality. I don't need these during travels/exercises. I will connect them to my Macbook and won't move more than 9 feet from the laptop.
2024-05-26,"Take the airpods mate, you'll have an excellent connection with your mac, I sincerely wanted to love the ultra, but it was just sooooo irritating.

I might try them again in a year or two if they manage to sort out the problems? ✌️"
2023-07-29,"Very thorough review, thanks for taking the time to share. Not likely to replace my APP2 any time soon but good to see Sony is steadily improving. Something about APP is almost intangible, as cringey as it is to say they have an ""it"" factor of just being effortless to use that I've never got from another TWS."
2023-07-29,"This was a great read and much more helpful than all of the ""the best just got better"" consumer electronics reviews out there. Thanks for sharing!"
2023-07-29,Can you provide some details on call quality over the phone or conference calls via teams?
2023-09-04,[deleted]
2023-11-29,"These earbuds are horribly overrated. Sound lags AP Pro 2s, definitely a volume issue, call quality is good as is ANC but definitely no better than AP Pro 2s. Best sound & ANC are Bose but they have connectivity issues & call quality is garbage. Stick with AP Pro 2s if using iPhone/IOS."
2023-07-29,"Thanks for the info. I have the previous generation and I'm probably just going to stick with them.

As you can probably tell I don't really use them from music listing but more for travel and for listening to podcasts and TV and stuff"
2023-07-29,"Spatial audio for me is something that will keep me from going to other brands. It’s just so addictive and immersive with the right tracks. Even using the stereo upmix creates a sense of depth especially in the low end, like it manages to split bass into layers and I’ve never tried anything like that on a TWS before."
2023-07-29,"It looks like they fixed the upper mids/treble, the XM4 are too dark there. XM5 have similar bass profile but more upper mids/treble which would take away that muffle and add clarity. They are still mid-bassy but you can just drop that a touch in the EQ in the app, dropping the first 400Hz by even 1-2dB helps with that. My XM4, -1dB is enough, some of them seem to measure bassier and you might want 2. It's a small change but it removes all the bass bloom/boom for me.

Comparison:

https://www.soundguys.com/sony-wf-1000xm5-vs-sony-wf-1000xm4-96068/#id-sound-quality-96068"
2023-07-29,How’s the fit vs air pods pro? I have a pair of air pods pro and I can’t get them to stay in my ear or make a good seal. I’ve tried two sets of third party tips as well. No luck. I’m considering shifting to XM5 just based on fit. I’m an iPhone user and considering leaving the ecosystem cos I truly can’t get them to stay in my ear. They literally go flying out when I lie down or have the slightest sweat in my ear (riding a bike)
2023-07-29,"I was excited about these, as I’m kind of sour on my AirPods Pro due to rattling noise that came *just* after warranty expired, but it does seem like there’s virtually no difference and, if you’re invested in the Apple ecosystem like I am, the advantage goes to AirPods Pro 2. Maybe I’ll just upgrade them to the new version anyway. I like virtually everything else about them, and like you say, the integration with iOS has a lot of value. 

The Sonys *look cooler* though… :)"
2023-08-01,The EQ selector gimmick in the app for this is absolutely phenomenal. You put on a few of your favorite songs and you can just play with what sounds the best to you. It goes through several iterations and the final EQ settings are pretty dang good. I wouldn’t even bother with any of the presets.
2023-08-06,"How much better are the pro 2 to pro 1, I have pro ones and just ordered these buds thinking they were significantly better than my pro 1s…."
2023-08-06,"So my XM4's are broken and I was about to send for repair, should I bother or just buy the new one? Especially when they said it's gonna set me back like ~160"
2023-09-27,"I had the xm4s which i just lost, would you recomend the xm5 as an uograde from the xm4?"
2023-10-30,"currently, im using wfxm5 with ANC on most of the time. However, I do noticed there isnt much difference when I turned off the ANC.   
So is it  
a: passive NC is doing the most of the NC that turning off NC didnt make a difference  
b: ANC is still on even though i manually turned off ANC  
let me know which one is more accurate."
2023-11-30,I stumbled upon your review and I’m surprised that anc is equal to AirPods since it’s in ear. I would have thought that anc was way better with Sony because of the design. How good is the anc? Like does it actually cancel out side or just make it less noisy? I’ve tried other anc devices and have been quite disappointed
2023-12-18,"I want to buy those,do you recommend them ? And they are now €250"
2023-07-29,"Happy to, and I totally understand. I always have to remember most people aren't like me and a lot of folks in this forum that have huge collections lol. I think Sony may find themselves in an odd position as they ecosystem starts sort of locking people in as well - AirPods w/ Apple, Galaxy Buds, Google's products, etc. It really is a huge pain to use features on the XM5s that ""just work"" w/ AirPods. And IMO, the sound isn't hugely different enough to justify the effort or cost to switch."
2023-07-29,Haha appreciate it! 🙏🏾
2023-07-29,"Haven’t had the chance to use them on a call yet, but once I do will see what I find out."
2023-09-05,"Not sure your points of comparison, but in terms of ANC performance in the $200-300 category, AP2 is consistently reviewed among the best - usually somewhere in the top between Bose, Apple and Sony. 

Not saying your personal experience with the AP2 isn’t as you say, just for the benefit of those using this post for research, the AP2 are not what most would call bad when it comes to ANC or overall sound quality."
2023-07-29,"I’m mixed on spatial audio. I find it pretty headphone/bud dependent. I do think it improves AirPods (both Pro and Max), but I find it less impressive on buds that already have good stage and imaging. 

I can’t get with the specialized stereo except for podcasts."
2023-07-29,"I didn’t have the 4s so couldn’t compare first hand. That Sound Guys FR graph is actually what pushed me over the edge to give these a try, and it worked out well. Totally agree there’s a mid bass bump, but compared to a lot of what is out there for mainstream/consumer buds, I wouldn’t call these bassy. And even the treble tuning isn’t really so aggressive or mids so far back to call these v-shaped. These may even actually become my go-go consumer buds for mid-focused listening. 

On the EQ, the app isn’t great. To your point, it doesn’t let you adjust by frequency until 400Hz, which is really lower mids. It piles all the bass frequencies together with the “clear bass” slider, which is bit annoying, but luckily the tune out of the box works for me 🙂"
2023-07-29,"So, I would call the fit good but not great for working out. Similar to you, my AirPods are the worst in terms of stability of all of the buds I own. They create a seal, but I would call it more of a “gentle sit in your ear seal”. 

The XM5s are definitely a bit more firm, partially because the tips are foam versus silicone/rubber, and they go slightly deeper into the ear. They definitely stay in my ears better than the AirPods. I can dance around in them no issue. 

However, I still would not say they are great for working out, and for this, the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 are the better choice. This is because along with multiple tips, they also include wings to provide stability against the back part of your ear. They are my primary workout buds. Definitely not a sacrifice in terms of sound quality (arguably better), though the ANC isn’t quite as good, and you may have to EQ the bass down a bit and mids up, which is easy to do in the app and works well."
2023-07-29,"Yeah the only real audio difference is a bit of a better technical performance on the soundstage front. It’s a bit more 3 dimensional than the AirPods, which I find pretty flat. That said, unless you’re really into that kinda listing, it’s a tough trade off. It isn’t huge night and day."
2023-08-06,"The AP2 are better than the AP1. What is immediately noticeable is the more defined low end. The stage is also a bit wider, and ensure just overall a cleaner sound. Incremental improvement but there.

If you’re saying you ordered the XM5s to replace the AP1, on sound alone, the XM5s are far better."
2023-08-07,"That's my main concern while buying a Sony product, Sony's hardware just gives up after some time. 
Can you please tell how much time you used your XM4 before they broke. (and what happened to them now?)"
2023-08-09,"me too haha! but mine was because my dog thought one of the earbuds were a chew toy since I sometimes use them to help me sleep, and one of them fell out."
2023-09-27,"I would say more refinement than upgrade. Certainly better, but whether that’s worth the cost difference between the older model, tougher call depending on what features you value most. The sound and performance itself is largely the same with more upper range presence than the XM4s, which are tuned quite dark."
2023-10-30,"It is active noise cancellation, and there should be a noticeable difference when ANC is on vs. off. Make sure to double check in the app under sound that you have “noise canceling” selected. If that doesn’t work, probably need to return and replace."
2023-11-30,"It’s in-ear but not deep in-ear like an IEM, so the active noise cancellation still has to do a lot of work. 

I would rank noise cancellation among bids brands as Bose > Apple >= Sony. But the difference between the three of them is only maybe 10%. 

With all three, you can sit with nothing playing, turn on ANC and block out 80%+ of the sound I’d say (not scientific of course). But whether you can get to 100% depends on what the outside noise is. ANC is designed to block out really low rumbles and high noise frequencies. That’s why stuff like voices always sneaks in a bit, but an airplane can be totally silent."
2023-07-29,"I’m very much out of the loop regarding TWS. What features would I lose out if I switched over from AirPods?

The only thing I can think of is easy switching among other Apple gear."
2023-07-29,"Sure, I'm just saying with the XM4, it's really that slight lack of pinna gain that is the only problem with them, so it looks like a big improvement in the XM5, they are basically doing stock more or less what I EQ them up to.

And then just that if you do feel the mid-bass is a *little* too much, -1 or -2dB at 400Hz really cleans it up a lot. I get that the 400Hz is limiting but it has a Q either side and I find this one effectively brings down the mid-bass and the bleed into the lower mids. I actually go -1 at 400 and +1 on the ""Clear Bass"", this gives a very effective cut in the mid-bass while leaving the sub-bass about where it was.

This is what I end up with (actual measurement):

One other thing to note, the FR on these varies by volume. So this is 50% which is around where I listen, it's not the same at other volumes."
2023-07-29,Thanks for letting me know and the recommendation. I’m not sure if I’m looking for purely workout buds. I just wanted something tactically fit in my ear Vs the AirPods Pro. I think I’ll trial the XM5. You are right the AirPods mostly just kind of sit in the ear lol
2023-08-06,"Dont care about the sound, I care about ANC. I got a new job and I work in a loud open office and I need to block out people talking around me.   


The AP1 do not do a good job at all."
2023-08-09,It gave up after around 1 year. I just have them on my desk now lol
2023-09-27,My xm4 are still missing but i think i can get refermed xm4 for like 190 .. vs 290 xm5 new. Maybe itll go on sale
2023-07-29,"If you’re in Apple devices…

Automatic connection switching between your devices. XM5s only support two connections, so if you’re like me and have a phone, tablet, computer, TV, etc., then you’re constantly repairing across devices. 

Spatial audio (including personalized for your ears and head tracking) that is embedded in the OS, so it works with only a couple of clicks. With the XM5s you have to enable a bunch of stuff in the Sony app (which requires signing up for an account), then turning on the setting in individual apps. Also iOS only supports spatial audio for video with AirPods and a Beats, so for video you simply won’t have the option. 

Transparency mode that automatically blocks out loud noises. XM5s don’t have this. ANC mode that automatically lets in voices (coming in iOS 17).  XM5s have this but it is imbedded within the app settings. 

Just in general, everything has to be done within the app instead of right on your system. Even checking the battery level of the case is a minor inconvenience lol. Us spoiled Apple people lol 

It’s nothing that makes them not usable - I still will be using these a lot, but that’s because I’m a headphone geek and am used to having tons of different devices for the sake of sound and even plugging in portable DACs and such. I can imagine folks absolutely never leaving the convenience of AirPods - that’s why Apple does it.

Edit: also would be giving up hands free “hey siri” and automatic text message dictation and response"
2023-09-05,"I own the AP2, APMax, Sennheiser TW3, 1000XM5, Montblanc MTB 03 - and the XM5 and AP2 are noticeably the best and very close in quality - on this day with all latest firmware updates. 

*The APMax I would say is better than all but isn’t a fair comparison because they are over ear."
2023-07-29,"Yeah I’m with you. I also get why Sony (and Apple with the AirPods as well) adjust EQ by volume, but annoying for us tinkers lol. At least give and option to turn it off."
2023-07-29,"Yeah, great for comfort, meh for moving around lol"
2023-08-06,"Ah, the ANC on the 2 is very much improved. However, what you’re trying to do in general (block out voices) is very tough for all devices in general. 

If you think about how ANC works, in simple terms, it hears what’s around you and blasts opposing frequencies into your ears to cancel out the noise. This is though to do for vocal frequencies because it’s the same area of the frequency spectrum that’s important for music. That’s why ANC is better at low rumbles (planes, HVACs,) and high pitched frequencies. I’ve yet to come across any device that can block out people while nothing is playing. However, you can turn on some background sounds even at low volume (built into iOS - rainfall, waterfall, etc.), and that helps a ton."
2023-08-30,">back part of your ear. They are my primary workout buds. Definitely not a sacrifice in terms of sound qualit

my XM3's did the same.. now I always buy from John Lewis in the UK as they have a 2 year warranty!"
2023-07-29,"Thanks for the explanation.

After owning my Gen 1 AirPods Pro, I can easily say that I've paid for the convenience than the sound. They're really easy to use when you're out and about, and you can check all the details at a glance. It helps that the sound is good enough."
2023-07-29,I just what something that stays in my ear when I lie down 🫠
2023-08-06,"Thanks for educating me. That all makes a lot of sense.   


I already paid for shipping and they are coming tmrw. However, do you think I will notice a big difference from AP1 and XM5 for noise cancelation?  


  
How much better are the over ear XM5 at ANC compared to the XM5 Buds?"
2023-10-16,What about amazon? Are they not offering 2 years warranty as well?
2023-08-06,"Check out the Gen 2s. Huge noticeable improvement in every category. The sound is also way better. Heck according to the reviewers you have to go $150+ in iems for better sound than the Pro 2s. 

The biggest difference to me though is how it no longer has that cabin pressure feeling in your head when you turn on ANC, which I have yet to see any other brand improve to this level."
2023-07-29,These at least have a shot. No promises tho lol
2023-08-06,"Definite yes. The XM5s are IMO top 3 in the market at this range between them, AP2 and Bose."
2023-08-06,"I appreciate the recommendation but I am satisfied enough with the Gen 1, and I dunno whether I see $250’s worth in APP2 **based on my circumstances.**

I get that the APP has a lot of tech. I love that you can switch between passthrough audio and ANC in the span of 2-3 seconds; I do this when I transition between public transit and walking outdoors. Wireless is convenient, too - nothing to tangle or yank. 

But there are two factors I’ve encountered that make me hesitate to upgrade. Firstly, when I am out of my home, sound quality automatically takes a hit because of the environmental noises. That can’t be helped unless I wear Etymotics, but those isolate too well and take away situational awareness. 

Secondly, wireless interference is a thing. I don’t own a car so I take public transit when going to places. When the bus or train is packed, especially during rush hour, I notice a fair bit of audio clipping. 

So yeah. I got lucky with the APP1 because I had a gift card, so I got them for much cheaper than MSRP. Now that I would need to pay MSRP…"
2023-08-06,"I will report back my own results in a couple days. Will compare AP1 to XM5.  


Really hoping I fnd they are a lot better. $300 is a lot for buds"
2023-08-06,"Understandable. Everyone has different preferences at the end of the day. 

I own both the old and new Gens. Just sharing my experience regarding both.

Interesting you say that you have wireless connection issues since I also used mine(1st Gen) in packed buses and never had any sort of clipping or other issue. Maybe check with Apple? 

And about environment noises affecting sound quality, its almost fixed in the newer ones because of better ANC. The transparency mode also now reduces loud noises on its own."
2023-08-06,"It's good to hear that there have been improvements in the newer generation. 

> Interesting you say that you have wireless connection issues since I also used mine(1st Gen) in packed buses and never had any sort of clipping or other issue. Maybe check with Apple? 

I should have made this clearer. The next time you ride, can you look at how many people wear wireless buds? Here in Korea, wireless buds and headphones are every-frigging-where, so during rush hour, the density grows. My unfounded theory is that all the wearers listening at the same time end up causing interference."
2024-03-09,"I’m not kidding when I say I wear the Sony xm5 without taking it off for periods of up to 12 hours, on a daily basis, without experience discomfort or overheating or anything. The battery life is amazing, light weight build, love the sound quality and noise canceling, just get them bro

EDIT: I thought you were asking about WH 1000XM5"
2024-03-09,I had 2 sets and returned both. The issue I had was when noise canceling was active they would buzz or crackle meaning I could only use them with anc off. I didnt have any issues with battery. The tips are bad and I had to purchase foam tips to get a better seal. Build quality feels cheap and plasticy. Id say try something else but I know options are limited. Currently on second set of Bose Ultras.
2024-03-09,"I have them and they're incredible. Amazing sound quality that's not far off my wired over ear headphones. Noise cancellation is great, works amazingly on planes too and got me through 24 hours of flying with occasional breaks to charge. Pairing with the android app is incredibly easy and I can switch them seamlessly between my phone, laptop, mp3 player and switch. LDAC works great, on the ""prioritise sound quality rather than connection"" setting you get very occasional drops that barely interfere with use, I go running in them and can leave my phone in one room and go to the next with an uninterrupted connection even in the high sound quality setting. No issues with the battery and I haven't seen that many others with the 5s having battery issues yet either.

Honestly, they're amazing and I would 100% recommend."
2024-03-09,Don't. Mine stopped working after 3 months. Service was also declined and I am regretting every bit of it.
2024-03-09,"When are they announcing XM6, cause I am currently looking at the Bose quit comfort hearing some good things."
2024-03-10,I love mine.
2024-03-10,Personally I got the linkbuds s for under half the price (sale). And they only perform a few % under in sound quality. But I do use AAC and anc off for battery time.
2024-03-13,"I've been using them for about a week now and will say above all the sound quality and anc takes the cake by a mile, don't buy them for quality of life improvements though. Out of the box they sound lifeless, mess with the in app eq and they're the best sounding earbuds I've ever tried. I'm one of those people who has purchased and returned buds from many different manufacturers. 

I'm not an audiophile but I can comfortably say my ears are trained to distinguish high quality from crap and mediocre. I've spent a lot of time messing with the eq on these and have found the perfect setting (for me). I listen to a wide variety of music genres and they all sound great with these. 

I mentioned not buying these for quality of life improvements because outside of anc and sound quality these will honestly piss you off. The mics suck, google assistant integration is astonishingly bad (probably because of the crap mic) and the touch controls are annoying. ""Hey google"" voice recognition 8 out of 10 will not work with these properly unless you're in a quiet environment. By quiet I mean you're alone with no noises going on around you. This is actually my 3rd pair and they all reproduced the same annoying issue. When you do manage to get google to work via your voice or by holding on the appropriate bud it'll constantly get mixed up with what you're trying to say. For example I'll say ""send wife a message"" instead google will respond with ""which Mike from your contacts do you want to message?"" Or I'll tell google to play music by a specific artist or specific song and it will play something completely different. Performing the same actions with my phone mic works damn near 100% of the time. I'm not sure why Sony can't get their damn mics right but for buds that cost $300 it's absolutely unacceptable. I've used $30 earbuds that perform better.

The touch controls are annoying because skipping tracks or going back 8 out of 10 will pause the next or previous song instead of it playing automatically. So pressing twice to skip actually becomes pressing 3 times and going back to previous becomes 4 taps instead of 3. OR when it does work properly you're already so used to it malfunctioning that you yourself pause the next or previous track. I know that's a small issue but it's annoying after a while. 

I've seen a lot of issues from folks in terms of the fit but I've personally never had these fall out once. Vigorous head shaking, unusually large joker like smiling held in place for extended periods of time, chewing, talking, nothing makes them budge. The foam eartips at first will hurt if you're used to silicone tips. This sounds gross but once your preferred sizes become slightly saturated with wax they'll feel very comfortable. So in other words they require a slight break-in period. These foam tips also don't function the same as earplugs that protect your hearing for example. Those plugs usually take a long time to revert back to their normal size. It seems the stock Sony ones are meant to just shove in your ear as they revert back to their normal size in a split second. Other foam eartips function similarly to earplugs.

Looking past the annoying issues I say buy them."
2024-03-13,"yes, uncomfortable at first but youll get used to it"
2024-03-09,"So many different opinions,why some people hate them and some say that they are perfect?

I need to think..."
2024-03-09,"Thanks man, right now i have Pixel buds pro.The sound is meh but at least they work well,and I want really good earbuds to replace them."
2024-03-10,"What is your experience with hinges.? , I've read many comments that they are fragile and break....

I need earphones/ headphones but I am currently waiting for the expected latest product launch by this year . ( Air pods pro 3 or xm6 )
Can you give me your opinion for the above."
2024-03-09,How long do you use them?
2024-03-09,Well I live in Russia and service will not help me anyway. I just can't understand why some people have this problem and other don't.
2024-03-13,And what about battery?
2024-03-09,Sorry I have no idea about the in-ear earbuds I only know about the over ear xm5
2024-03-09,7 or 8 months so far.
2024-03-13,im using it for a month already and battery can last up to 8 hrs straight
2024-03-09,"Wait,are you taking about wf-1000xm4 or wh-1000xm4?"
2024-08-23,"I've got WF-1000XM4's and the right earbud battery has hit a major wall.  The right bud only lasts 45 minutes now and the left about 2.5 hours.  Curious to hear how the battery life is on your XM5's now that you're 12-13 months into the life of the headphone.

I'll probably be getting the XM5's regardless, but would like to know if users are experiencing any issues with the battery life."
2024-03-10,Hes talking about the WH-1000XM5s
2024-08-23,"Still not noticeably any worse than the day I got them, absolutely no issues at all with them for me."
2024-10-24,"On the wfxm4 u can try to downgrade the firmware using mdr proxy to fix the issue i tried with mine and It completely fixed it, sold it on eBay and bought the wfxm5"
2024-10-24,"So I read other posts (here or elsewhere, can't remember now), from others who called Sony and were approved to open a ticket.  Because it was such a widespread known issue, and a direct result of Sony's own firmware bricking the battery, other users were able to get their earbuds refurbed despite being outside the warranty period.  So I did that, Sony provided a shipping label, I mailed them in, and when I got them back, they've been working great again.

I did end up buying the XM5 because I needed earbuds for a half marathon I was running, and my XM4's weren't going to get back to me in time.  To be honest, I like the XM4's better.  They're bigger and so they fit more securely in my ear.  The plastic is also more rubbery which makes them easier to take out of the case.  And lastly I have no connectivity issues whereas the XM5's will cut out for a fraction of a second every so often.  The XM5's are too smooth and it takes some adjusting to get them out of their case, though sound quality and battery life are probably improved.

Whatever the case, I now have two which is great because I can use one as a back-up or something."
