2024-03-30,HTC was kind of... almost there with the Elite. Fun seeing some VR content from you!
2024-03-30,Please keep doing VR content. I love VR. No one really talks about or does benchmarks for PC minimum or rational specs with VR as a main driver.
2024-03-30,"When you guys do reviews of these vr headsets I’d like to see you do it as a round table between the three of you, or at least Jay and Phil, so you get more than one head’s perspective on fit and comfort. Looking forward to Phil’s stand-alone though."
2024-03-30,Quick note on the adjustable eye pieces for people with eye prescriptions: this can't work for you if you have astigmatism. You will still need to wear either glasses or some kind of prescription insert- if this headset can even acomodate that.
2024-03-30,"I've never seen Phil look more like a ""minion"" than when he put the housing on his face."
2024-03-30,"I don't have an XR Elite but I do have the Quest Pro. I absolutely love this headset, my seventh HMD and feels like a massive upgrade over everything else I've ever used. I have a top strap from Creative Studioform that really enhances the comfort for me, out of the box it presses on my forehead a lot."
2024-03-30,Bruh this Corsair ad. They better release it before I switch to Lian Li.
2024-03-30,I'm still surprised that everyone doesn't love VR as much as I do. It's nothing short of the ability to go on a mini-vacation anytime you want. It's crazy.
2024-03-30,Interesting point. The biggest drawback for people getting into vr is always the price just for it to increase in price with each iteration of vr. Somewhat like gatekeeping or running away from a potential audience/demographics
2024-10-01,When you said I'm looking forward to the day this is VR and held up your glasses. I am with you my friend in that boat.
2024-03-30,I feel like Jay should look into the BigScreen Beyond headset. Seems like it would be the perfect option for his personal racing rig at least.
2024-03-30,"I pre-ordered a Pimax Crystal. I am more confident in that offering, especially for racing sims, trucking sims, and flight sims."
2024-03-30,"I've been very happy with my HP Reverb G2 for racing and flight sims for a long time now. It has a high resolution and good image quality and doesn't break the bank either. Sure, it isn't wireless, but for sims that isn't really important anyway as you remain stationary/sitting and use racing wheels/HOTAS etc.."
2024-03-30,"The Pro and XR Elite, are headsets made for the non-existent (or barely if there is) ""Commercial use"", which also explains why the price only goes up.
Headsets like THESE are why i think people say VR is dead or dying, because the Cooperates all try to force EVERYTHING to Commercial use, which no one wants.
Because of this, the headsets fall flat on the people who actually use VR headsets.
At least that's how I've seen it with the lil I hear or what-not, and its the Impression I have."
2024-03-30,I really like that you review VR tech on your channel. It is still kind of a niche but hopefully will become more and more interesting for all gamers in the near future
2024-03-30,"Hey guys, I run a VR Arcade and we have 22 of the Vive Focus 3 which use the exact same controllers and can tell you they can take a bit of a beating, customers don't hit the wall all the time but they do once in a while and after a year of using them we haven't lost a single one. So I can confidently say kid resistant!

Got 3 of the XR Elites and didn't see the fluff though, I think it's packaging, they mention on there using a lot of recycled stuff which does that often.

The XR elite is an amazing headset, but there are some issues with the lenses quality, I feel like the Focus 3 was MUCH better value for money."
2024-03-30,Just wanted add that VR is really important for seated simulations like driving and flying sims. I use VR exclusively for Digital Combat Simulator (DCS) and it's utterly amazing for that title (and things like MSFS 2020).
2024-03-30,That Corsair ad is exactly what the far side of my tower looks like. Thank goodness for hard drives on a chip.
2024-03-30,"Honestly the worst part of VR for me was having to give it up because the headset belongs to my daughter and she needed it back.. I know Phil will agree with me when I say it makes a big difference to Elite Dangerous gameplay. I also miss playing with my Wall-E esque training robot, the butterflies in STEAM VR, my personal virtual workplace penthouse suite and having my own huge personal cinema.. :("
2024-03-30,Dial to setup lenses to prescription is a cool feature. I hope everyone will do this for VR headsets
2024-03-30,I love my Quest Pro! The inside  out tracking on the controllers is a game changer. Only drawback I have at the moment is the headset doesn't  see the controllers anymore since the latest firmware update. Hopefully they get it fixed soon.
2024-03-30,"For people experienced with VR light blockers are not a big issue, there is a reason most Quest Pro users don't use light blockers"
2024-03-30,"If you want an amazing, non-racing VR experience, get Half-life: Alyx. The main game is amazing and engaging with immersive mechanics. For example, covering your mouth to prevent you from coughing and attracting a certain enemy. But all the free workshop campaigns are also amazing. From mini golf to a John Wick simulator, all built on the same game engine."
2024-03-30,"Regarding the headset not fitting your face - perhaps giving the beyond vr headset a try would give you a good comparison as to what's ""possible"" and what's ""reasonable"" for personalized vs mass consumer hardware."
2024-03-30,Quest Pro Stereo-accurate '3D reconstructed 'passthrough is made primarily for overlaying 3D virtual objects. It's probably the most robust standalone mixed reality device out right now.
2024-03-30,"I have a HP Reverb G2 that I use for DCS.  The biggest problem I have is I also have an LG C2 42"" OLED as a monitor - and the VR headsets never look as good.  So while the immersion and feeling of VR flying is pretty great, the flat monitor just looks so much better.  I'm just waiting for the day of an affordable VR headset that can look as good as my OLED."
2024-03-30,"Jay: ""I only wear glasses because it looks good on camera""...."
2024-03-30,Just bought a Corsair 5000D airflow. I want this cable management thing announced already to see if it’ll actually help my new build.
2024-03-30,"I can't even justify the cost of a VR headset above $400.  I use mine primarily for DCS World and a few racing sims.  My Quest 2 (with Link, of course) still gives me what I need."
2024-03-30,The intro to this video was pure gold.
2024-03-30,"I returned my Quest Pro because it was painfully uncomfortable for my head shape, so definitely your mileage may vary on that. I was spoiled by the Quest 2 and the replacement headstrap options that really increased the comfort for me."
2024-03-30,"I have a valve index, I love it but people may not love the wires but that just means you can play hours without charging. But I’m sitting in a racing sim rig and not moving around a room."
2024-03-30,Really liking the idea of easy to adjust PD as well as adjusting the lenses for a  RX script. Although to be honest I just have magnetic clip on RX lenses in my Quest 2. I also see the HTC headset as a more premium level product vs the very budget friendly Quest 2 but it'd be awesome to not have to add additional thickness to the lenses to be able to see without glasses.
2024-03-30,"Love this stuff, I had my nearly 3 year old grandson watch some VR content of fish using my quest 2. It was so cool to see him processing what he was seeing combined with still hearing me. ""Papa! fishies!!!"" Where? him pointing all over."
2024-03-30,"The VR crowd would love more VR content. I'd love some content helping me determine my next GPU update, especially to match up to headsets using the XR2 gen 2 chips and AV1 when they start coming out later this year. I'm considering AMD seriously, but I've heard so much how AMD sucks at VR. It would be great to hear your perspective on how the modern GPU's compare at streaming PCVR wireless to headsets."
2024-03-30,"Its so hard to explain how good VR is compared to flatscreen gaming to people who didn't put on a headset for an extended time yet. Its is the future of PC gaming for sure.
Id say flatscreen gaming experience is like 30% compared to VR. 
Never ever did i get so imersed in a game where the hair on my neck would stand up. But in VR my body physicaly responds to stuff hapening in the game. Its so weird."
2024-03-30,"Can't fault my Reverb G2 for now with a rtx3090. I only use it for sim racing and flight sim and I love it. I did gat a replacement face cover for increased FOV, and I use cable management pulleys, but it's good enough for what my hardware can deliver. For next gen VR it's going to be 50/60 series cards before we see massive improvements that are worth me paying for."
2024-03-30,Love the addition of vr content on the channel
2024-03-30,I was looking at this before but after everything you've said I'm so glad I went with the Pico 4 instead for like 1/3 of the price. Could literally get that and a 4070 for the price of an XR so the XR would need to have some pretty insane performance to justify the price.
2024-03-30,"""1000$ for VR is expensive"" meanwhile a phone can cost just as much if not more and everyone still buys them (some people even buy a new one every year)"
2024-03-30,Look into the bigscreen headset once it releases if your priority is lightweightedness. That thing is tiny (and far out of my budget :cry:)
2024-03-30,The adjustment for the lenses is a huge selling point!
2024-03-30,"I just got into VR with the PlayStation VR2 and loving it righr now. No motion sickness at all. 


Been a great experience"
2024-03-30,"VR content on your channel! Nice, thanks for venturing into the Immersive realm for a bit!"
2024-03-30,To me VR is the most incredible thing in years and years. It's subjective but the feeling of immersion you can get is second to none and when the experience is good there is nothing quite like it. Not only for racing sims (I could never play a racing game without VR again after seeing how amazing it is inside a headset) but for everything else too.
2024-03-30,So happy Corsair is getting rid of all the cables. I’ve been holding out on switching my fans hoping Corsair would change there design in the future and they have.
2024-03-30,"Interested to see your reaction to how the XR performs. Not heard good things from the few VR officianados who have bought them.

Please Please do a video where Phil tries to use these for VR for a week or two and gives a full review. We want to know what it is like to use as a daily driver, does it play nice with Steam VR, is the tracking and latency good etc."
2024-03-30,That dial for each eye is awesome.
2024-03-30,"The problem with this diopter adjustment is that if you look at glasses prescriptions, they are written at a quarter diopter accuracy. So if I am 3.5 in one eye and 4.5 in the other eye, no amount of diopter adjustment is going to make it clear. I'm still going to have to wear my glasses."
2024-03-30,"I was super disappointed when I first got it, but I've really warmed up to it after adjusting to it. I use it over my SteamVR headsets now. It's certainly a waste of money if you have access to a quest pro, but if it were half the price (Which is how much I got mine for), I would say it would reasonably hold up against other options. Better than a Quest 2 in my opinion if you're doing tethered PCVR. Wi-Fi streaming has a terrible latency when you turn your head fast that really needs to be fixed, but that's about the only part that's worse than Quest 2. If you have access to the Pico 4 where you live (I don't) then that's certainly the better option, superior in every category including price."
2024-03-30,I absolutely love my Vive XRE for Racing and Flying Sims. Glasses mode with power injection is so comfortable for me.
2024-03-30,"I have an Index, seems they are only now catching up to the index. Can't wait to see what valve is cooking up."
2024-03-30,i always enjoy the Workplace Banter. the genuine laughs are nice to see.
2024-03-30,"I have a Quest 2 for, mainly, iRacing. I use it ‘virtually’ () every day. It is awesome. I love it so much. I considered triple screens, but the immersion from VR is unparalleled, imo. I never suffer with motion sickness, thankfully, so that’s probably a major contributing factor. If you are considering VR and can afford it, then I can’t recommend it enough. Just wish the choice was greater and a little less expensive. The chances of prices reducing in this climate is, quite frankly, wishful thinking… such a shame. As a kid playing Jet Set Willy, or Manic Miner on a ZX Spectrum in the early 80’s, or defender on my mates 2600, I could only dream of this technology. As a 54 year old geek, I absolutely love it! 
In other words, I like VR…"
2024-03-30,"How dare you put these on and not say ""The power of the Sun in palm of my hands."""
2024-03-30,"love it when you guys cover VR, especially sim racing VR as imo its the only true next gen gaming experience out there, the immersion you get from the wheel force feedback combined with the stereoscopic 3D & headtracking is second to none & thats just entry level, im not even a car guy but the second i tried it i was hooked"
2024-03-30,"I Just realized that I apreciate you and your presence so much that I even watch Videos Im not that interested in.
Thanks for all the years of great content."
2024-03-30,Phil's laugh is always a golden moment. Such a full-hearted laugh
2024-03-30,Phil's 0 to 100 laugh in the background always gets me rolling
2024-03-30,"Personally, I'm excited for the Bigscreen Beyond headset. If small form factor is what you are looking for, well the Beyond certainly deliver on that front. Specs-wise they are also top notch, just have to wait and see how the launch goes."
2024-03-30,It's crazy that Jay regrets buying this product even though he hasn't really used it. The comfort must be horrendous for someone to regret their purchase without even turning it on.
2024-03-30,"I got a PICO4 and I really like it! So much I'll probably never buy this overpriced Vive trash again. You may want to try it too, if you don't have one yet. Didn't expect much from the PICO due to the rather low price tag but boy was I wrong. No stupid ripple lenses, stable wirless connection without additional ""antlers"" or 3rd party stuff, nearly 100% sweet spot, good FoV, can install any APK on it, works without lighthouses, has two controllers  not far behind the great Index controller, works with and without glasses, can just pop on custom made lenses and I can go on... great product and even better with some upgrades like better face panel and extra akkus. And I'm saying all this after having owned quite some VR goggles and having spend a few thousand dollars for these over the years. The PICO4 has still some issues but for me it's a far leap in the right direction and the first time I like being in VR for hours..."
2024-03-30,"I'm waiting for the day when VR will be like in ""Ready player one"" movie.....only then we can immersive ourselves, till then i go fishing on sea....."
2024-03-30,"The built in correction lenses are always spherical (myopic/hyperopic correction). If you got more than +/-6.0 dpt, you‘d have to wear glasses and same in case of astigmatism which needs cylindrical lenses for correction. This is a general problem for all optics (e.g. rifle scopes, binoculars,..). Yeah, this is sad, but for a large demographic group, this still isn‘t satisfyingly useable… btw, as I saw, the ring goes from 0-6, but it doesn‘t say if + or -? So it is only for short OR farsighted people, not both (in more sophisticated optics you get +6…0…-6 for example.) This is even worse then….let alone the very poor ergonomics of the frame…."
2024-03-30,Really well constructed video. My attention span was satisfied
2024-03-30,"We love VR, don't we folks?"
2024-03-30,"interestingly, FPV headsets for flying drones/RC planes/etc have had diopter control for a little bit now. i’m surprised it took VR manufacturers this long to do it"
2024-03-30,Can you review the Pimax headsets? Would make for a great video
2024-03-30,I like the welding goggle look quite frankly
2024-03-30,Honestly for me this is the first VR headset that I am truly interested in. I need to wear glasses be able to see so having the adjustment has me very intrigued I cannot wait for the review.
2024-03-30,"That dial for prescription lenses should be an industry standard. Paying extra for VR Wave lenses for my Quest 2 shouldn't be necessary. It doesn't account for all the factors, but its so much better than no options at all."
2024-03-30,"I’m no fan of the Vive headset, but Christ what a pointless video… what about the using the thing?"
2024-03-30,YAY! finally a youtuber thats known to not bullshit it's viewers doing VR set reviews!
2024-03-30,"The flexible rings are there to absorb impact. It's saved my g2 controllers many times. Full force hits against walls, metal and glass. I have scars and the controllers survived"
2024-03-30,"big plus is the eyesight changing ability, as someone with -7.5 glasses, its pretty much impossible to get a proper VR-headset without cramming my glasses inside"
2024-03-30,"My eyes suffer several conditions that can be summarized as ""Without my glasses,  I don't see 3 people on a donkey"""
2024-03-30,12:55 thats actually exactly how it went
2024-03-30,"Forget fire, forget the wheel. VR is the greatest gift human kind has ever given itself"
2024-03-30,"VR in my options needs to focus on much wider FOV technology that can be put into a compact headset. Make it affordable, high res and totally wireless then you have my attention. Wishful thinking I know."
2024-03-30,"6:43 jay as a bug nahhhhhh , jay with steampunk welding googles yessssss"
2024-03-30,"cool to see a big youtuber covering vr, i hope the review will be solid. 
already liked the foot notes that it does not has a displayport connection, because that's something people like to know^^"
2024-03-30,"goes into angry Jeff Bridges mode...""TONY STARK BUILT THIS IN A CAVE!!!!!!!"""
2024-03-30,"6:44 It looks like Jay's eyes are looking at two different things at each side, lmao!"
2024-03-30,"You can't say that one justs uses VR for ""racing sims"" without saying that racings sims in VR is almost life changing.... it is."
2024-03-30,"As someone who is wearing prescription eyeglasses, the feature of having an adjustable lens is great. All VR, especially the expensive ones, should have it."
2024-03-30,"If you want a VR headset that is tiny, built for comfort, custom scanned faceplate, light and hi resolution.  Check out the Bigscreen Beyond headset."
2024-03-30,"I read, ""I feel like I got ripped off ."" I saw the pic and laughed, first thing that came to mind was, and you look like you got ripped off. That was too funny lol! Had to watch the video after that lol."
2024-03-30,It's progress... sometimes one step forward and two steps back. Thanks for the analysis
2024-03-30,thank you for sizing it. cant wait for Phil's review
2024-03-30,"If you're looking for the smallest headset possible, the bigscreen beyond is the smallest currently available for order. Isn't a standalone though."
2024-03-30,"That top strap seems it would dig into the top of your head after a while, you're gonna feel that to the point it might start hurting seeing how much tension is on it. Truly an afterthought, not well thought through..."
2024-03-30,"meanwhile, I paid almost half that in Canadian funds for the Rift S, and while the refresh rate is at the minimum for VR, I find it fine. Works just as well as the HTC Vive I tried at a VR Cafe."
2024-03-30,Was never a fan of Jay but its still dope to see him doing what he loves and the establishment he created!
2024-03-30,"Face tracking, eye tracking and full body tracking on Vive XR Elite. Love it."
2024-03-30,"In past I trained on use of full face respirators and you could not use your eye glass with them as ""You need full seal""  So the respirator had some think akin to rubber O ring that you used to add a set of persecution lenses into which was on inside. The rubber ring would hold the lenses in place so all VR kit need is some thing like this and not that costly add to headset. Then all you then need to get is set of persecution lenses that are sized to fit."
2024-03-30,"8:34, looks like they snagged an idea from the orginal jurassic park."
2024-03-30,"As a gamer, I have never wanted VR, because I want to have full sensory connection with my real-world surroundings while I am playing a game."
2024-03-30,"lel dat phil wearing da housing make him insta like minions
good humour there, thumbs up man!"
2024-03-30,The fact it's not 100% hand tracking w no controllers in 2023 is crazy.
2024-03-30,"oooo nice
if those adjusters can also correct for astigmatism, that's a winner for me"
2024-03-30,I could barely afford a Quest 2. Loving it so far. F1 22 in VR is worth it
2024-03-30,I'm sticking with my Rift S until it dies entirely. Steam VR beta builds and Oculus beta updates have stabilized my VR experience for Assetto Corsa. I've also made sure that Steam is the default OpenXR software solution.
2024-03-30,"Have to agree with Jay that the top strap seems like an afterthought. Almost looks like something you'd find on a sleeping mask, especially when compared to the rest of the device."
2024-03-30,"to be fair, i remember spending 1200$ for the full settup for the first Oculus. buying extra sensors, buying the controllers, etc."
2024-03-30,"""How is anyone supposed to manage these cables?"" While you wait for Corsair to reveal what's coming, there's always LTT cable ties! :evil:
I always wondered how cool it would be if the world turned into TWD and I could kill zombies at my workplace, I guess Augmented Reality is the next best thing... when it costs less than an arm and a leg, so next decade maybe... but I completey agree with Jay, AG glasses in the form of normal glasses is definitely what I expect them to achieve someday."
2024-03-30,Possibly one of the best thumbnails on YouTube.
2024-03-30,"Why do these guys never design it to be a functional proven design. Ww2 pilot goggles, vintage motorcycle goggles, dive gear, snowboarding goggles. JayzR&D."
2024-03-30,"13:49 ""You look like a stupid scuba diver."""
2024-03-30,"I'm surprised that these companies haven't come up with a vest to wear to cut down on the weight of the headset. You could easily wear a 1lb battery on a vest and feel next to nothing. Better wireless connectivity, no need to have the issue of the wires to the PC getting in the way, etc."
2024-03-30,"And I thought buying a Quest VR headset used for $100 was a lot of money 
I love Elite Dangerous, Flight Simulator and racing games in VR."
2024-03-30,The video thumbnail made me think of those old 1950s pulp sci-fi movies.  Mad scientist or naive army goober with bug-eye goggles.
2024-03-30,"We need to have some new triple AAA games done in VR like Fallout, Tome Raider, Oblivion, Sniper Elite, Etc..."
2024-03-30,Pico 4 with an aftermarket leather face gasket is the best experience.
2024-03-30,"There are ""VR"" glasses that look like glasses, the issue with them is they are designed to be ""AR"" first and the VR sub par. the Nreal Air is an example."
2024-03-30,"BigscreenVR will be gamechanger.

Pimax crystall too seems very interesting"
2024-03-30,"While it's not perfect, I still like my Valve Index.  I have a custom face gasket for comfort.  I have custom lenses which match my prescription, so I don't have to use glasses.  And it also runs on Linux, which is my chosen main OS."
2024-03-30,The light gaurd when phil puts it on he looks like a minion
2024-03-30,"I have my eyes on bigscreen vr atm. ive not gotten my hands on it or tried it yet, but i belive it might be the vr to go for atm. i have been testing most of whats out there, so i ""think"" of the experience i have, that its worth getting. There is maby an small problem with it. its a personal vr, that you cant share with others. due its custom made for you only. by that its by face and your eye sight. but from what i see and read, it might be the best you can get for your self, and only your self. the hard part for me, is that i also like to share my experience in vr with others, so they can see and test my stuff."
2024-03-30,"At costco, my wife got me a $399 quest 2 with a carrying case and 2 controllers. 
I wouldn't buy $999 b.s. 
No base stations. Just a headset.
I play HL2VR and Re8 VR (mods). Did re4 o.g. vr and I will say, Quest 2 is fine. No issues. I play for hours on end, so I usually have a battery pack hooked up in my pocket. I am usually using SteamVR. I beat Compound, which was very fun. Fallout 4VR was great too, with mods and everything. Yeah, that's all I needed. No big expensive stuff. High price tags don't necessarily mean quality  (cough nvidia). They just mean it is expensive."
2024-03-30,"I do enjoy VR content, because I use VR. I play IL2 and is graphic heavy.    thanks Jay."
2024-03-30,"XR is the all encompassing term for VR, MR and AR. VR + AR as you described is called ""Mixed Reality"" or MR."
2024-03-30,"get the camera setup for both eyes, do a split screen, then tell us to look at the screen with crossed eyes."
2024-03-30,"Jay, you need to get ahold of someone at bigscreen, the new bigscreen VR allows prescription lenses and its way smaller and lighter, and while its only tethered, it should be perfect for your use case as a PC racer, as that is my main use for VR as well... keep the VR stuff coming, really enjoying it!"
2024-03-30,"Have you considered preording a Bigscreen Beyond? It's a SteamVR lighthouse-tracked headset, so you would need base stations + controllers (so price will be a bit higher), but it looks like it's a way more comfortable option over the XR Elite."
2024-03-30,"Reminds me of the phone holder ones we would get in at Dollar Tree for Christmas, looks just as cheap to."
2024-03-30,"If you're looking for a very small vr headset, keep an eye out for the Bigscreen Beyond."
2024-03-30,"From what I've seen most modern headsets can adjust +/-6 for people with glasses...however trying at least what the Index has, it isn't enough for someone who's well enough beyond that(8). If memory serves you trade near or distant focus."
2024-03-30,"In regards to wearing a VR Headset with Glasses I know Phills pain as I'm in the same boat. One Headset that worked really well for me and that I bought because of that is the HP Reverb G2 and I'm using a VR-Cover Facegasked on it instead of the original one. It fits basically perfectly even with my Glasses on, it's not putting any pressure on my Glasses Frame and I can easily play for hours with that Headset without any issues."
2024-03-30,Big Screen's Beyond is what I've ben looking into.
2024-03-30,I am still playing with my Valve Index every 2 days since it released. God that was a good purrchase.
2024-03-30,"Tech manufacturers are constantly evolving and re-defining the phrase ""Taking the piss"""
2024-03-30,"I sim raced VR only for 4 years & was a total VR only fan-boy (HTC Vive Pro 2018 which is awesome & I recommend 100%). I switched to 32"" curved triples a few months ago & I've never once felt like I missed it. The 'immersion' that is such a big deal is 99%  just as real in triples once you're driving but you can be in the rig for 6 hours instead of 2 hours. Same sort of spend & I guess it's nice to have the option but it'll be a long time before I go back to VR."
2024-03-30,"Comfort sure is important, even the little things becomes major as you spend hours using your VR headset.
I wish my PS VR2 would also work with PC."
2024-03-30,"Shame there isnt any PC PSVR2 drivers that work properly (yet) - its really comfy, half the price and the haptics - boy, they're amazing. Good pass-through too."
2024-03-30,big screens headset is only a grand but it's customized to one person. OLED screens and super light weight but you need your own peripherals. they also can make prescription lenses.
2024-03-30,"Please pre order the big screen one 
I spent countless hours on quest 2 and I think big screen would get it right for many aspects such as weight, comfort, screen, etc. 
the main cons is that it needs to be tethered , but it also mean battery is a non issue and you can upgrade your PC for better performance of VR instead of relying on mobile chip"
2024-03-30,"Everybody has a volume slider for their laughs and Phil's permanently stuck at 100.



Don't fix it."
2024-03-30,"It would actually be great to have small VR Tests for GPUs from you too, as there are so little of them it feels like."
2024-03-30,That megaman figure is keeping me here listening
2024-03-30,"""You look like a stoopid scuba diver"""
2024-03-30,Quest 2 playing onward with vr riffle stock
2024-03-30,"IMHO,
VR is great, but it shines in sit down sims (Flight and Racing Sims).
I have a Portable Oculus, and the games that have you walking around, you still feel kind of disconnected.

The only thing VR Needs to do is:
Pixel Density, and SubPixel Density, as well as Lens Distortions (God Rays, Blurring etc), and Comfort (Cable management, Cooling, padding etc).

Screendoor effect on most of the older and cheaper HMDs is a immersion killer."
2024-03-30,"Suggestion in terms of wearing glasses for VR.
I HIGHLY recommend getting insert prescription lenses for his headset from someone like VROptician or US ecounterpart.
It has been a game changer in terms of comfort for me plus the added bonus of no risk of scratching the lenses wearing glasses inside of the headset"
2024-03-30,"""You look like a stupid scuba diver"" LOOLLLLLL omg xD
i lost myself & busted out laughing when i heard Jay say that  so glad i hadent taken the bite out of my Sub because i woulda spit it out laughing"
2024-03-30,As a UK user of VR I run a   Vive pro2 (not that many out there) with a 4090.. I use it for MSFS  what I want to see is a Retailer a comparison between all the different Makes and Models   with the Flight sims fidelity and smoothness are king but its a wing and a prayer when you change your headset
2024-03-30,"I don't like the lense diopter asjustment personally as it doesn't allow for astigmatism. If Phil needs glasses and your sharing, get prescription lens inserts with a magnetic attachment so they can be removed and inserted easily. They will cost a little but it's so much better than any other option."
2024-03-30,"Want Jay to try on Valve Index and its controllers as a comparison (yes its not a standalone)
and for smallest amount of light bleeding = Bigscreen Beyond headset"
2024-03-30,"After spending $780 on a Vive Cosmos, I am vary wary of all thier products, thank you for this candid feedback."
2024-03-30,"VR is still in a infant stage for consumers. I feel like the Computer Industry thinks ""You don't deserve that much power."""
2024-03-30,"It should be illegal to make something more expensive but more flimsy.

I know resources are low at the moment, but there's no excuse for the amount of money just to have it during times when people could REALLY escape AND have it break easier than cheaper Sets."
2024-03-30,"""You look like a stoopid scuba diver"" Phil's face and laugh"
2024-03-30,Only problem with the prescription adjustments is when you have positive diopters instead of negative ones
2024-03-30,It's 2023.  VR should be like wearing cheap sunglasses.  You can throw them away and get a new pair at the gas station for a few bucks.  And they work perfectly.  VR and AR.
2024-03-30,"I've owned a Rift and a Quest 2. I don't feel like the technology has matured enough to bother making a third purchase for now, especially when the prices are going in the complete opposite direction to what they need to be to encourage consumer interest and market development."
2024-03-30,"To be fair, one of the reasons why the quest pro is 999 instead of the 1500 launch price is because of the xr elite announcement"
2024-03-30,Diopter adjustments is a game changer ha ha. I’ll definitely catch your review/Phils review.
2024-03-30,"There is no AR apps, no business app, no Quest pro games, no nothing for that expensive price tag and you still need to buy an expensive PC to play any AAA VR games. Go PS5 + PSVR 2. For less than $1000, you get more advanced VR technology than Quest pro + gaming PC."
2024-03-30,"The prescription correction dials might finally win me over. I wear some pretty thick glasses and no headset I've tried so far is particularly pleasant to use. All the boxes are checked here, now I just need to see the price come down."
2024-03-30,"HEY! Don't call Phill a stupid scuba diver, he does not practice scubadiving...9"
2024-03-30,"I have heard good things about the Pico headsets having great visuals and weight distribution. I have no clue why they just don't sell in north america. Either way rumor has it that the Quest3 will be announced this year, but with Zuck's move away from VR to the ""new hotness"" that is AI... who knows"
2024-03-30,"The battery shouldn't use an external cable, it should be done trough the backeting."
2024-03-30,Phil looks like one of the minions with that face gasket on! :)
2024-03-30,"If he gives up that easy on cake management,  please don't let him back in a computer case.  That was nothing mess wise."
2024-03-30,I was in the moment that you mentioned adjustment for prescription lenses....then right back out when I saw the max setting on the dial is 6.
2024-03-30,"0 to 6 with the prescription
Good thing I'm rocking a solid - 7.5"
2024-03-30,"I know you feel about capturing a VR game footage. I create VR app for client and let me tell you it's a pain when the client don't have their own headset and just proof thing via a video recording. They'll be like ""ThIs SiGn Is So SmAlL i CaN't SeE iT. WhY iS tHiS pAsS QA"", and I'll be like... dude... that sign literally almost cover my field of view in VR. I always tell them you got to proof things based on what you see in headset and rarely they listen lol. Not that they don't have the option to come into the office and use our headset."
2024-03-30,"deep down VR content is mostly adult content, gaming is still in primitive stages"
2024-03-30,Cant wait for the bigscreen beyond headset
2024-03-30,"As a PC lover, PS5 VR is really just stepping up above."
2024-03-30,"The fact that they now allow you to see your current environment to avoid hitting stuff is great, i think this might become a training tool for sports like tennis someday. (High level tennis...) People who might need to play points but hav enobody to play points against at the moment. though they would have to weigh the controller down more to simulate a racquet better."
2024-03-30,The HP Reverb G2 is still the most comfortable headset I have ever worn.
2024-03-30,"For racing and flight sims I love my Reverb G2. 3100x3100 (approx) res per eye.

Only downside is LCD and not OLED so blacks can be a bit bright for some."
2024-03-30,"If you want small and comfortable the bigscreen beyond is the best the moment. It’s only 160 grams, has a custom molded facial interface, and is the size of iphone."
2024-03-30,"I'm interested in picking up VR for sim racing, however, they have become so expensive at this point, it doesn't seem like it's worth it. I bought a PSVR for my PS4 Pro, and I loved it, but at $200-250, it was easy to love. If VR is ever going to become more viable or mainstream, it needs to be cheaper, more accessable. It's difficult to sell VR to someone that has never tried it, but when the cost is $200-300, people become more willing to try."
2024-03-30,"That last thing I want with VR is wireless. Wireless means batteries. I hate batteries. They don't last long enough, they take too long to charge, and/or the batteries wear out and the company wants you to buy a new $1000 product because the $30 battery, that they purposefully installed so as to be non user replaceable, wore out."
2024-03-30,"I still have my original VIVE. 6yrs or more since i got it. Still works great. Im looking to invest on another HTC Vive, also looking at the Valve index."
2024-03-30,i wait til the tech is far enough so that VR is implemented into lenses you can wear on your eyeball
2024-03-30,iv been waiting since you teased the first time of the new corsair thing coming as someone who has loads of corsair
2024-03-30,Wouldn't it be easier to add a setting in the software to add a prescription & alter the focus/phase. Than compensate room for glasses ️
2024-03-30,"It´s weird that nobody has made a VR headset for PCs which can be used for browsing/videos .. but using the PC only. Sort of a VR monitor, there are no in betweens, either you have to buy one you use for gaming or one of these cheap smartphone ones. Sort of a VR headset you use while sitting down watching movies."
2024-03-30,Ps5 & PSVR2 = best gaming experience I’ve ever had.
2024-03-30,I just upgraded from the HTC vive to the valve Index 2 weeks ago. this was one of my options i was thinking of grabing. but so many people still say the index is still so good for its price. and it is good
2024-03-30,Thats not a top strap is meant to go between the bits which sit on top of your ears when you've removed the rear battery part
2024-03-30,Unboxing: open box. Confirm it contains product. Remove product. Throw away box. What's the attraction?
2024-03-30,At least a big channel which has a certain knowledge of VR.
2024-03-30,"As someone who only does combat flight sims with VR (original Rift) like DCS, I’m waiting on better resolution and refresh rate along with more wide VR headsets like PiMax. 
For analogue aircraft, like the F-14, it’s hard to read the analogue gauges. 
The wide angle lense would also be closer to real life field of view and would allow me to see what’s behind me w/o breaking my neck. Right now, it’s like looking through a ski mask with blinders on both sides.

Also, some of these head sets really need active cooling. Fogging as another issue along with dealing with the inevitable sweat resulting from the headset’s heat.
Right now, TrackIR is still what I prefer using in most cases."
2024-03-30,"IF you're doing VR content, check out the Bigscreen VR. Sounds like exactly what you're looking for."
2024-03-30,As someone who works in it and deals with vr Valve index all the way haha
2024-03-30,"I don't do racing sims, I do flight sims (IL-2 pretty much exclusively, but a little War Thunder with my nephew.  Not into flying modern jets.).  Love my HP Reverb G2...with the caveat that the FoV isn't as good as it could be.  Which might be an even larger issue in racing because the boundaries are much closer and need the peripheral."
2024-03-30,"FIrst time poster, long time watcher. Jay, Love, love, love your content keep up the great work. Any who, I was just talking to my wife about taking the VR plunge, and this WAS a major contender. You just saved me some money. Thanks again for the great content."
2024-03-30,"I have not seen any comments mention it yet, but if small size and display quality are your biggest priorities, you (or anyone) should check out Bigscreen’s VR headset. 

It’s about the size of a TV remote and uses an OLED. Cheaper and 5x lighter than the Quest Pro (and uses SteamVR tracking). Some of my hardcore VR friends have gotten their early copies and say it’s a life changer for their VR experiences

It’s got its own drawbacks but choice is always a good thing! Especially with how stagnant/expensive the big players in VR have gotten"
2024-03-30,Jay looks like wall-e with that thing on
2024-03-30,"JayZ ""Don't do as I do....... do as I say""!"
2024-03-30,The valve index i feel is the best for comfort.
2024-03-30,"Video should been title, ""hi i am jay 2cents and i here to tell you how much i hate vr and olny  use it for driving sims"""
2024-03-30,it's use case. I know people who don't play 'games' in vr. they LIVE in VR. they'll sleep in their VR gear
2024-03-30,"This feels like someone designed something from shelf components. And it's not adult sized. Period. Everything about that design is either Asian market oriented, since they are on average smaller than us, or for children."
2024-03-30,"you said Phil looked like a scuba diver, my girlfriend was watching and said no more like a minion :D"
2024-03-30,"I really wanted this to be better than what it turned out to be. Also the fabric insert besides being to narrow it also has a hard plastic piece inside that is suppose to help support the headset on your face but in my experince it just felt uncomfortable even when adding the head strap. I also agree that they should have added some sort of tilt function to adjust the headset to sit better on your face because what I have found was that where I could see it the best way made it very uncomfortable but if I made of more comfortable I would not get a clear picture.

I tried the wireless PC vr and it worked pretty good but in terms of performance and clarity I would say the performance was on oar with my Quest 1 using wireless PCVR but it was a lot better quality on the quest 1 thanks to the OLED screen."
2024-03-30,Ready Player One is slowly becoming a reality.
2024-03-30,Dust is just paper fibers from the recyclable packaging. That or dandruff from the quality control tester
2024-03-30,"Point of correction,  I think you misheard when they told you what you paid for it because you responded with ""oh I paid 2k for these"".  They are 1099, not 1999, still getting very pricey"
2024-03-30,"I'm a smaller guy about 5'5"" and I picked up the vive xr elite for $780 used on bhpboto and it's super comfortable for me. I love not having to wear glasses while using it cause I'm a sweaty guy and it drips on my glasses. The fact I can just put it on and play is a big reason I bought it since I rarely used my old vr headset cause of the inconveniences of launching vr software, putting in all the wires, and not having to adjust the headset for my glasses. I do wish the fov was larger and the face cushion was a bit bigger and had stronger magnets."
2024-03-30,I have a HP G2 vr headset and love it. Lets see some game footage with this vr headset.
2024-03-30,"6:59 Jay, you like you bought a Sam Fisher costume from Aldi"
2024-03-30,psvr2 is the only one i've found truely immersed without light bleed and only limited screen door effect on the outside. htc was just frustrating to get working after multiple updates and 3 cables going back to the PC lol but yeah i'd hope for more.
2024-03-30,"Play using the controllers for a month or two, and see how you feel then. Just because they're light doesn't mean they're bad (or good). I'd rather have super-light controllers than heavy ones."
2024-03-30,"AR is the way to go. We're never going to be able to simulate reality in vr, so the logical thing to do would be to bring the virtual world to us. Kinda like cyberpunk."
2024-03-30,"I like how you need ""extra"" after market stuff from other companies for your $1100 headset"
2024-03-30,"Was hoping you would use it in this video too. I recently tried it at an event and the form factor and mixed reality was the two best features. I love the idea the headset alone weighs 270g but obviously that’s without any power/battery. Like Jay said one day you want VR to be like a pair of glasses. The cost killed my interest. I want an all in one XR headset and comfort is very subjective. The Quest Pro is known as one of the most uncomfortable/comfortable headsets in VR due to the lack of adjustability in the front pad. It can literally strangle a users forehead but I personally enjoy it. Barely use it though. Anyway, great video from you guys as always and looking forward to what Apple offers"
2024-03-30,For a thousand dollars I should not have to go to a 3rd party to buy accessories for comfort and practicality.
2024-03-30,If you wanted the smaller set should of gotten  Bigscreen Beyond new oled headset also formed for your face with 3d scan u send to them...
2024-03-30,The Quest Pro also becomes comfortable after adding a top strap. Which you need to get from third party yourself. But happy with the Pro.
2024-03-30,"15 minutes and he doesn't even test it... oh well, it was worth it just to see the Bug-eyes."
2024-03-30,"VR started as a $700+ proposition. People let the absurdly low Q2 price spoil their expectations. It was never sustainable to stuff that much tech and sheer quantity of components into something with a small form factor and expect it to keep costing less than half what your damn annual phone upgrade does.
$500 was always supposed to be the  end, $1k the Prosumer, and $3k the Industry/Rich Enthusiast rung."
2024-03-30,"I'm not wasting money on VR stuff until they get it all figured out, the technology is really good and the prices have come down because literally everyone's buying it. This niche VR market is entirely too expensive, and almost always janky in some kind of way despite the ridiculous price."
2024-03-30,My boy Jay been hitting the weights.
2024-03-30,Wife has one and I have not tried it yet. She enjoys VR but has had issues with the wireless streaming. I'm trying to talk her into upgrading from the 2070 in her machine but I really just need to install the software into mine with a 3080 to see if that would resolve the issues since the only other difference is 10 Home VS 10 Pro.  Still like my Vive Pro with first party wireless even it its clunky because Untethered wireless - However can't put that in an ITX system like I wanted to so its in a Dark Base 700 tower.
2024-03-30,You can solve the Quest Pro's light leak with a magnetic full light blocker accessory (vs the partial ones it comes with). That's an easy fix.
2024-03-30,I'd love to get into VR but until a headset comes out that is truly glasses compatible I'm out of luck since I 100% need them no matter what because I have double vision
2024-03-30,"Bigscreen Beyond
personalized VR that's meant for the you
enough said"
2024-03-30,"Apple really watched this and said ""lets copy this and charge triple the price"", lmfao."
2024-03-30,Bro. Mega man x in the background. Big win.
2024-03-30,now i have the mood to play a bit with my Rift S
2024-03-30,If you are looking for small formfactor keep an eye out for the Bigscreen  Beyond
2024-03-30,the beyond headset was still first to have custom fit and prescription and it's cheaper and smaller than that!
2024-03-30,"Phil, no! Put the glasses down and get some clip in prescription lens inserts! Makes life so much more comfortable and prices are reasonable."
2024-03-30,"I'm using wifi6e to the quest 2 and it's awesome.  Low latency, and looks amazing.  I use Virtual desktop instead of the clunky oculus airplay.  You also need to be line of sight to the 6e router and have that router wired straight into the gaming PC for best performance.  Wireless is so nice!"
2024-03-30,prices are going the wrong direction. we need more offerings in the quest 2 price range to really get the masses on board with VR.
2024-03-30,"If you want to look like an update of Jeff Goldblum's ""The Fly"" they're perfect!"
2024-03-30,I can't wait for Big Screen's VR headset
2024-03-30,Taken the bullet for us
2024-03-30,Let's not forget that the Quest Pro was 1599 euro's before the XR was released.
2024-03-30,"To be fair, you're buying insane pro-sumer headsets that 95% of VR/AR/XR owners will never buy."
2024-03-30,"I'm more curious about the tech. It's out of my price range right now, but want it for the same reason you guys are getting it. Sims. In particular ATS and DCS."
2024-03-30,"@13:50
Phil looks like a Minion"
2024-03-30,"to your sponsor vid.. I feel your pain, Corsair cables really are the worst to manage"
2024-03-30,"Wow, had no idea that the Quest Pro dropped from $1,500 to $999 in March. Not too surprised it was over-priced, even when targeted at professionals, but $999 is more reasonable. At this point though i'll wait to see what Quest 3 can offer."
2024-03-30,kinda funny seeing all the tech then a random CRT tv just sitting in the back.
2024-03-30,A battery that big on my head is scary not gonna lie.
2024-03-30,Dioptre compensation is great but it's not going to do away with the need for glasses unless it can do astigmatism compensation too
2024-03-30,"""These would break on the TV"""
2024-03-30,Congratulations on being the first and only american citizen that knows approximately what a meter is.
2024-03-30,"Love to see VR on this channel. It was over hyped at the start, it's taking a while for the tech to mature and for developers to come on board but XR will be a big part of the future. Currently rocking a Quest 2 and an Index, same as you mostly for sim racing but I'm waiting for a large fov micro LED device before I next upgrade. This from HTC looks over=priced, the form factor is a step in the right direction but not if it isn't comfortable, you could give me the highest spec headset on the market but if it hurts or irritates to wear it then it's pointless."
2024-03-30,"I've been an engineer for almost 40 years (retired).  I am confused as to how the new generation of engineers think.... or don't.  Did nobody wear the headset during R&D?  Did they not notice the failures in design?  How or why did any of the team decide the product was ready for production?  With CAD, CNC and 3D printing, product development is far easier and faster than it was in my day.  Revisions could be made quickly and cost effectively.  There is no excuse for the rather poor designs.   For the amount of money they charge for these headsets, they should be as perfect as present tech allows.  It doesn't cost more to think well.  At least that was the idea in my day."
2024-03-30,"I like the thumbnail of this video, It's just say: ""Why did i do this to myself?"""
2024-03-30,Look forward to the review.
2024-03-30,Nailed the Kamen Rider look
2024-03-30,I was subscribed to 13 Channels for the past year in order to make a well informed decision when I built my latest computer. However the computer has been complete for a few months now and I no longer need all those channels so I reduced my computer peripherals related list of channels down to 1. Guess which one. Yours !! Congratulations
2024-03-30,"Man, really agree about the facial interface. I have a beak of a nose that gets cut up by the headset limiting my use to 30min. I hope with this video some company makes a facial interface that closes on the side and bottom properly and doesn't dig into my nose! I love the device because the image quality is really clear, the tracking is really good and not needing wires to play games on the PC is really amazing!"
2024-03-30,Man that Varve XI surely looks interesting!
2024-03-30,"A solution to your glasses issues, which may have been provided already, is a company called VR Optician. They make prescription lenses for VR headsets that just slide on and off. That way you don't have to wear glasses, and don't run the risk of glasses scratching the lenses. I have a giant head so my glasses don't fit into VR headsets so these lenses are a must."
2024-03-30,"With vr being at what feels like the end of its current gen. I bought the Hp reverb g2 for 450 cuz just the best bang for your bucks with visuals. I only use it for Sim racing and flight games. The hud is not as nice as the Meta Quest 2 and the controllers are not the greatest but the visual are just on another level. Waiting for quest 3 reveal amongst others as the Pico 4, Vive XR Elite, Big Screen VR, Pimax 12k or Crystal etc none of them seem to have enough of innovation to warrant me spending another $500+ min for a headset."
2024-03-30,The most comfortable headset would be the big screen headset
2024-03-30,Price of VR goes up but there's still only a handful of noteworthy games on it... That makes sense.
2024-03-30,"Me when VR first came out: I'll wait fot the tech to become easier to produce and therefore the price to come down.
The price: TO THE MOOOON!! 
Guess i'll just not do VR in my lifetime xD"
2024-03-30,"HP Reverb G2 user here and only for Sim racing. Cant beat VR, even the lower end HMD's are great, just better is better ;)"
2024-03-30,I wish it released in my country so that I didn't have to pay massive import fees.
2024-03-30,13:50 Phil just turned into a minion.
2024-03-30,Isn't that the goggles they wore in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory?
2024-03-30,I would love Phil's perspective. I haven't jumped into VR yet because of a combination of cost and needing vision correction.
2024-03-30,"Hearing that pricing and seeing the price jumps over the past year +, makes me happy I got my Quest 2 when I did for $300 (also picked up the tether as well).  I really want to get an Index, but I know compact and better things are coming."
2024-03-30,"So the quest may be comfortable, but I dare you to jump around with it."
2024-03-30,"That is the trend with these companies now. Supply less and charge more. Until enough people say shove it, we are not buying that crap, they will keep doing it. NVIDIA is the perfect example."
2024-03-30,"I do have one. Preorder at launch. I would not recommend it. I use mine in glasses mode with the battery in a waist pack or with 30watt wall charger. Still presses on my nose and face googles are atrocious It just feels like this is a business model with some consumer features. It tries to do too many things and none of it stellar. Tracking issues, controller problems, menus always in a different place, spinning icon instead of giving room error, etc.  A step closer but not there."
2024-03-30,"Off topic big guy, Cooling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, what if you put 20 glass + containers in front of the intake would it bring down the temp."
2024-03-30,look into the bigscreen beyond. It's releasing this summer
2024-03-30,Only seven more generations before VR is consumer grade.
2024-03-30,The quest pro officially launched at 1.3k so it has went down. Although I would like to see the price brought down to about 700 for the standalone headset. Charging dock and controllers optional with backwards compatibility with the Quest 2 controllers.
2024-03-30,"I still want a new headset that accepts real video input, not just the GPU video encoder shitting frames with as low latency as possible (and performance penalty as it is not FREE perf as any GPU vendor says). I guess I can say good bye to all the new XR2/XR2+ based products.
Right now, I'm using the Quest 2 with an aftermarket head strap, just for the depth perception on the virtual tracks really."
2024-03-30,"I guess the glasses thing is only if you have normal + or -. If you have a cylinder (which i have) I guess that won't work?

That said: lenses exist."
2024-03-30,"Yeah, no. I have a Reverb G2 and I'm quite happy with it. Stand-alone seems like a great concept, but I don't like the idea of a battery of that size being strapped to the back of my head. Failures are quite rare, I understand - but that's just something that still doesn't sound like a very good idea. At the very least, I'd like to see how they fail under various conditions, just to see if they bothered at all to engineer around the scenario. Until then, I'd much rather have a slightly larger and longer-lasting battery included that clips to your belt, and runs a short tethered cable to the headset. Maybe even have a slightly more powerful processing unit located in the belt-pack while they're at it - which will help reduce the weight of the headset even further too."
2024-03-30,"Hi Jay, the faceplate issue is quite common. We from FPV drones flying have same issues. As example DJI goggles are great but the faceplate is ......"
2024-03-30,"VR is definitely for almost for everybody, its just a bit expensive to get good vr right now, and people pick it up for mostly the wrong reasons, and once you have tried some bad VR experiences your view on VR is generally tainted. Know that there is amazing VR and it will only get better."
2024-03-30,It's only niche because of the cost of entry. I still enjoy the videos even though i know I could never justify the price.
2024-03-30,"I want to buy into vr... But I still can't justify it. I play a lot of sim racing/ driving stuff... So the immersion would be amazing. But at the same time, my 55"" tv directly in front of my wheel does wonders for the "" immersion"" factor."
2024-03-30,"""VR isn't for everyone""
Even for the people that it is for, they got it for racing sims, flight sims, and beat saber. 
Outside of Half Life Alyx, what has been a ""killer app"" for VR? Playing an already existing game that you've already played, but now in VR for a few hours until the novelty of it wears off? 
Another puzzle game? Another horde defense? A puzzle game with horde defense?"
2024-03-30,Makes me really appreciate the psvr2 more
2024-03-30,"It's a Quest 2 with 88 more vertical lines per eye. The processor is the same, the RAM is the same, the memory is the same. Still has LCD screens, although they are pancake lenses so it has that I guess, but paying more than double the Quest 3 price is ridiculous. This is only a purchase that could come from doing zero research."
2024-03-30,"Hello Hello!!! I can see even on Phil the eye surround looks narrow. Could you please get Nick to test them out and give a quick opinion section? I have a BIG SIZED head and don't think the whole unit is wide enough for me to even use. Its sad that manufacturers seem to size their products for smaller users. Great unboxing Jay thanks. Stay safe, healthy and happy."
2024-03-30,Jay is the new Willy Wonka with that headset.
2024-03-30,"YAY I Can't WAIT for Phil's video XD, and yeah i Don't care about AR or XR. I just want a High enough Resolution that when I Play Assetto Corsa, Project Cars, or Elite Dangerous that it doesn't look like a last gen console game and doesn't hinder my long range Vision. In ED or any Racing Sime it is hard to make out car or track details at even a minor distance compared to my 27in 4k PG27UQ so if we could get pixel density that can match 4k at 12-18 inches from you face and with no motion sickness inducing flaws (I am Talking about YOU HP Reverb 2)"
2024-03-30,"The thing I am looking forward to is the day you can lay AR or XR games that are Resident Evil or w/e, but in your own house. That way, when you have nightmares after playing for too long, you'll be at home! lol"
2024-03-30,"With the PS VR 2 and quest 2 or 3, you can get prescription lenses"
2024-03-30,VR is so cool! VRCHAT is my most used application by far. But I feel the aging Index is still the best deal around. I would like to know how this one runs over PCVR in Vrchat.
2024-03-30,You guys need to contact Bigscreen and get them to send you a Beyond headset.  That's the next big (or small) PCVR headset.
2024-03-30,Anyone looking into PCVR should focus on the bigscreen headset that just came out. Hybrid headsets really aren’t primed yet. I swapped from my quest 2 over to a valve index. Wish I had just waited for the bigscreen headset.
2024-03-30,"Just seeing the thumbnail, ill have to agree with you."
2024-03-30,"For VR racing, this is not the type of headset I'd be going for. I used a HP Reverb G2, which has an amazing graphical quality (was better than Index and Vive pro 2), but still pretty damn cheap for VR. When I looked to upgrade EVERYONE in sim flight and racing points straight at the Varjo Aero as the best you can get if you're willing to pay the cost (they were right, its freaking amazing)"
2024-03-30,Just when I thought that Jay already looks a lot like Batou (from ghost in the shell)
2024-03-30,You should reserch about custom facial interfaces
2024-03-30,"I straight up don't understand why VR headsets try everything in the book to not be helmets, when the shape of a helmet is absolutely perfect for comfort. All that weight evenly distributed, you don't need any amount of pressure anywhere near your face, plenty of room for all the tech including ample battery capacity, and if you gave that thing a tinge of active cooling, my bet is it would be leaps and bounds more comfortable to wear than any of the headsets we currently have."
2024-03-30,"I know they are going for small and light form factors, but I also wonder what it would be like if they basically made a motorcycle helmet with a visor. 

With the size and stuff you could put in it, it would probably weigh more, but it would also distribute the weight a lot across your entire head."
2024-03-30,Scuba phil made me instantly think scuba steve
2024-03-30,Hopefully you get your hands on a bigscreen beyond...should be very light and comfy.
2024-03-30,"Wow, Jay has janitorial staff he can yell at.."
2024-03-30,"For Phil's issues with his glasses and VR headsets, there are a lot of companies out there (like WIDMOvr and VROptician) that make dedicated prescription lens inserts for every VR headset out there...they don't cost all that much and work surprisingly well vs trying to wear the headset over your glasses.
It's wild to me that the Valve Index is as old as it is, yet it's still beating out the newer headsets in pretty much every category...the resolution and supported framerate is still holding up against the competition, the audio solution is far better, and the controllers are miles ahead of any other that's come out. About the only complaint you could make (besides the price) is that it's tethered, but even then, tether-less VR looks pretty bad on more complex games (it's fine on simple stuff like Beat Saber, but on something like HL Alyx or Budget Cuts 2 it's very obviously scaled down and looks considerably worse). The manufacturers need to stop focusing completely on tether-free VR, and instead start working on getting tethered VR down into much more affordable ranges first (as well as doing way more study on ergonomics, especially for controllers)."
2024-03-30,"If you have regrets about any product, I'm very happy to take it from you!"
2024-03-30,I just love that corsair ad
2024-03-30,I’m a vr enthusiast. How did I miss this was even in development?
2024-03-30,"Oculus, htc, valve, or any other VR/AR headset manufacturer needs to take notes from companies like FatShark or DJI... They love making goggles with screens, and they do it really well. Yes, there is more tech that goes into VR/AR, but i feel like goggles could still be as small as FPV goggles with all the functionality of VR/AR"
2024-03-30,Still love my Valve Index.
2024-03-30,"Jay, gamers I follow that really like and try lots of VR stuff and sim racing actually recommend the HP Reverb G2, due to quality and also being lighter / small / comfort, in case you up to try another one."
2024-03-30,"Seems like the best headset right now is the one from Bigscreen. Especially if you have an Index since you can just use your whole setup with it so no need for extra purchase.
In 1 or 2 gen, VR will be much more amazing with all the new tech constantly coming out."
2024-03-30,"Everyone is a little different. For me, I really don't like HMDs that rest on the forehead. It gives me a headache after a while. I'm so used to my Vive Pro against my face, that this wouldn't bother me much at all."
2024-03-30,"Oh Jay! Speaking of small VR headsets, have you seen the Bigscreen one? ThrillSeeker and i think VR Oasis have done videos on it."
2024-03-30,"A step forward and 2 steps back, k thanks!"
2024-03-30,I'm looking forward to Bigscreen Beyond VR headset.
2024-03-30,"I think you should more clearly say that those are professional headsets no gamer should buy unless they really really know what they want. A Quest 2 or Pico 4 with a good custom headstrap and face cover from BOBOVR or AMVR is way cheaper and probably better for 95% of gamers usecases. Viewer of this channel that don't know much about VR might get the impression that VR is super expensive just watching this video.
That being said I like that you are adding some VR stuff to the channel. Keep up the good work!"
2024-03-30,"Y'all need to take a a look at the Pico 4 headset, seems like a hugely better step than the quests in general."
2024-03-30,Use VR for cardio! BeatSabre and Powerbeats!!! Amazing cardio workouts....
2024-03-30,It almost looks like the binocular goggles from the original Jurassic park movie.
2024-03-30,"Something I found odd but also pleasant was when I was when I got my Quest 2, I was expecting cheap plastic like the HTC elite. But it's not, I dropped my headset and the controllers, and they handled it like a champ. People can hate on the quest 2 all they want, but I have never regretted buying it, it's a solid headset. of course i was expecting a meh line up of software but i love that it can do pcvr."
2024-03-30,why not use the Bigscreen VR. its small and integrated with your prescriptions.
2024-03-30,"And still to this day we have no studio trying to push for a product of quality like HL Alyx...i have 2 headsets, they have not been used in more than a year because there is nothng new on the horizon of quality to play"
2024-03-30,the HTC Vive XR looks like the glasses from the movie Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
2024-03-30,Next up: JayZ reviews CPAP headsets. Tune in and strap on!
2024-03-30,Please more VR content!!
2024-03-30,"I hear the rokid max is pretty good, they even have manual focus so you can wear them without prescription lenses"
2024-03-30,"I returned by own Vive XR Elite. Click bait title aside, Jay's impression is spot on. Got it because it should be lighter and more comfortable, but it's not more comfortable. I returned to my Wireless Vive Pro 2, which is heavy on top of having the antlers wireless add-on. That actually cushions, whereas the XR Elite does not.
Jay is in for a bad time with the optics. I have a better time with my VP2, which every shits on. The XR Elite has very bad glare plus the tiny FOV, and many of us have had stuck pixels.
The XR experience was also ass. Totally not mapped correctly, so they corrected around the hands, which just made everything super disorienting.
Also no apps I want to use. Where's my Audio Trip!
My Vive Pro 2 wireless is faster to get going in my room than the XR Elite.
Very sad."
2024-03-30,"I’m still running my Rift S, for $400, you can’t go wrong if you have the pc to run it.  Every GPU generation, I think, this is the one that will finally allow me to play vr games like I always hoped for.  But even a 4090 still isn’t there yet.  Maybe it’s my headset tbh"
2024-03-30,Love my Valve Index!
2024-03-30,Meta Quest are miles ahead in the VR market at this point.
2024-03-30,"I watched Ready Player One for the 3rd time the other day and since I've researched all the different headsets i noticed something, well, all the different headsets. VR won't become popular because everyone will see how great it is and buy one. VR will become popular because enthusiasts will upgrade & give their old headset away to friends & families & everyone will have one for free since there will be hundreds of millions floating around the globe"
2024-03-30,Incredible how expensive they make it to be... those controllers are probably like 30 bucks from the factory...
2024-03-30,"I personally prefer AR over VR. I hoped Microsoft's Hololens would really go off and we could eventually game with them but I don't see that happening any time soon. And as to VR, I have two games where I could use them and I'm not willing to pay 1000+€ for a setup for just two games."
2024-03-30,i like how there are slots for the straps to go through but this thorough review missed it. (extra sarcasm on thorough)
2024-03-30,"Waiting for 150degrees Horizontal FOV to become the standard, and companies to start using high count dimming (HDR) zone screens. 
I know Quantum Dot and OLED are great but they have issues with pancake lenses atm which I think are also required moving forward if we want VR headsets to be smaller/lighter (and we do).  
There is the Pimax Crystal but sadly it costs a fair bit more and has a reduced FOV which is quite unfortunate. (also its huge)"
2024-03-30,"It's my understanding that you could use the Steam Index controllers+Lantern system with the quest line, and maybe other headsets as well. I haven't tried it myself. The Index controllers seem like they are really superior."
2024-03-30,"When you do the review video. Can you please do a camera through the VR lens, then people can see what they're actually going to see. Not just the video capture.
I bought a HTC vive and it barely gets used because it looks like a crt up close.... 

That one certainly looks like it needs a dozen different face pieces to suit everyone."
2024-03-30,Phil looks like a Minion.
2024-03-30,"Phil, I feel your pain. I am like -9.45 and -10 on my prescription lenses. I ended up ordering from VR wave and using their lenses on my Quest 2. That is why I have the Quest 2."
2024-03-30,"You all should get a little cheap geiger counter to check dust like that on the stuff sent over here from countries that have waste to dispose of.  It would add some intrigue to the video to include a radiation check in your product reviews.  A lot of this consumer electronics junk that has robbed many of money lately has sat there on warehouse shelves being exposed to radioactive dust for months now.  If not sitting in the same cargo containers that this waste sat in for many months before.

Don't breathe that dust."
2024-03-30,Tony Stark did it in a cave with a box of scraps!
2024-03-30,have you looked into the bigscreen beyond? they're basically the size of swim goggles.. downside is they're basically fitted to 1 person
2024-03-30,Nice thumbnail guys!️
2024-03-30,I have the Valve Index and I love it
2024-03-30,"You look like the moth guy on the tv show ""The Tic""  and Phil's a minion haha"
2024-03-30,So so so happy i went with the meta pro i was so close to biting a xr elite
2024-03-30,Phil looked like he was trying out to be a minion.
2024-03-30,12:42 I think those slots are intended for that strap
2024-03-30,"Interesting. So, I was thinking about getting these because they look really portable and I'm homeless and game on a laptop. My biggest concern is the resolution, which I wish was 4k per eye."
2024-03-30,All I have is a Project Morpheus hooked up to my PS5 & I absolutely love it & I don't even have social apps like VR Chat or Metaverse. Come ooooooon SonyVerse
2024-03-30,Wait- I just watched the whole video to find out what major issue came up that made him feel like he got ripped off. But at no point did he say he regretted buying it. Or anything about him getting ripped off. What's with the video title?? Is it standard now that they have nothing to do with the video?
2024-03-30,"""The Fly,"" the original movie."
2024-03-30,My icue setup linked in with my MSI setup which was epic.
2024-03-30,Glad I didn't pull the trigger on this guy. Guess the wait for the next generation of high quality wired VR headsets shall continue.
2024-03-30,"3:57 - The white ones are Wiimotes, Jay.
Not Quest controllers."
2024-03-30,sigh i have no idea what companies have against quality controllers. literally the biggest reason i went with index. i'm not paying a buttload of money for cheap to sub par controllers.
2024-03-30,Mixed reality has a lot of good benefit in flight sims. This way you can see all the control and switches without lifting the headset. The prescription correction is something ive been waiting for in vr. Wearing glasses is a pita and even with glasses I felt that it needed an adjustment. I use to have the HP reverb G2 and sold it. VR is just not good enough yet for me to be comfortable using it.
2024-03-30,Looks like the night vision in Jurassic park
2024-03-30,If you want glass like experience then try out Rokid Max AR glasses
2024-03-30,"I'm absolutely shocked that we aren't using retired/out of certification range racing helmets for VR.

Hmmmmmmmm."
2024-03-30,"Phil the Scuba Diver, make it happen!"
2024-03-30,looks like the head strap has slots to thread through to be more centered
2024-03-30,"i KNEW i wasn't the only one who thought that about  the XR elite..  god, its like a cult trying to get someone who has one trying to admit its not great.  Quest Pro is clearly leading the industry in terms of tentpole features and specs."
2024-03-30,"Rule of thumb in the UK...If a wearable makes you look like a twxt, it's pile of sh:te. Rules holds well here...Costs need to lower for tech to improve. With VR we always feel like we're another five years away."
2024-03-30,"VR is a niche market, just like mGPU, S.L.I Crossfire & Gpu physX."
2024-03-30,I'm quite happy with reality as it is. You can keep you virtual and augmented versions to yourselves.
2024-03-30,Still waiting for a worthwhile upgrade from a Valve Index....
2024-03-30,bigscreen make a smaller head set for vr much lighter yall should check that out
2024-03-30,"If you look at VR YouTubers, none of them were impressed with the new vive when they revealed it. HTC is really behind. They started it all, but they fell behind. Just stick with Quest or Index. Vive trackers are great though, and the new ones are even smaller with more battery!
I would love to see you guys cover the BigScreen Beyond!"
2024-03-30,"Quest Pro was originally $1500, they reduced the price due to low sales so you might actually have paid MORE for it..."
2024-03-30,"I had a Quest 2 and loved the VR experience, but the whole thing with wearing glasses with it just ruined it for me. Sold it, and won't buy another one until they have what your HTC Vive has there, the dioptre control for each eye. For me thats a deal maker or breaker."
2024-03-30,You guys check out Bigscreen's VR glasses when they drop. Supposed to be smaller and oled.
2024-03-30,"I would love a vr setup but my ceiling in my basement where my gaming setup is, is pretty low and i know I'd end up punching the ceiling"
2024-03-30,They remind me of the night vision headset in Jurassic Park for some reason.
2024-03-30,"""Phil put this against your face""
a minion is born"
2024-03-30,The best thing about those Jay is that they're not that noticeable on your face
2024-03-30,"Told you Jayz buy Pimax Crystal, it is big and heavy but balanced and the best out there :)"
2024-03-30,Bigscreen beyond definitely seems more suited to you
2024-03-30,cameras have dioptric correction for a decades
2024-03-30,See if you can get your hands on Bigscreen Beyond!
2024-03-30,Price of new VR is only going up but I got a second hand windows mixed reality headset for ~£200 and most of them can be got for less than that.  I can wait for lighter headsets to be available on the used market.
2024-03-30,"Yeah, there is a SERIOUS problem with the XR Elite's controllers, and the usage duration is really bad. As for comfort, most headsets will be Night and Day, based on your head profile. I feel as though companies know how to make VR headsets well, but whenever they want to include AR, they are either completely clueless or make something that costs 5x the price."
2024-03-30,"Google glasses did try and do VR glasses, augmented reality. I don't see why you cannot project images onto lenses from around the frame or microfibres within the lenses"
2024-03-30,"It's about time Corsair is revamping thier rgb management, it's an absolute cluster fuck, especially if you have more than 6 fans"
2024-03-30,it is really nice that Vive has the dial for dioptre adjustment but sadly they are not enough for my prescription . But at least that will help many other people. Also the strap looks like a bra strap.
2024-03-30,These look like Johnny Depp's Willie Wonka glasses
2024-03-30,"I have 6 head sets. This one is a no from me. 
Also, the prescription adjustment is great. Except that there is positive and negative prescriptions. My prescription is -4.25."
2024-03-30,I'll wait for the holodeck.
2024-03-30,"I tried VR about two years ago. I just didn't really find it that interesting. For some reason I like looking at a monitor to game. I didn't get sick or anything from it, I just thought it was a lesser experience. I think in a few more years I may revisit it as the tech matures."
2024-03-30,The funny thing is Apple Vision Pro also has this top strap
2024-03-30,Looking like a Jaylien with those on
2024-03-30,"Omg, the fly."
2024-03-30,"They only have adjustment for positive diopter? Or are those numbers meaningless? I have a -2 diopter.
The main issue with the quest is software, not hardware."
2024-03-30,"When will VR ever become mainstream if the cost doesn't come down. Even the console level is the cost of a new console, not to mention the cost of non-indie games these days"
2024-03-30,"So you bought a non gaming vr head set and feel ripped in gaming.
Cool."
2024-03-30,Maybe 3D printing a head belt as a headset helps?
2024-03-30,"Bruh the XR Elite was $1300 at launch and the Quest Pro was $1200. Im not a fan of XR basically ur being charged for a 2015 cell phone chip set in ur HMD that you will never use because they want to control the experience and devs dont like developing for PC because and this is an exact quote from a VR game dev I was talking to ""Developing for PC is hard."""
2024-03-30,"Why buy this, not a HP Reverb G2, or a Pymax Crystal or 8KX, or a Varjo Aero ?"
2024-03-30,Gotta admit 6:50 that's like a 250% increase in dumbness but I kinda love it at the same time. I WOULD NEVER WEAR IT THO so that's probably a problem
2024-03-30,I wish you guys would put your lower third stuff a little bit higher so I can read it with subtitles on.
2024-03-30,"I have the XR Elite,. I pre-ordered right after CES. I like it and the XR side of it is pretty cool actually and that surprised me. I got it for three main reasons, first it's compact and lite. Second the built in diopters.  Third to play DCS with, hoping for mixed reality so I can see my physical mfd's and controllers in game.  It's not perfect and all of your initial points on the headset are spot on. I can tell you this the pushing out on the arms by the battery pack is going to be an issue. After @40hrs of use both arms above and below the speakers cracked . Look at how weak the arms are around the speakers. This seems like it should have been an obvious outcome with the design. The field of view isn't impressive. It reminds me of the old arcade game Seawolf looking through the periscope. That said what it can do is impressive and I don't regret buying it. HTC has it back atm to RMA the arms and we'll see if they correct the flaw. Learning nothing I've pre-ordered the Pimax Crystal for the wider and better view, even though it's massive and $600 more than the XR."
2024-03-30,"VR market lost me at quest 2... First i had a vive cosmos, which sucked and i quickly sold it and got my money back.  The Quest 2 i was actually gonna buy, until they rebranded it to meta quest 2 and the price went from 2999 NOK for the 128gb one to 5999 NOK which is about from 300 dollars to 600 dollars, which for me is just hell no..."
2024-03-30,Jay with the XR on you look like Sam Fisher from Syphon Filter
2024-03-30,"The price of headsets are going up, but the traction of VR isn't. I love it but there are so many missteps, from HTC and Oculus I refuse to call them by their stupid other name."
2024-03-30,should've gone with the Bigscreen VR headset instead - genuine upgrade over the Valve Index
2024-03-30,It's always hard on HTC when compared by price with Meta. Has HTC doesn't make money on your personal data and Meta does. So when using a Meta headset you keep paying you headset with your personal data as long as you use the headset.
2024-03-30,"What did he mean by this 5:40? Quick latency compared to what? Wi-Fi? Since he did mention Wi-Fi 6. Or quick latency compared to other cables? What was he refering to when he said ""quick latency"""
2024-03-30,"I had an Occulus Rift, which was really cool for a while, but eventually the little things led me to get rid of it.

I thought using VR with racing sims would be amazing, but that lasted about 2 minutes for me. Nausia city.

If I were to get back into it, I'd really want something next-level. Some things are close, but then have a strange quirk or cost half as much as my PC."
2024-03-30,It would be great if you did indepth SimRacing review with this VR
2024-03-30,This looks like it was made by a gnomish engineer in World of Warcraft.
2024-03-30,packed by someone with severe dandruff
2024-03-30,Should order you a Bigscreen VR headset. Custom fitted for your face.
2024-03-30,they are flimsi/soft so they  not broke when they fall down. thats normal
2024-03-30,is it plus or minus 6. Didnt look like they had both
2024-03-30,Quest 2 has prescription inserts
2024-03-30,So should i wait for Quest 3 then or is this headset worth it? I just want to upgrade because quest 2 is utterly garbage
2024-03-30,i am personally using the pico 4 for vr and its amazing comfort wise and the resolution is also great 2160x2160 per eye and its like 300$ i think
2024-03-30,"They look nice, but I don't like those VR glasses. If it is too narrow for you, then me with my big head can't even start using them. I'm using the Pico4 at the moment and for the price and performance they are great. Still not ideal. The Big Screen VR glasses have a more ideal size, but since they are wired, a nogo for me."
2024-03-30,"I understand why VR headsets are so expensive. The companies manufacturing them are usually first and foremost hardware companies and have to stand to make a profit on each unit sold. The exception here is Valve, they're both software and hardware, but they don't stand to make any real money on the software side by selling a VR unit. However, there is absolutely no reason why Facebook don't subsidise Quest headsets other than they are overwhelmingly greedy. They should be prepared to make a considerable loss if they want people to buy into their metaverse garbage."
2024-03-30,VR will always be a weird niche for gaming....
2024-03-30,I got one and the real issue was that it was released too early and feel like an unfinished product
2024-03-30,"Is there no HMD that is just a 3d big screen monitor you can wear on your head and not a VR or AR? All I want is a high rez virtual display of 100"" at 6-10 ft or similar to get a private home movie/game display that do not require 1/3 of my living room, does that even exist and am I the only one that want one?"
2024-03-30,"Having owned about 10 different headsets...HTC has always felt the cheapest. This would be fine if they delivered a budget friendly price, but with them increasing...it'll always be a no from me."
2024-03-30,You should still cap the video bc those of us that know VR can still see certain things.
2024-03-30,Hubris is the VR bechmark. Most impressive looking VR game
2024-03-30,I had the same problem as Jay with the face gasket being to small. Also the software side needs work.
2024-03-30,"Great review.  I was really curious about how it compared since I got a Quest Pro mainly because of the wireless.  I also like the face and eye tracking, and the controllers.  I'll look at the other video you metioned for a more detailed review"
2024-03-30,Would like to see a quest 3 review and how it compares to these 2 whenever that's out.
2024-03-30,bigscreen VR is what your lookin for
2024-03-30,"I'm using the rift s still. Really want something lighter and less bulky, but I figure we are still a ways from that"
2024-03-30,Sleestak eyes from original Land of the lost!  lmao
2024-03-30,"Thanks for your review Jay! Good to see this and other headsets with adjustment for prescription lenses. Unfortunately, for people with significant astigmatism and some other eye conditions, the headset correction isn't enough and you will still need to wear glasses for a clear image. I have strong astigmatism but luckily the prescription aftermarket VR lenses available work fantastically. just a pain that you have to remove them for someone else to use your headset."
2024-03-30,"Whenever I look at the prices for VR stuff, I'm so happy, that it is for the most part still just a very niche gimmick."
2024-03-30,"Johnny Depp, Willy Wanka vibes from that headset."
2024-03-30,"I still love my Valve Index. Paid 1500 Canadian for the complete set, back in I believe it was in 2018. I use it for mainly driving sims such as American Truck sim. For those who haven't experienced it, puts you right in the game. So much more immersive, adds a whole new level to gaming! Im running an entry card right now gtx 1070. Can't wait for a better graphics card. The reason I went with the Valve Index, the controllers. They attach to your hands vs holding the controllers!  Jay, you guys should consider trying that system. Can you add this system in your review Phill?"
2024-03-30,"Don't know how I will use other VR headsets since I myself have a Quest 2 and it works with my glasses and doesn't touch the lenses which from what I hear is a rare thing in VR headsets.  Also despite the lens correction, 6 isn't the same as -6.  Granted for me that number would have to be a -11(yes I'm blind).  Even aftermarket lens covers only go to -10...."
2024-03-30,Why do the lens adjustments go from 0 to 6? What about people with negative correction?
2024-03-30,I accidentally put my quest controllers through some wood panelling in my basement playing skyrim VR and they were fine.
2024-03-30,"you shouldve bought Pimax Crystal instead. At the moment the best headset, especially for sims
small form factor always comes with disadvantages, the most obvious one: The FOV. Way too small on such small headsets."
2024-03-30,"That is not a retreating hairline. 
With your hair done like that it
looks like a full speed panic run
away from your face!"
2024-03-30,"Jay, try getting your hands on a PICO 4 headset. It will supprise you how much you can get for o third of the price of the VIVE! It even does some things better that those headsets..."
2024-03-30,Phil will laugh at anything Jay says
2024-03-30,the VR headset makes you look like an alien... do not probe  us  pewny humans please
2024-03-30,$20 says those vision dials don't get to my prescription.
2024-03-30,He should get the big screen beyond. For racing sim
2024-03-30,Here I was hoping VR would start getting cheaper so I could finally start playing Half Life Alyx... and the price of new sets seems to go up as the build quality goes down...
2024-03-30,Jay... bro.. there is literally a slit in the side of that VR set on both sides for that head strap.. lol
2024-03-30,They brought the price down of the Quest to match well now to beat the price of the Vive. If you bought the Quest before the Vive came out it was 1400$
2024-03-30,VR is still too expensive for me. Too bad there aren't more manufacturers.
2024-03-30,"The glasses modification interest me, not going to lie. Not interested in VR at this time. But like to stay relevant to what is happening in that area. Would love to hear everyone's view on the VR headsets you all have tried, just to know who has what shape and how it fits. I need glasses and that kills VR for me to use the headset, if I am honest. But I am also a Virtual Boy VR headset area guy to date myself."
2024-03-30,Valve index is still better in my honest opinion. They have better controls that feel tough compared to the flimsy looking quest version
2024-03-30,And that price is why the Quest 3 is sooooooo good at 500 bucks...
2024-03-30,Rage-quit proofing is very important feature of gamepads and other controllers. I'm sure I'm not only one who smacked xbox pad on the floor and repeatedly tried to bend horns in different directions. Xbox gamepad survived only with small crack. I highly doubt that this one will survive even fraction of my rage-handling.
2024-03-30,"I like VR, and appreciate the headset reviews. Not sure why others don't like it, but it doesn't matter."
2024-03-30,Not being able to use glasses is a deal breaker
2024-03-30,HP Reverb G2 still best headset for sim racing and flight. Love my quest 2 and want to get the quest 3 but different use case.
2024-03-30,"I might be wrong, but it seems to me that the head strap must go into the horizontal slots on the side of the headset."
2024-03-30,13:49 best moment
2024-03-30,"That fabric faceplate looks abysmally small, like trying to look through a comically undersized pair of scuba goggles"
2024-03-30,Just started looking at vr butnothing out there seems to deliver anything close to the reasonable price point. Might wait another 10 years and see how it matures.
2024-03-30,The ergonomics are optimized for the asian market
2024-03-30,"My problem is i want to go into AR, currently one of the best solution is the Microsoft Hololense 2 which cost around 4000€. So for me this 1900$ device safes my ass because it is cheaper. So maybe it would be nice if you can show how good AR is on that device."
2024-03-30,Thats how the scrapples vision pro actually will Look Like huh?  (Just saw the Thumbnail before the scrapple Fanatic lambs raging )
2024-03-30,"it has slots on either side of the glasses side ...the front side ...........for the strap..... so the strap can still be attached whilst the back is off.

..i noticed ..... 12:40

nice video tho m8.......i enjoyed it"
2024-03-30,"I preordered one of these, I actually have a video of my own doing an unbox. I will also be doing a video soon, since it's been my daily driver for a little over a month now. but quick thoughts.

 Do I feel like I got my moneys worth? No. I agree if feels cheap, it feels like they really didnt think about making this feel like a $1000+ headset, and its a shame, because it is so close. The software market is unacceptably small for the HTC store as well, it feels like this headset was abandoned before they even released it.

that being said. its pretty great at streaming PC games with out a cable and extremely low latency. I can play the hardest songs on synthrider and I dont have to worry about loosing tracking. and speaking of tracking, as much as I hate the feel of the controllers, this headset has some of the best inside out tracking I have experienced. I have never lost tracking on the controllers even when reaching behind my back or dropping my hands down to my sides.

This headset is also very light, my last headset was a Valve Index, and I could only really comfortably play for 3 hours before I started to REALLY notice how much weight was on my head. The XR Elite I haven't found a limit to play time yet, the top head strap makes a huge difference.

Over all, Im not as wowed as I hoped to be with the XR elite, but it does enough stuff right that I have no plan to go back to my valve index. I'm still waiting for a wireless headset that I love though. One day im sure."
2024-03-30,"Internal battery changeable? Doubt it, if it is I bet it ain't easy."
2024-03-30,"Still using my Samsung Odyssey+, with a top strap as well. Sound is excellent through the headphones and I bought prescription inserts for it as well. I see no reason to buy these new VR headsets as of yet. Especially since mine was $300."
2024-03-30,"When I look at VR I’m just interested in VR I’m not bothered about AR, AR should be kept to the google glass type hardware"
2024-03-30,"What do you expect for 2,000 dollars? Carbon fiber, real glass, diamond inlays. I think they should give you a free gpu to go with it. I might buy one then."
2024-03-30,Wait for Pimax crystal
2024-03-30,"So it costs more than the Index, but what does it offer over The Index?
(asking as a non-VR guy who has been eyeing VR since the PSVR release)"
2024-03-30,"I'd love to try an augmented reality headset more than full VR but there are two issues with any of this type tech.  Firstly the cost is way too high for me because of Secondly, my left eye is pretty bad since it can't focus properly meaning my whole life I've never been able to get any of those 3D type things to work.  Its an awful lot of money to put down to find out if a product works or not for any of the headsets and I don't have anybody I know living close that has any headsets I could give a try but I suspect it would take an awful lot of tinkering to get any of them to work well enough to be worth it."
2024-03-30,looks like the back piece is upside down.. plug on top ??? changes the angle of the rear rest aswell
2024-03-30,"I thought the whole point of the VR systems when they started with the them a number of years ago, is to make it affordable and for the masses. I they think just like the GPU companies, making it more and more expensive so only a few can afford any of that stuff."
2024-03-30,"Thanks for taking a look at more VR hardware, for Simulation games take a look at Varjo Aero or Pimax Crystal, or a loaner unit from XTAL for that heavy price point VR. Or give a Looking Glass Factory demo monitor loaner unit a try for testing their 3D glasses-free effect!"
2024-03-30,Or you can try installing VR glasses in a motorcycle helmet.  At least it will be a fun experience.
2024-03-30,You should try the bigscreen beyond. 2nd best headset out on the market(1st being the small range of varjo headsets)
2024-03-30,"Seen what the Q2 or the Pico 4 offer (with all the ups and downs), all this other headsets seem to be way overpriced. They have clear technological advancements but at those prices not gonna have enough market adoption to make a real difference."
2024-03-30,I got this headset for 500 for a reason.. cuz of the new updates and they bringing the USB facial and eye tracking. And Vive 4.0 self tracking trackers
2024-03-30,"Vive was a major player when VR first started out but it seems they've lost the ball

this was the first time I've heard their name since the valve index came out, and that was like 3 years ago now"
2024-03-30,"Don't discount the manufacturers intent with regard to stereo headsets.
I think HTC have done well when it comes to wearing something like a Corsair Virtuoso SE gaming headset on your skull. Most VR people don't like the crappy little speakers that come with some goggles."
2024-03-30,if you want a small vr headset buy a bigscreen beyond
2024-03-30,Still waiting for the possibility of getting just the controllers and House of the Dead so I can create a cheap arcade machine instead of using a wii or buying ludicrously expensive third party pistols.
2024-03-30,"Make a VR video, those interested will have an old vr or at least one of those phone cases"
2024-03-30,They need 2 or 3 different  sizes for the fitting
2024-03-30,"Hehe at least it can be used for a Riddick cosplay.
God bless."
2024-03-30,The slots for the top strap gotta be screaming for attention lmao
2024-03-30,Try the Bigscreen Beyond headset and let us know what you think.
2024-03-30,"My dude PLEASE review these I am hovering on the buy button. I want to boost my SIM racing experience with these, but I want to know how good the image looks in comparison with the oculus guest 2 and quest pro.  Have you guys tried VR with the 7900xtx cards? Apparently they run very poorly in VR."
2024-03-30,"I don't think I will ever buy another HTC headset. My first was an Index and it was a dream to use but too low resolution for good racing. I sold that and got a Vive Pro 2. It has been nothing but problems. The speakers always hiss, the mic is hot garbage, and the Vive Console is a giant pain. The Index just worked. With the Pro 2, it feels like I am constantly battling little, annoying issues."
2024-03-30,Had to get an aftermarket forehead rest for the quest pro because the factory one makes my forehead go numb!!!
2024-03-30,Untethered VR? Laughs in wireless Vive Pro :D
2024-03-30,I pre-ordered the HTC Elite as well and I have also been disappointed. I'm still hoping maybe Meta has a time exclusive agreement and more apps will be coming to the XR Elite.
2024-03-30,"Jay thinking $1000 for the Quest Pro is expensive, my buddy paid $1500 for his brand new, like, 3 days after launch"
2024-03-30,"Have tried alot of headsets, working in the XR business, and have the most of the headsets for development and testing.
The Oculus Pro is actually way better in almost all aspects. Better passthrogh, better weight distribution, better hand tracking, better controls.
The HTC is actually much worse then the Pico 4 in alot of things and that headset is half the price!
For personal use i would actually chose the Pico 4."
2024-03-30,"Great ad for corsair, and the headset is cool too."
2024-03-30,those look like the goggles the brown hornet (bill cosby) used back in the day @6:42 or even plasticman
2024-03-30,"My little brother has 3 kids and they just got a meta quest 2, we'll see how it holds up lol."
2024-03-30,"The big thing for me is being able to dial in the lenses to my prescription.  I have a big head as it is so the thought of getting a head on my head, over my glasses sucks.  I know the playstation one is fine but I am now mostly on PC.  I don't want to be in a situation where sony release a PSVR 3 and have to buy my games again."
2024-03-30,Still rocking a rift s. Thing's bulletproof
2024-03-30,It being smaller could be good for kids and women
2024-03-30,Meanwhile I still have the original Oculus Rift.
2024-03-30,"I think VR interesting, but I'm hesitant to buy a headset because I have glasses and my glasses aren't just corrective for near/farsightedness, but also correcting for strabismus."
2024-03-30,3:18 Cost goes up and quality goes down. Makes sense.
2024-03-30,Should’ve went with the varjo aero especially for sim racing.
2024-03-30,"It looks like a 300 dollar headset, not an 1100 dollar one."
2024-03-30,I want VR but don't trust the tech and the cost is too much
2024-03-30,i bought the xr elite on release and returned it the next day. comfort was not considered when making this headset at all
2024-03-30,"Racing Sims? Just grab Pimax 8K X and don't look back. I have just about every headset on the market for the last 4 years, it's the one I use for simulation nearly always."
2024-03-30,"I use the valve index. I've been looking into getting a new one because my index lenses melted, or at least the film on top of it melted. And they refuse to replace it, even though. I had one day left on the. Warranty, and I can't get a new one because they're never in stock. And I still don't really have the money, but it would be nice to get a new headset that isn't the index. And maybe something stand alone, so I can test avatars. I make avatars for VR chat. And it would be nice to test quests compatibility. I've also looked into the PICO 4. but man its hard to get stuff ""money"""
2024-03-30,galaxy s22 ultra + RiftCat VR is a good alternative if you're not depending on oculus VR market for games.
2024-03-30,"If it’s a headset for a racing sim, wouldn’t a pc only one like pimax or valve index work better?"
2024-03-30,"VR always cost a lot, we are still a few years away from market  scale lowering costs.  Costs are going up because Meta sold the Oculus quest 2 at a loss to gain market share.  VR never cost less there was just a company willing to lose money to promote it and got lots of sub par spec sets out into the market so that most developers focused on minimum function apps essentially pulling the whole market back.  Thanks facebook.  Maybe it was for the best but I miss exclusive PCVR days."
2024-03-30,Can't really see any sim racing game look any good with stand alone hmd because of compression artifacts. Large percentage of simers go for HP reverb G2 at around $600 or Pimax 8k but the crystal is due for release soon but that around $1800
2024-03-30,"6:37 
I don't like the way it doesn't occlude your eyes, it looks too small.
wish the diopter went to 7 ... better yet... I wish other VR makers would include diopter correction... I'm looking at you Zuck and Apple."
2024-03-30,I can’t believe he doesn’t know. I’ve seen pass through games running on quest 2.
2024-03-30,Guess it's a good thing I had LASIK a few years ago.  My prescription was -7.5/-7.75....
2024-03-30,Is the title a joke? I don't think he specifically said that the negatives added up to being anything more than inconvenient.
2024-03-30,You need to try the big screen beyond headset. That is the closest to ready player one. Very small like a pair of goggles really and very high end. I want one so bad but way too expensive because they don't come with controllers or lighthouses for tracking.
2024-03-30,"It's hard to see on the video, but isn't there a slot where the top head strap is supposed to go thru?"
2024-03-30,Diopter control only going to 6 is fairly disappointing.
2024-03-30,Canceled my XR preorder about a month ago after the initial reviews were pretty meh. I was drawn to the XR for its pass through and what I perceived to be a headset that looked like it would be comfortable. Jays first look reaffirmed my decision to look for a better option. In the end I went with the Pico 4. The Pico has its own issues but overall I’ve been pretty happy with it for MSFS
2024-03-30,Ill stick with a monitor untill those things cost a lot less then they do now.
2024-03-30,"lol, no wonder it's going up in price....the price is already prohibitively expensive, so few are bought, and new companies are trying to compete, making everyone keep their price up to keep a profit."
2024-03-30,13:48 LMAO
2024-03-30,"""What's all this dusty, flaky...?""  Either Asbestos or dandruff.  Assume the worst, hope for the best."
