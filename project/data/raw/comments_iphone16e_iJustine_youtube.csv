2025-03-06,"When creators say ""This is really interesting"" I promise you. That means ""I dont like this"" but in a nice way"
2025-02-25,If they dropped it down to $499 they might have a chance.
2025-02-25,"this is not a review, this is an ad."
2025-02-25,Tim Cook should employ iJustine.
2025-02-25,"Have all the negative points been forgotten? The price and the display, which is no longer up-to-date with a low brightness and refresh rate for the year 2025. And that Magsafe is missing?"
2025-02-25,"i was planning for iphone 16e i end up getting iphone 15 thanks to the apple sales guy he was like sir, buy iphone 15"
2025-03-06,"seriously ijustine , be honest . do a review . not an advertisement"
2025-02-25,Almost every review complaint about the price but you didn't. Sadly this is just a ad not review.
2025-02-25,"I agree with some other that this was not a review at all. The camera test... that was okay but not okay as a review for the phone.

What we all probably wanna see in a review is...

1 - benchmarks for Wifi, 4G and 5G speeds: 16e vs any other 16. Since this got Apple C1 chip and other iPhone 16 models got Qualcomm.

2 - how's the audio quality for phone calls? Maybe too difficult to measure talk time Wifi/4G.

3 - find an AirTag with 16e vs 16 since 16e don't have UWB. How bad is it to miss out precision find?

4 - how's the low-light (night) photo for 16e compared to SE3 or SE2 and compared to 16?

5 - do some macro photos with some 16 model that got the macro sensor/lens and try to do the same with 16e. How good or bad is 16e at macro photos?

That's five things to test that I believe most of us would love to see in an actual review :)"
2025-02-25,The reason I don’t sub to this channel is because it sounds more like a commercial then a review
2025-02-25,Great Apple Ad Justine!!
2025-03-06,"If there's one tech creator without an ounce of integrity, it's her !"
2025-02-25,"This is not a review, this is an ad"
2025-03-06,"As a general user of iPhone, I really love iPhone 16e.  It is a premium version of the budget iPhone SE with an upgraded body and specs. The 16e is also an upgraded version of XR!  Hope they will a 64GB choice.  I use only half of the 64GB storage of my current iPhone 12.  With that 64GB storage,  the 16e price might lower to 499$ perhaps."
2025-02-25,"3:22 Those photographic styles are not new, they are the same since iPhone 13"
2025-02-25,"2:41 - This bunker and radio tower were from Jurassic Park Fallen Kingdom 2018.
The bunker was the escape route when the volcano was erupting."
2025-03-06,"This is not a review, it is an ad"
2025-02-25,"I don't need to see the video,, she already love this phone"
2025-02-25,Justine is so pretty!
2025-02-25,she was laughing running away from the megasorass
2025-03-06,"Take it from an iphone SE 3rd generation owner, this is not a true value phone for what you are getting at $599.  If the same phone was available at a starting price at $499, then this could have been an outstanding value."
2025-03-06,wtf does she mean by under 600$ ??
2025-02-25,5:02 Omg that old YouTube app icon brings back memories. Just realised how much I missed this layout.
2025-02-25,Absolutely fine iPhone. But for elderly people an cheaper updated SE with fingerprint would be more welcome. The price-step from 16e to 15 or 16 (When Apple AI is needed) is not that big.
2025-03-06,"This is not an objective video, this is just advertising for an Apple product, which was also made available to the manufacturer free of charge. Credibility is zero."
2025-03-06,It's not a review without negative points being addressed.
2025-03-06,JURASSIC VALLEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2025-03-06,I freakin love Kualoa Ranch.
2025-02-25,"Conclusion: Don't buy the iPhone 16e because at that price it still doesn't have an Ultrawide camera. Sooner or later the Ultrawide camera will be useful for your life.
Just choose the iPhone 15. Buy it when the iPhone 17 is released."
2025-02-25,Worlds shortest review by ijustine ️
2025-02-25,Would the 16 plus be a better option than the 16e? I’m coming from a 12 pro max.
2025-03-06,"If you want the wide angle, just take a couple steps back, like back in the 90s/early 2000s"
2025-03-06,Thank you for being 1 of the only tech influencers that can still leave a review without sounding completely down and negative about everything that hits the market. This is a phone that I would definitely buy for a kid as a starter iPhone because it's everything they need and you can get these kind of phones as a great deal through a carrier carrier
2025-03-13,Even iJustine can't get excited about the 16e.
2025-02-25,Would you recommend this phone for a middle school kid?
2025-03-06,3:21 This phone uses the old filters that have been on iPhones for many many years… Referring to them as “new” is insane
2025-02-25,YALL THE TECH QUEEN GOT IT!!!
2025-02-25,Even Tim could not sell this idea this good!!! Terrible review!
2025-03-13,When ijustine can't even hype this up says a lot about Apple flopping this phone
2025-02-25,"People hate this thing for the $599 price, & I do think it being $399 would’ve been cooler, but I think this will excel as a ‘kids first iPhone.’ 

Sure, it’s supposed to be the “cheap” model, but when parents are shopping for their 12-13+ year olds first phone, I’m betting this will be their go-to choice. 

My second iPhone as a kid was the XS, & that thing cost $1,000+, so $599 for way better technology is a good modern day deal."
2025-02-25,Once they realized that it’s not selling with that $599 price point I ain’t buying it with no MagSafe no Island Dynamic no Camera Control but it does have a action camera buttion instead and no SIM card slot because of ESim which is not a great thing for travelers traveling on vacation outside the U.S. and with that only one camera option I’ll pass until they lower the price down to $479 then maybe we’ll revisit it again but until then yeah not getting it shoot it’s $899 just for a 512GB that’s krazy expensive still!
2025-03-06,This is by far the worst iphone 16e review on yt. I have seen apple fanguys literally being more honest even after they love apple a lot. Pls dont cheat your viewers with positive reviews.
2025-02-25,"Excited for me and my mom’s 16e to arrive Friday! We’re not photo buffs, we don’t use MagSafe, we’re used to 60hz panels in the 13 mini and 13, UWB while neat I don’t use much. t’s overkill for us to go with a pro, or 16. I’ll happily save the $200-300 without those other things."
2025-02-25,"2:32, If there's only one camera, why is there a color shift and a micro-stutter when zooming in from 1x to 2x while video recording?"
2025-03-06,She said twice if you want a pro phone or need ultra wide then don't get this phone. Its a fair review.
2025-03-06,The iphone glazer
2025-03-06,"It’s cute and nostalgic. I like the reduction to single camera lens and the simple black/white option. But as far as features go, the lack of MagSafe and Dynamic Island with the significant increase in price really ruin it for me. Also, the lack of camera control button. 

The iPhone SE was so affordable. I just think they priced themselves out of their intended market."
2025-03-06,"“Apple says the iPhone 16e is a ‘new family member,’ not part of the SE line. And let’s be real—no one introduces a new family member just to take out the old one. This isn’t a mafia movie… or is it?”"
2025-03-06,can u do an actual review like u used to ️
2025-02-25,Sweet spot? More like no spot! It’s an odd configuration with that price.
2025-02-25,Myyyy0:04...never knew iJustin u had skirts in yo wardrobe
2025-03-06,I love how it kinda looks like the 4 or 5 from years ago
2025-03-06,A lot of the reviews are very negative of the 16e. It’s obviously targeting the Samsung fan edition segment of the market. But this review felt too positive. I think apple made a big mistake not including magsafe. That would have sold them a lot more as it’s not a big enough reason to upgrade to the 16.
2025-03-06,"Another ad from iJustine, our favorite bias Apple fangirl!"
2025-03-06,"Hey so can we all agree that iJustine isn’t really a tech reviewer but rather an Apple plant. The clue is in the name of course but damn this may as well have been an advert. 

I’m not asking you to slag the phone off but at least mention some negatives as if they were a bad thing, or highlight alternatives for your fan base that surpass this for lower money. Taking poor photos and simply saying ‘so this is that this looks like’ You may as well be a politician frankly 

I don’t expect much only that you be a little more genuine with your audience"
2025-02-25,"I have been using the SE 3 for almost 3 years and I I’m not quite ready to switch. But if I were to switch, I’d get the 16e though it lacks Touch ID, physical SIM card, ringer switch, Lightning port, and (PRODUCT) RED. Also, it’s too big and a bit expensive.  But I think the pros out weigh the cons."
2025-03-06,"never seen this channel before but YouTube just recommended the video from 16 years ago where she got her first iphone, so here I am"
2025-02-25,This reminds me of iPhone XR. It's not iPhone SE 4.
2025-02-25,"I want to know how the cellular performance compares, especially in terms of how well it works in weak signal areas."
2025-03-06,"I have preordered it 2 days before, now it's all bad reviews, the 16e and the 15 here have a 25$ difference, so I chose to go for the 16e since I previously owned an iPhone 15, now I got back into android with A54, and all those bad reviews have me rethink my choises, but here am I, waiting for the 16e to come, thanks for the review iJustine, atleast u made me feel like it is not as bad as all the other channels."
2025-02-25,I was half expecting a cheaper phone and atleast a pink phone
2025-02-25,The camera is pretty good
2025-02-25,Thank you for having high quality uploaded videos ! not like other YouTubers …. Only 1080 in 2025
2025-03-06,"Great review justine love it, i think i start appreciating ip16E"
2025-02-25,Ooooh Jurassic Park
2025-03-06,This phone could please a lot of people who loved the iPhone 7.  Having face i.d. is a big plus.
2025-02-25,Ngl this is even a good upgrade for the xr
11  ago,I really don’t wanna hate on iJustine. I respect that she’s been in the game on YouTube uploading reviews for iPhones for a really long time but her reviews pretty much boil down to reading the description of the specs online. It’s literally just this is the new iPhone it comes with this amount of storage. It comes with this amount of RAM. The camera is this. I’m testing the camera right now….. and that’s it. She doesn’t give any actual individual opinion or critique. She just tells you what the phones about and that’s it. we already all got that from the presentations and announcements.
2025-03-06,I think the iPhone 16e is for kids! To be honest or for older people
2025-02-25,16e is the best looking one in 16s line up.
2025-02-25,I have a question …. What does resolution mean ??? Because my iPads resolution is higher than 10780p
2025-02-25,Please make 2016 type vlogs again with jenna and matty
2025-03-06,THIS IS AN AD FOR THE NEW PHONE!
2025-02-25,"i really wanted to like this phone, but $599? for smt that lacks features that even the 13-14 have?"
2025-02-25,5 min advertisement
2025-02-25,"16.1 inch screen

That voiceover originally claimed a 16.1 inch screen"
2025-02-25,"They should use you as a presenter for new , advanced and incredible apple devices launch events."
2025-03-06,Correct price is 429$
2025-02-25,Can I use 3rd party magsafe cases for it so it has magsafe?
2025-02-25,how does justine still look this good in her 40s.
2025-03-06,Next video compare vs iphone 13
2025-03-06,"A beautiful smartphone! Thanks for the review, Justine!"
2025-03-13,I love my new iPhone 16e! I got the white one 256 GB
2025-03-06,"People think iPhone SE is for poor people, but, believe it or not, I've encountered an executive who had iPhone 6s that looked like it got run over by a monster truck!"
2025-02-25,"That 2x is really optical man,look at the switch betwwen 1x and 2x"
2025-02-25,I don't know how much zoom can be used?
2025-03-06,"Everyone talks about megapixels, operating systems, and camera specs when a new smartphone drops, but in reality, most of us just share pictures and videos through messaging and social media. If you send a photo from an iPhone to another iPhone, it looks great. The same goes for Samsung-to-Samsung via RCS. But what really matters is how well photos and videos hold up when sent across different messaging platforms like iMessage, RCS, or even through social media apps. So, I have a question: Which phone actually delivers the best image and video quality when shared over messaging and social media? Since that’s how we all view and exchange content, I’d love to see a video comparison on this!"
2025-03-06,Why doesn’t it have the Dynamic Island
2025-02-25,How is the iPhone 16 s is?
2025-03-06,"I’ve had MagSafe since the iPhone 12 Pro Max. The lack of that feature on this phone is enough itself to keep me from buying it. If you have an iPhone 15 series, I would stay away from this phone."
2025-02-25,"Au$1000 in Australia 
Definitely not a budget phone with so many missing features."
2025-03-13,"It's never a review, it's always an Apple ad.  iJustine manages to avoid all of the Apple's nonsense in her ""review"" somehow."
2025-03-13,Does anyone know what shoes she’s wearing at the end??
2025-02-25,It's weird to see a brand new iPhone with one camera.
2025-02-25,A huge ripoff
2025-03-06,This is how they get away with selling less for more
2025-03-06,I don't think someone would want to switch to iphone from android with 600 dollar budget...you can get much better androids at that price
2025-03-06,30fps was the right choice for a phone camera review!  Excellent!
2025-02-25,You're better off just buying last years Pro models
2025-03-06,"$599 is prefect price for normal user! 100% all of the kid and 100% older people! The people in the between that don't care about 3 Camera system, and Magsafe its money saver!"
2025-02-25,this reminds me iPhone Xr
2025-02-25,It doesn't have wireless charging unless i use a case what i do have standard on my iphone 12. I will wait another year i think.
2025-03-06,"Honest review, good amount of info you only 5 minutes. I'm a Pixel type but if I was into iPhone or considering switching this might make me think about it. Presentation is everything and she didn't push it on everyone with less etc, she said there's shortcomings but that it still might be worth it for some and the best way to find out is go into an Apple store yourself. That's pretty straightforward and though I'm happy with my Pixel 8 Pro, this was enjoyable to watch for that and yes, it simply popped up on my feed and I've some free time and watching other various videos as well."
2025-03-06,Disclaimer – This video has been made by an Apple employee.
2025-03-06,""" you scuba"" hahah very nice goodstuff thanks."
2025-02-25,It seems she gets excited easily..
2025-03-13,your channel is an AD channel. This is not a review....you are blonde !
2025-02-25,Under 600 bucks...599$.
2025-03-06,"Why isn’t it called 14e? It doesn’t look like the 16 lineup?
It is the (e)xpensive 14 version. It’s like a resurrection that wants to squeeze itself with the 16 line up."
2025-03-06,All this needs is a giveaway
2025-03-06,wow thank u 4 zoom recording
2025-03-06,Apple needs a iPhone mini pro that would make bank!!! With all the bells and whistles
2025-03-06,"It's the ""or someone switching from Android"" that gets me... Who the flying flip wants a Fiat with a V12 engine, no seatbelt, no brakes, no seat and no steering wheel? Essentially that's what this is, a fast chip and AI, but that's it! We might be poor but we ain't stupid, A mid range Android kills this crap without even trying."
2025-03-06,LOST OMG ...so many old memories..the best show ever made by mankind
2025-03-06,They should have made one in cream orange that would have been cool
2025-03-06,I feel like we won't see an Apple modem in the Pro line of iPhones until the C3 Apple modem comes out
2025-03-06,Why isn't Justine an Apple Fellow or someone on the Leadership team already?
2025-03-06,"I just entered the world of Airtags 2 weeks ago, so it not having the Airtag precision find or whatever it's called is lame :(

 What exactly will it not do with the airtag that my current iphone does do?"
2025-02-25,"Woah this is surreal because I am a huge lost fan and I’m on my second rewatch! I was watching it some hours ago that and I had a feeling the island had to do something with Lost! Nowadays I didn’t think anyone would mention lost so I was even more shook, by the way great video Justine I love your editing!"
2025-02-25,My old iPhone XR 128gb is getting long in the tooth and I was thinking about upgrading without paying an arm and a leg. Would this be a good option or maybe older iPhone 14 or 15 in the same price range?
2025-02-25,It's a crime you haven't seen all the movies. They literally just announced another one.
2025-03-06,"Does the 16e come with a case? As in… with the other iPhones there would be a case in the box, is it the same with the 16e?"
2025-03-06,Glad Justine admitted that you'll be fine without the camera control button. Apple needs to remove that next year and do something more useful
2025-02-25,Im still waiting for any dinosaur to chase you
6  ago,Ahhhhhh it’s the hydrogen bomb cage from Lost season 5!!! 2:39
2025-02-25,Probably the shortest review ever by Justine haha. Love your aura <3
2025-02-25,wow changing up your video style i like it
2025-02-25,Nice video iJ!
2025-02-25,After years and years of being subscribed I guess I’m off.   We need an unbiased review not an advert for it.
2025-02-25,I Didn't Understand Why This Existing!
2025-03-13,Nicely explained
2025-02-25,"Apple’s tech has been more and more lackluster over the years. For the money these devices should all include a centerstage front facing camera along with 4K resolution. The return of the landscape home screen option, 120hz refresh rate across all devices etc. Also with the MacBook Airs they should offer no gimmicky workarounds for supporting dual monitors."
2025-03-06,Powerful performance and affordable price
2025-02-25,When 17 come in September it will priced 499$ so good deal
2025-03-06,I went to Hawaii in 2021. Kualoa Ranch was fun.
2025-02-25,Thankkk youuu  I need this video
2025-02-25,"Everything is perfect for every single product you promote, just pay money to buy, that's it"
2025-03-06,"Only one camera, 60hz screen! In 2025!"
2025-02-25,11 minutes I love you Justine!!!
2025-03-13,"It's okay to say you don't like an apple product, Justine."
2025-03-06,Is it true its using the same camera sensor as 16 pro on ultrawide? If its true the phone is even worse then u taught.
2025-02-25,"It’s a shame that you had to get political. Not only that but make a comment on an edited Clip of Elon and his son. Yet The entire video shows that Elon made sure his son was okay. You hate Elon yet you drive a Cyber Truck. You make your living on Reviewing Apple products, but did you know that Tim Cook personally donated 1 million dollars to President Trump’s
Campaign? Why not comment on that? Now Apple is making a 500 billion dollar investment in America and creating jobs here vs in China. You drive a Tesla but you hate Elon. If you were a republican you would have been Cancelled already. The hypocrisy is astounding."
2025-03-06,I feel like people should vlog and make videos more with their phones to get the most out of them
2025-03-06,Is this a 'i am paid by Apple' ad?
2025-02-25,"why is this an ad? what happened Justine, really used to love watching your videos but now they have become a blatant commercial for apple :("
2025-02-25,early gang
2025-03-06,"She's always been biased with apple products.. Reason why she has ""i"" in iJustine.."
2025-02-25,For shame that you haven’t seen all the jurassic Park movies
2025-02-25,"I was using an Android, which is a pro level device."
2025-03-06,Great Apple Justine!!!
2025-03-06,Apple going off the rails recently.
2025-02-25,Welcome to Jurassic park
2025-03-06,I was all set to get the new iPhone but it's too expensive for me. I just wanted a budget iPhone to replace my SE. I don't care about Apple AI and having no magsafe on a 2025 iPhone is crazy.
2025-02-25,Mag safe big let down
2025-02-25,This is so awesome
2025-03-13,"Justine. Your reviews are just not objective at all. You try to be honest by not trashing the product. I don’t like it. Stop being a hypocrite and say was everybody knows, this phone is a joke, it’s you be 399 at most. 599 is still far too expensive for what you get. I just unsubscribed. Bye and best of luck."
2025-03-06,Don’t even try and suggest that this is a good buy. Not when you can get 15 Pro for the same price.
2025-02-25,I like the anaglyph filter
2025-02-25,"hahah you guys, I forgot to change the title of the video hahahahahahah"
2025-03-06,Should at least come with a 120hz display for $899.99 Canadian. Another year I keep my 13 Pro Max is fine with me!
6  ago,Ordered yesterday
2025-02-25,Wow That’s Very Cool
2025-03-06,This a ad for a camera?
2025-02-25,Is there difference between Review And AD ?
2025-02-25,Sheesh the camera
2025-03-06,"Jurassic Park or Jurassic World?

Thank you for the review!"
2025-03-06,"Under Steve Jobs Apple used to innovate , it sucks the direction Apple has taken under Tim Cook’s leadership, particularly when it comes to innovation. While Steve Jobs was known for pushing boundaries with game changing products, Apple is now more focused on profit than true technological advancement. Apple is recycling old designs for financial gain rather than innovating. I have to keep it Real.️"
2025-03-06,The park tour was fun. But the iphone ad was really long…
2025-02-25,This is the buy your parents an iPhone because they don't care about all the missing stuff pretty much! Thanks for mentioning the missing stuff without crashing out not what reviews should be about just the basics.
2025-03-06,"Think people forget she gets invited EXCLUSIVELY to Apple events…. This is clearly an ad for Apple not a review, FIX YOUR TITLE!!!"
2025-03-13,New iPhone 17 mini needed to be launched

2025-02-25,I love your videos
8  ago,Please do a unboxing video.

2025-02-25,"i want that iphone e too, cuz i never have the SE's before!"
2025-02-25,Should have been 500 dollars. Not worth it
2025-03-06,Do more videos with Joey
2025-03-06,don’t know if this is an ad… but surely this isn’t a review 🫠
2025-03-06,IJustine I think it's time to retire....
2025-02-25,JUST-INe - BEAUTY WITHOUT BRAIN
2025-02-25,I'm using an iPhone 11 and I want a vfm upgrade and it seems like the only cheap option is the 13 which is already old
2025-02-25,I'm still rocking an iPhone 3G lol
2025-02-25,Nice detailed review. The trip to Hawaii was a nice touch
2025-02-25,love your vids justine. been here since 2018
2025-03-06,Im a iPhone 15 pro user . Next Phone galaxy S series !
2025-02-25,"I love your videos,Justine."
2025-02-25,3:05 pic looked very flip phone pixel mhmmmm why.. id get a 16
2025-03-06,Please  make another  video of the actual  review stop being an apple marketer
2025-03-06,"Ugh, are all YouTube 'reviews' just ads now. So sad..."
2025-03-06,"it’s definitely got a great camera, still think it’s overpriced"
2025-02-25,Great review
2025-03-06,I love your reviews xooxx
2025-02-25,"The proof that Apple is happy to turn their back on the 10% of users who can’t use OLED due to PWM.
Apple, the Xr proved the cheaper LCD iPhone would sell well. Come on!"
2025-02-25,Crazy
2025-03-06,BEAUTIFUL
2025-02-25,I have a feeling she's gonna love it like OMG
2025-02-25,Good phone just odd timing. If Apple would have waited a year and dropped a 17E in the spring of 2026 with a then year old A18 for $499-$549 people would be going nuts for it.
2025-03-06,“Review”
2025-03-06,
2025-02-25,She would fit very well into Apple culture and work environment.
2025-03-06,"Maybe she is just very good looking, I don't know why the selfie camera looks better than I expected. Maybe its the natural lighting."
2025-03-06,Why no unboxing :(
2025-03-06,Wow…even iPhone content is lacking now…just zero effort now huh?
2025-02-25,"I""m watching this in 4k. Footage looks great."
2025-02-25,Miss ur vlogs smm
2025-03-06,review or long commercial ?
2025-02-25,"Justine, your on Oahu a ton! I’d love to catch you in the wild. Did you get to go secret beach in Waimanalo? It may or may not be in front of you know who’s house.  Check out and eat at Senia!"
2025-02-25,$599 is too expensive to replace the previous SE 2022. It should have been max $499. Gouging Apple always looking to gouge.
2025-02-25,"Should I buy a Sony ZV-e10 or an iPhone 16e. I make TikTok’s and I have an iPhone 15 and a Nikon D5100, or should I stay with what I have?"

2025-03-06,"A really wonderful phone, I think it will become legendary!"
2025-02-25,The C1 modem is subpar.
2025-03-06,This is why they stopped selling the iPhone mini.
2025-02-25,cool
2025-02-25,nice apple ad. lol
2025-02-25,the best & most honest apple reviews.
2025-02-25,"The iPhone 16e has me convinced....to keep my iPhone 11 until ""A-Grade"" iPhone 15 Pros become available on the reputable Refurb/Re-sale market for $500-ish.  I do think Apple missed the mark...600 American Freedom Eagles is not the sweet spot for any entry-level smartphone in the current marketplace."
2025-02-25,Not bad at all!
9  ago,Every other reviewer has said it's complete garbage..
2025-02-25,Good video
2025-03-06,Woow!!!
2025-02-25,"Question: If I lose my airpods, does Find My work on it?"
2025-03-06,Still a decent phone but not budget
2025-02-25,Rather Buy Ip 15 Then this new 16e
4  ago,I don’t like because one the main thing is not included on this called Cynematic

2025-03-13,Who follows her just because she’s hot?
2025-03-06,3:38 you removed something that was not even a distraction in the first place. It was so small

2025-03-06,Tim cook is cooked with this one
2025-03-06,This is 1st gen photographic style not the new one
2025-03-06,Who's watching this because they're too poor to afford Apple's newest iPhone?
2025-02-25,"Nah.. get a refurbished 15pro at the same price. Or wait a few months and get the 16 new at around the same price at deals! 

This phone makes no sense at 600$"
2025-03-06,people crying in comments that a perosn who is a fan of apple likes a product by them BE SERIOUS !
2025-03-06,"I LOVE Justine, and I know she's in partnership with Apple, but... Nobody needed this iPhone."
2025-02-25,Processor how it is
2025-03-06,Most people around the World  who have an iPhone have photos dating back as far as the YEAR 2023 ONLY
2025-03-06,Iphone 16e cost 705$ here in  India for a single camera and the display that stick to 60hrz  not worth it.
2025-02-25,this is a work phone or for senior people. If someone cares about camera or magsafe or screen quality shouldn't buy this.
2025-03-06,It’s an ad  not a review. Fangirl moment
2025-02-25,That's a nice phone
2025-03-06,Starts at $760 here in ireland from the apple store. No thanks.....
2025-03-06,400$ is a fair price for phone like iphone 16e
2025-03-06,Camera doesn’t look good. Price is way too much. This iPhone is not for anyone. It’s going to flop. That price point is crazy.
2025-02-25,The best phone reviewer
2025-03-06,Let's all admit it. It's $100 too expensive.
2025-03-06,damn once again apple launched a new old phone
2025-03-06,"Even if Apple releases human poop, iJustine will say it's nice. Seriously, either iJustine is a secret employee of Apple or she has no brains. This kind of brand addiction is not good for your audience. You know 16e is a shit phone, why sugar coat it? Unsubscribed!"
2025-02-25,"Great video! 
I am so excited for the  iPhone 16e!
Thanks you ijustine!"
9  ago,How can you recommend this phone ? That’s insane
2025-02-25,Hahaha wow an iPhone XR rebranded how innovative
2025-02-25,בהצלחה
2025-02-25,Loved your video!! You should use the 16e as your main phone
2025-02-25,Not a review. This is an AD. Lol.
2025-03-06,iJustine is the Fox News of Apple! Propaganda in chief.
2025-02-25,"i dont understand why people don't realise that the 16e is supposed to be a low end phone, not something rivalling the 16 and the recent phones. its not supposed to be outstanding, its supposed to be more affordable (yes its expensive but not nearly as expensive as the pros) with lower end specs. i think this video was actually very insightful and you pointed out the cons of this phone along with the pros. thankyou justine for such an honest review, ur the best! <3"
2025-02-25,Get my new iPhone 16 E on Friday good video hi from uk
10  ago,Really iJustine you've sold out
2025-03-06,"Is it worth it? No, saved you 5 minutes. Also, it's not under 600$ after taxes and a case, it's 650$ plus..."
2025-03-06,Notch!? No thank you!
2025-02-25,You made Tim Apple happy. It’s an ad
2025-02-25,Looks like a 4s

2025-03-06,magsafe is a big miss
2025-02-25,I am thinking of getting it but idk right now I have the iPhone 14Pro and I am not willing to spend over $1k on a phone.
5  ago,I don't think she REALLY liked the phone.
2025-02-25,"If anyone thinks this phone is worth it you’re delusional, you’re better off getting a 15 pro"
2025-02-25,"good for you Justine, but this unboxing is one of the most boring of all iPhone history, not for you but the phone :/"
2025-02-25,Litt

2025-03-06,@iJustine what metal band you rocking with the Ultra 2?
2025-03-06,I’m curious..is she not allowed to speak bad about apple products?
2025-03-06,"Nice review always, but the skin tone is a bit off"
2025-02-25,woah
2025-02-25,The iPhone 16e is not worth $600.
2025-03-06,"It’s an iPhone under 600…
Technically yes but…"
2025-03-06,Ship 1 phone to India
2025-03-06,This is a garbage phone for too much money.

2025-03-06,"Switching from midrange android to this , is a downgrade"
2025-03-06,Extremely disappointed with the design
2025-02-25,Hii Justine!!
2025-02-25,Waaaay too pricey for a budget iPhone with only has 128 gb.  Better buy a refurbished or an iPhone from some gens back.
2025-02-25,But only display 6.1
2025-03-06,Incredible BS. Who watching this
2025-03-06,It reminds me of the iphone 4 if i see the back and i love it
2025-02-25,For me your review is better than an Apple ad. Keep doing it !! I like ur videos.
2025-03-06,Wth
2025-02-25,This felt like an ai commercial
2025-02-25,What is this bootlicking for apple?
2025-02-25,Simply no longer a value proposition and if you are buying this phone because it will get apple intelligence then you deserve what you get.
2025-03-06,Watching this video on my samsung galaxy a15 ...
2025-02-25,I love Steve jobs I love apple  think different 🇮🇳
2025-02-25,You could care less about this phone.
2025-02-25,clearly not an objective review. go and se the MKBHD one. no sense 599
2025-02-25,hi ijustine i am a huge fan for years. Thank you.
2025-02-25,oh god
2025-03-13,It’s nice
2025-02-25,Iphone 16e doesn't have photograph styles and does are normal 3:24 3:24 3:24

2025-03-06,"iPhone si boring now, i have been 10 years with iPhone and feels just the same, oppo find n5 is something new, an Android that i want to change from iPhone, finally…"
2025-03-06,iJustine flies to Hawaii and scuba dives to answer the million-dollar question> who is this iPhone for?
2025-02-25,Great content Justine. The 16e is a failed product. For about $30 more one can buy a refurbished Iphone 15 pro. Way better phone for the money.
2025-03-06,I dont believe anything what she say about this phone
2025-02-25,"""Upgrading from Android"" 
Every Android i can buy for 599$ will be an Upgrade to this"
2025-03-06,Thank you for not being negative. I love your videos
2025-02-25,£50-100to much and no mag safe really
2025-03-06,Hey Justine just you've been in 2 videos with Rosanna in last 2 weeks just watch out continuing doing collabs as drama.. just saying cause I like you always I might delete this later
2025-03-06,"128 gigabytes for 599? No thanks, I'll stick to buying budget Android phones, thanks. And this phone only has a 60hz screen at that price. Plus only one camera. Freaking ridiculous Apple. You are a crappy company. Budget Android phones give you much more value for money for less than 599."
2025-03-06,"No thanks, Imma stick to my Samsung"
2025-03-06,Seems like you're not as excited as the other iphone 16 line up  if only this was priced for 399 it would be a good deal but lacking for alot of iphone features for 599 is too much plus it is only 128gb and 60hz.
11  ago,this video looks so fake and ai generated she either did not care about this or she just got super lazy and was like i need to rush this review so i can get my check. cause this is so not like her. home gurl is hurting and it shows !
2025-02-25,Im huge in the pants
2025-02-25,Hi
2025-03-06,A ad
2025-03-06,Still the same useless front camera poor quality in low light video
2025-02-25,Nobody should buy this. Apple really messed up on this phone. Could get a 15 pro for around the same price now.

2025-02-25,"Justine, from your experience with the battery life, do you reckon if they put the new modem in a pro iPhone we will get massive battery life savings? I think we need a battery test vs the previous gen to see how much more we are getting in real life whilst doing the same tasks then we can extrapolate that to the pro phones."

2025-03-06,"People who're criticising ijustine for this review.

Give me one android phone under 600 usd that can click pictures and videos as good as iphone 16e. I'll wait. 

No phone is perfect. Yes this phone has some glaring misses too. But Apple has come up with a device that gets the basics right at a relatively affordable price point. 

'e' stands for essential, as I understand. 

120 HZ -> NOT essential. 
Magsafe -> NOT essential.
Ultrawide camera -> NOT essential. 
UWB -> NOT essential

Best in class modem for great network reception -> ESSENTIAL
Excellent Battery life -> ESSENTIAL

So called Tech nerds will never understand this because they have no clue what the masses really want. 

Apple knows it."
2025-02-25,"600 dollars 
how funny stupid"
2025-03-06,Not worth for the money this girl bias IPHONE LOVER

2025-03-06,Justine its so good to see you and one of your videos again. Seems like youre doing pretty great still! Sending lots of positive energy your way! <3 (every time i come across your videos randomly throughout the years i just remember those good ass times watching you and joey play minecraft... like getting my lunch or dinner and hopping over to my computer putting on the new vid yall 2 just put out. thank you for all those wonderful fun times)

2025-03-06,"At the end of the video, she says, “visit the Apple Store “. I’m guessing she will be there, behind the counter, with an Apple t-shirt on, serving customers."
2025-02-25,nobody needs this thing.
2025-03-06,"Hey Justine, I've always been a fan of the channel. But I really can't understand why you name your Apple product videos as ""reviews"", I think it's really misleading to the consumers. You know, I know, everyone knows it's almost like a straight up commercial for Apple. There's never a negative review for Apple, and even for a product as bad in value as the 16e, there still isn't. I don't mind you putting out a video and showing your support for Apple, but labelling it as a ""review"" just seems very misleading, to someone who's genuinely looking to buy the best phone for themselves."
2025-03-06,"This is such a great video all around, Thank You"
2025-02-25,"Who goes to Oahu and Kualoa ranch to review a phone? lol must be nice. Also, the original Jurassic park only had one scene filmed there. The rest of the outdoor tropical scenes were filmed on Kauai"

2025-02-25,"Definitely no worth it a camera phone with 1 camera at 2025, are joke apple with $599"

2025-03-06,No iPhone SE series was a budget friendly phone at $399 and now apple wants to charge $200 more. That's a big no!
