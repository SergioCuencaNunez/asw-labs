2023-04-06,"Thanks for the review.

Having tried a lot of things as I can see, do you have a recommendation for buying a VR headset right now for DCS / MSFS / flight sims specifically?"
2023-04-06,"Thanks for the write-up. I am a bit sad to hear that the XR sucks because it will almost certainly lead to HTC quitting the VR space. While you could argue that it wouldn't be a huge loss since there headsets are simply outclassed by other offerings, to me it feels like it would increase the likelyhood of the death of (PC)VR (currently creeping over the horizon).

I really hoped that HTC would get their shit together and produce a headset that is competitive but it seems they can't quite keep up. I find the way that HTC seems to react to customer problems very concerning, it really adds to the impression that they're on the way out.

Funnily enough, I am one of the people with a ""VR-port"" on my 2070 Super, and I find it quite funny that it becomes relevant now, years after the consortium and all manufacturers abandoned the standard.

My one question to you would be, how does the FOV compare to the Quest 2?"
2023-04-06,"Thanks for the write up. It’s been quite a long time since I had any interest in VR at all. I’d owned the DK2 and latter the CV1, and while I thought both showed some promise, neither were a satisfying enough experience to keep me in VR. A month or so ago I caught Mark from SimHanger’s review of the Pico 4. It was a favorable review and got me thinking that the reasons I left VR, poor resolution, uncomfortable headsets, and lack of pass through, may have been addressed. 

This led to some disappointment when I learned that the Pico 4 was not officially available in the US, so I started looking for other options. The Vive XR Elite seemed to check all the same boxes, and while significantly more expensive than the Pico 4, I was sold on features the Pico 4 didn’t have like adjustable diopters and the ability to wear the HMD in glasses mode. So, I placed a preorder in early March, and started keeping an eye out for early reviews.  Initially the reviews I found were positive but as preorders started ending up in the hands users the outlook quickly changed form positive, to one of meh at best to Vive dropped the ball on this one.

 I canceled my xr preorder last week, and to their credit Vive quickly issued me a refund. Taking another look at options I reasoned that I can purchase prescription inserts easily enough so the XR’s adjustable diopters were not that big of a deal. In the end I decided to go with a grey market Pico 4 and I’m just waiting on the prescription inserts to show up before I do any real testing."
2024-08-26,"It’s been a year and has had some time for the xr elite to marinate. Have any of your opinions changed???
I’m getting an xr elite tomorrow I got a pretty sweet deal because it came with two wrist trackers and the full face tracker and it’ll be my first dive in to face tracking so I’m looking forward to that. (I mainly got it because I’ve been trying to avoid vive for so long but ever since I got vive trackers i fell into all their weird and unique accessories and hmd’s so I just decided to collect all their headsets lol)"
2023-04-06,You can always rely on HTC to drop the ball. Their last good headset was the Vive Pro.
2023-04-10,How did you get it to play DCS?  Did you play through steam?  I'm trying to get the DCS launcher to see the XR... Suggestions?
2023-05-03,"As someone with a thunderbolt 4 port on my desktop I'm thankful, I want to try using it wired, is the dimming issue a low pd thing or a software quirk?"
2023-11-14,Hey thank you for the review! Are you still using the headset? Any new insight?
2023-11-30,Sad to see this was the outlook at release. HTC really should have let people know they need a thunderbolt port on the motherboard or as a pcie extension for the headset to function properly. Side note they have released dev updates nearly twice a month consistently since release and have ironed out almost every issue people had at release. It genuinely is an amazing headset when you have the proper hardware to run it. Also if you get a vr cover replacement for the terrible face cover it also really heightens the fov and makes it way more comfortable in glasses mode.
2023-12-18,"I only purchased this HMD for developing MR, but was completely disappointed by the MR interface. The passthrough is awful and there are no options. Everything is dark and yellowish color, lots of glare and the passthrough is flat, almost completely flat. It's horrendous, I put it right back in the box and started a return request. HTC lied their XR is nowhere near the quality they claim. This HMD was a total rip off - HTC's XR is a gimmick. Will be a long time before I have faith in them again."
2024-03-04,Well that eliminates any consideration of buying one of these. Thanks for the in depth review. BTW thank God for text reader apps to read all that!
2023-04-06,"You're welcome! 

Entry level / all arounder

So if you currently don't have one, or never used VR the Quest 2 is a really great all arounder, and if the Wireless Airlink feature is as good on the Q2 as the Pro, it's really come a long way and is acceptable enough to use without compromising too much clarity, as long as you have a 5ghz network to run it off of.

Best for just seated simming

The G2 is another option, arguably the best for just simming but there are a few external factors you should be aware of.  At this stage of its lifecycle, it's really hard for me to recommend it at $599, it does go on sale though. There is one big asterisk with the G2, and that is that the cable is prone to failure, even the V2 (redesigned) one. This isn't so bad, except that HP wants $189 for the cable alone.

I suppose if you buy a 'fresh' one on sale, you will still get a years worth of warranty and at $299 or $399, for just DCS / MSFS it'd get the nod over the Quest 2 from me as long as you are comfortable with what I said about the cable.

Yolo option

If cost is no factor and you do want the all-around best, surprisingly it is the Quest Pro to me. I really didn't expect it to be the case, but after buying it to compare to the XR elite I'm going to keep it. I will say in this bucket of HMDs are ones like the Varo Aero, which I don't have any experience with but may be 'better' if cost is no object.  Like I said in the review, the display is mind blowing, but if you haven't seen it you don't know what you're missing. I imagine much of the goodies from the Quest Pro will trickle down to the Quest 3, which is positioned to be the general consumer grade one.

I was honestly shocked at how good the Pro was for gaming/general VR use given how it's positioned as a 'business product,' and why I never intended on buying one.  It was actually [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC-UQHDjf5c&ab_channel=LukasS.%2FWolta) from Lukas S. Wolta that even gave me the idea to buy a QPro off Amazon to benchmark.

&#x200B;

edit: something got messed up with formatting."
2023-04-06,"I'm also going to recommend the quest 2. I can't stand meta as a company, but I have to recognize they've absolutely knocked it out the park. 

It's comfortable, and the picture quality / fov / frame rate is great. And for the price, it's really very impressive. You have to pay an awful lot more to get better performance. 

I also really enjoy it as a stand alone device."
2023-04-06,">Thanks for the write-up. I am a bit sad to hear that the XR sucks because it will almost certainly lead to HTC quitting the VR space

Same, I really thought they had a winner from the media coverage on this. Like you said, this might be the last hurrah for them, and it is a shame since competition, as we all know is good. 

&#x200B;

>I find the way that HTC seems to react to customer problems very concerning

That is a big reason I took the time to do this. The MUCH shorter version I had posted to the HTC forums was out of concern the admittedly anecdotal amount of folks insta-returning this or having day 1 issues that should have been ironed out two generations ago is concerning. I think of Samsung / Google and how they will only try for so long, and just give up and move on. This is an expensive product, and I am legitimately concerned a lot of folks will be left in the dust on this based on early impressions. Granted, the only point of comparison I have is other product launches, and I can't say I've seen something turn so quickly once it got into consumers hands. 

&#x200B;

>My one question to you would be, how does the FOV compare to the Quest 2?

Simple answer: It feels like it's better than it actually is on paper

Longer answer: This is tough, for the reasons u/rapierarch said, but from reading your response you're well aware it's relative. To me, FOV much like the display is more than just the on-paper specs. Like any headset, if you pay attention you're aware you're missing the peripheral vision. This one is no different, but what IS different is that when this or any HMD really nails the immersion you kind of melt into the experience and don't notice it. Currently, just due to the Pro's rubber gasket add-ons there is more visibility out of the bottom than on the Q2, I actually like this because I can kind of 'turn off' noticing it when playing DCS, but it's handy if I want to peak out the bottom to hit a switch or whatnot. 

Like I said in the review above, the Vive XR for example feels much more narrow than the Quest Pro, even though it isn't - but that has a lot to do with the perceived vertical limitations. When I moved from the Index to the G2, the FOV difference was noticeable and took time to get used to. Going from the Quest 2 / G2 to the Pro, it didn't jump out to me as bad, kind of good but I do think that has more to do with the display vs the physical FOV."
2023-04-06,"> how does the FOV compare to the Quest 2?

That's irrelevant actually. Fov also depends heavily on how the headset fits on each person. For example Q2 and G2 actually have almost identical FOV but people complain about Q2 is like wearing a scuba mask and G2 has wonderful FOV. It depends on person to person."
2023-05-05,">I find the way that HTC seems to react to customer problems very concerning, it really adds to the impression that they're on the way out.

HTC has a discord where it seems like the support team is pretty receptive to people's comments and feedback. Where did you get this impression? Just curious!"
2023-04-06,">The Vive XR Elite seemed to check all the same boxes

This is exactly why I was so excited and summarily disappointed. One of my biggest issues with comfort is how much pressure most of these HMDs put on your nose without aftermarket accessories (like counterweights). This is really why the glasses mode was such a buzz kill. 

Ironically, the Quest Pro doesn't put any pressure on my nose, but if the general consensus seems to be that the Qpro is not comfortable, my experience was different but my assumption is I'm the exception not the rule here so I didn't really touch on it much. 

I also saw the tide change just as you described but remained positive, since my use case was really niche (replacing the G2), and well you can read the rest above :) 

Glad you had a good experience with the cancellation. The return process was \*almost\* infuriating as it was just like, ""Ok, mail it back here \_\_\_\_\_"" No label, no nothing. But I did get a follow-up email from HTC providing one, so they stuck the landing so to speak."
2024-08-26,"Dunno I returned it shortly after I wrote that. I would say anything under the 'bad but fixable' section could have been fixed, some probably would be weird if they haven't yet. 

If you haven't used VR yet, or coming from a much older HMD a lot of things that annoyed me you probably won't notice as much. 

I also bought it during the presale period so I was extra annoyed because it was over $1000 so I was a bit more harsh with that in mind, comparing it to the Quest Pro and 3. The comparison between it and the Quest 3 was the most mind boggling. 

If they cleaned up the streaming some, you got a good deal and it's hopefully comfortable on your head im sure you will enjoy it."
2023-04-10,"You kind of have to, that is the only way to do it with the vive streaming software."
2023-05-03,Almost 100% the PD issue because if you daisy chain the HMD to the battery then to PC it's fine.
2023-05-03,"I think you did say the dimming was related to regular usb c output vs pd, also wanted to ask if your experience using virtual desktop to stream was more reliable than the regular streaming software"
2023-11-14,"No I returned it shortly after that review. It seems like it's kinda DOA at this point, nobody is even talking about it anymore.

While I also passed on the Big screen HMD, I think that might be the most similar depending on what it was that attracted you to the HMD in the first place."
2023-12-31,Did you test in DCS?
2023-04-06,"Awesome summary, thanks.

I was going to go for the G2, I really don't feel alright with paying 1k+ for a Meta product. 

I am wary of how closely tied it is with their ""ecosystem"" and I want to get myself far from Facebook. Is there a way to use it without tying it to my Facebook account?"
2023-05-16,That same review from Lukas got me to buy a QPro!
2023-05-29,I wish amazon offered a payment plan for quest pro id buy it
2023-04-06,"I wouldn't call it irrelevant. It is subjective, so I was asking for their personal experience e.g. how they percieve the Q2 versus the XR/QPro. For me, I can see the display edges while wearing the Q2, which is what I would call a narrow FOV and is the reason why I am looking to other headsets."
2023-04-10,crap!  That is a real fly in my ointment! The Steam and the DCS launcher aren't compatible.
2023-05-03,We're you able to try out if the virtual desktop streaming is better than the stock software? I've been trying to see if that software release addresses that but haven't been able to find much info
2023-04-14,You no longer need a Facebook account to use the Quest
2023-05-29,What you think?? Im debating a quest pro but the quest 3 is so close!
2023-04-06,"That's what I meant it is irrelevant because it is subjective fitting issue.

You have 2 possibilities. Go with factory values and order headsets with ultra wide fov. Varjo and Pimax will give you that.

Or order online all standard fov headsets and try which one fits you best.

I have no problems with Fov of Q2, but me saying this is irrelevant because it will not change how it fits on your face."
2023-05-03,"Nope I returned it shortly after I wrote that. I imagine if it's gotten to the app store it's going to be better, VD is awesome for other HMDs."
2023-04-14,"Yeah, I looked it up in the meantime, thanks. Just ordered a Pro with the current discount.

I have a feeling I'll be stuck to DCS for the foreseeable future."
2023-12-18,Does that include developing for the Quest? I want to use and developer for the Quest but I don't want to be a facebooker.
2023-05-31,"If you have cash why wait?

If you don't have cash, then *probably* wait."
2023-12-19,"I'm sorry, I don't know"
2024-01-05,"It's technically a meta account, which isn't directly a facebook account. https://developer.oculus.com/sign-up/"
2023-03-15,"XR Elite owner too, much the same as you, including Quest 2 and 8kx.

Fov is too small, particularly vertically, I feel half my downward vision is cut out.

Not that comfy for me either.

There are pros and cons but the cons are too much. I won't keep it.

I've had a Pro at the higher price, and that's better on almost every way, and now that it's even cheaper than the XR, it's really a no brainer if you're looking for something like that."
2023-03-15,"Dang. I was excited for this one, but the scuba goggles effect is something I can’t invest in for my next headset. I keep waiting on upgrading from Q2 because I need a substantial upgrade in FOV. I’m even worried the Q3 will not be the FOV increase we all want. Stay patient y’all."
2023-03-15,"Can you test one thing for me when you have a chance? How accurate is the 3D depth on the pass through? If you walk around and grab things does your hand land right on them? Do you feel as though you're walking through a perfectly scaled room or does it feel off at all?

This is the one thing that really hits home on the Quest Pro but all other headset so far are struggling with. When you reach for a fork on a plate while wearing the Quest Pro, you land on the fork exactly as though you're not looking through a headset. You can walk around with it and you don't feel any difference in your balance and don't worry you're going to bump into anything because of inaccuracy. 

I really want a higher resolution pass through but, I keep hearing rumors that the reason for the low resolution is the depth accuracy.  The XR2 can't do both high resolution and a depth accurate picture."
2023-03-15,"I have had this preordered since right after CES, still waiting on shipping notification (north America so now im guessing closer to the end of the month).

Personally im an anti-Meta/Facebook and anti-TikTok/ByteDance person, so there really arent a lot of options for me anymore; im mainly going to be using this as a PCVR headset, so the Index is an option BUT im really into Inside-Out tracking after previously trying an Oculus S; (i have room for the sensors in my office, but kinda a pain when i want to transition to another room, too much setup time)  


In your opinion Index or this?  Also when you say the store isnt very populated, if I were (in theory) to have my XR Elite, and subscribe to the Viveport service, would there still be a lack of content dedicated to the headset?"
2023-03-15,"""The Ring Controllers destroy the just put it in your pocket use case-""

It has hand tracking, fyi, works pretty well in environments with decent lighting. Hand tracking is definitely going to be a big part of consumer VR."
2023-03-15,"I had two pre orders, cancelled the one from their website and keeping the amazon one. Easy returns if needed."
2023-03-16,[deleted]
2023-03-15,"Thanks for your notes!  I'm still waiting for mine to arrive (no early one for me).  I'm upgrading from the OG Quest, so I'm hoping that everything will be an improvement for me!"
2023-03-15,So far first impressions have not been good apart from 1 youtuber who runs a drone channel.  Mine still hasn't shipped :(
2023-03-15,"Re: Binoculars effect-this really bothered me when I first got the Quest 2 (my first VR headset)-and while, as many people claimed that you forget about it once you start playing, I can't say I ever forgot about it, but it did just bother me less as time went on. 

Using the Quest Pro, even with the full Light Blockers, really feels  less Binocular-esque from the start. Its still there, just not \*there\* there."
2023-03-16,Quest Pro... Damm screan is good.. Asgards wrath looked like a completely New game. Finally a game looks like it should in vr. Couldn't ask for more. Fov is also better then quest 2. Only see a little bit of the corners of the glasses... Controllerers great. This should have come with the xr elite. Making it super portable
2023-03-15,"One question, does it have that stupid amber glow as the Quest Pro does? If it doesn't then I know which one I'm getting. It's only $100 difference here in the states.

&#x200B;

Edit: Want to iterate that I don't plan on purchasing the Quest Pro again. Great clarity, shit amber IPS glow for that money isn't worth it. I'll just keep on waiting."
2023-03-15,so basically this is a very expensive set of VR goggles with the added bonus of playing wireless PCVR and stand alone games.  Bummer
2023-03-15,Not sure why people would be the XR over the BigScreens TBH.  Other than XR is available now.
2023-03-15,Can't wait for mine to arrive.  Sold my G2 over a month ago and I've really been craving VR.  My order still says processing 😭
2023-03-15,What would be the experience of upgrading from a Rift S.?
2023-03-15,Where can you get a quest pro at retail prices in Europe outside of Germany and Spain?
2023-03-15,Does it at least have a browser for WebXR games?  If so let us know your experiences with stuff like at [https://vrsites.com/](https://vrsites.com/)
2023-03-16,"A shame that the FOV is that small.

XR elite Diagonal 110, its the same as PSVR2, MetaPro is like 111 and its a shame for the immersion when you have pancake lenses with that wide sweet spot.. the only stand-alone headset that got a wide FOV is Pico4 - as far as I can tell with 123 degrees diagonal and it all comes down to that critical high vertical FOV at 105 that even matches the horizontal 105, so an equal 1 to 1 overlap..

Also dont think its a good move with fabric on the nose on XR Elite... why not use that very thin detacheable silicone gasket as they use on Pico4.. the only purpose is to light-block around your nose and not make it uncomfortable.

The resolution also leaves some to be desired... It does matter a lot for S-A VR/PCVR.. to get those tiny pixels.

and why Im looking forward for MicroOLEDs with 2560x2560 with pancake lenses.

XR Elite got 7.37 mio pixels. (2x 1920x1920)

Pico4 9.33 mio pixels. (1200PPI) (2x 2160x2160)

MetaPro 6.9 mio. (2x 1800x1920) and 1/3 less pixels vs fx the 9.33 mio.. is a lot.

The passthrough does look better on XR Elite than MetaPro... it looks closer to Pico4 [https://youtu.be/qnbc3awVEow?t=93](https://youtu.be/qnbc3awVEow?t=93) as far as I can tell from people's videos online.

but havent tried them to compare, but MetaPro does look blocky and lower res.. MetaPro openbrush [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxirnwnMlQw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxirnwnMlQw)

Is the IPD on XR elite locked with motors?..Im really not a fan of manual plastic dials.. as they will so easily move, and I will keep second guess if my IPD is still in the perfect spot.

\- and why the flying duck' dont MetaPro give you the IPD-value?  you could still let the user do the eyetracking while turning these plastic wheels to align with the feedback, but give the exact IPD-value as most people know their IPD, and it would be nice to at least doublecheck that the system is correct.

Pico4 approacch with individuel motors for each eye, and then you can dial them in software to your hearts desire  to match your known IPD.value and with 0.5mm graniluarity with 28 positions, and they simply wont move as the motors will lock them as it is all done in software..

2023-03-16,Argh I want a bigger fov not smaller! I could deal with everything but that. What did you mean by empty store though? Can't you just play any steam VR games on it?
2023-03-16,"There’s a number of titles available on the store, until the headset internal store tab is updated use the Viveport VR app to find and buy titles

2023-04-12,"I've heard some people say the FOV is worse than the quest 2, but for me and a couple others, it's better. I feel like this is just down to how sensitive this headset is to different people's head shape, so you're really rolling the dice on if the the fov will be good.

For me the XR Elite is still a better pick, but that's only because of what I'm doing with it and I got lucky with face shape. I also really don't like Facebook and I stream everything so I don't care about the limited app library, but it does sort of suck because I feel like I'm paying a premium just so I don't have to have the Zucc in my life."
2023-03-15,Why didnt you keep the pro

2023-03-15,This is an fov downgrade for Sure from quest 2 with Silicon face mask 😂
2023-03-15,AFAIK there is no 3D depth yet and the depth sensor isn’t being utilized. OP can let us know if something has changed. That would be big news though and doubt HTC has this going at this point.
2023-03-16,PSVR2 has excellent passthrough depth (even though the image is black and white)
2023-03-15,Yes. Because the store is mostly PC games. This is better then Index for Sure. But 1.4k is just to much
2023-03-16,Yeah still waiting here too and thinking about hitting the cancel order button will wait for more first impressions before I pull the trigger.
2023-03-15,Sounds like you're a good candidate for that Bigscreen headset
2023-03-15,Sure. But don't tell me you are going to leave your Controllerers at home and only use Hand tracking. Not possible. Yesterday I Couldn't close an app because it didn't Support Hand tracking
2023-03-15,"The problem is the hand tracking works in basically nothing but the menu. Unless you're planning on taking it with you to just look through the menu, you need the controllers."

2023-03-15,wireless.
2023-03-15,Wireless but also travel. You cannot even watch movies while travelling. Even with laptop you need a base station. Thing doesnt even have its own head tracking.
2023-03-15,"The Bigscreen costs \~$300 more (since you have to buy the knuckles and base stations)

But the XR elite doesn't really have much of a market, for PCVR people are likely to just get the Pro for $100 cheaper, especially since the Pro sounds better in every area except Meta, which the general population doesn't really care about much, and AR, but the XR doesn't have the depth sensor working yet anyway"
2023-03-15,"Not a peep here, either.  All these stories of people who got theirs weeks ago got my hopes up for a faster arrival date.  No such luck!"
2023-03-16,"No, it's only inside tracking."
2023-03-16,Sure. I mean the standalone store
2023-03-16,I was there. Games is around 10. The rest is movies and stuff
2023-03-28,Get Quest Pro. I did. Super Happy with it now
2023-03-16,"Main thing I didn't like was how much pixel inversion it has (lines that show with head movement, in this case they are diagonal). Tried two, both the same.

Also comfort. Comfy at first but then would cause a lot of discomfort in my forehead.

Lastly, the cost of £1500 I decided wasn't worth it at that point, not enough of an upgrade over my Quest 2 with Elite battery strap and VR cover face mask (I have an 8kx for cockpit games too anyway).

Still though, the controllers were awesome, and you can't deny that clarity!"
2023-03-15,"Yeah, that's my general understanding as well. I am really interested in trying high resolution pass through but, only if it's depth correct. It's crazy how much I've already gotten used to walking around without taking off my QPro."
2023-03-25,"Man the passthrough in psvr 2 is INSANE! I use my quest 2 & psvr 2. With my psvr 2 I can easily read phone messages and even browsed the web on my phone to look stuff up, without taking my headset off. I'd expect the quest pro to be even better since it's advertised as a ""premium"" business tool. I'm quite eager to try one sometime. Everyone I've seen who has one says it's great. However, they do note that passthrough isn't great for reading, but it can be done with some squinting."
2023-03-16,I've used it. It's about as depth accurate as the Quest 2. It's just higher resolution.
2023-03-15,Awesome. Thanks for sharing all your feedback and answering peoples questions
2023-03-15,I considered briefly. But then need to buy the controllers separately (plus sensors)

Carry it in glasses mode (back removed) so you can work with 3 virtual monitors when you're traveling, co-working, cafe, etc. As long as Immersed / VD support hands-only, then the hybrid design of XR Elite means not owning both a VR headset (for gaming) & AR glasses (for work).

2023-03-15,"Well then I take it that it wasn't present on the XR. Good news. The amber glow on the Qpro is like an IPS glow that happens on the corners of IPS monitors. It was only really noticeable on my left lense of my Qpro.

2023-03-15,"The problem is not as bad as /u/magnumload is making it seem. In 99.9% of the games, it's not noticeable. There's just a few standalone games where it stands out. Netflix and big Screen are great examples of how bad it can look but, that will be fixed update v52 when local dimming gets enabled in all content. It also looks pretty bad when you take it off and look at the lens from distance when the headset is starting, which is where most people take pictures of it and it makes it look 100x worse than it actually is. 

[Example of a headset from a distance](https://i.imgur.com/9ojPE7b.jpg). Looks pretty bad. But if you look closely, you can see the Meta boot logo in their lens. It does not look anything like this in game.

[Example of Karnage Chornicles, one of the worst PCVR games to show it](https://i.imgur.com/nKva8C6.mp4). The worst part about this clip is the lens reflecting the lights in their room. But they do a great job showing the edges and the brown glow is barely noticeable."
2023-03-15,"Don't go looking for the problem. You can't unsee it. On my unit it was extremely noticable on the left lense in even remotely darkish areas. Hell it just had to be a slight overcast on content and could be seen.

2023-03-16,"what makes tou think the MetaPro got depth correct cameras.

as a shareholder in Meta, Im pretty sure we still uses two B&W tracking cameras when it comes to the two sidemounted cams.

the only difference is that they are optimized for straight ahead and we get cleaner and more optimised data vs fx if it was in the periphel view, like on others..

you can see the early footprints..all our depth handling were intended to be handle by our ToF sensor. (Time of flight) and something we ditched in the last moment..

I dont have the partnumbers for the two forward mounted cameras, but I recall VR Oasis claiming it was simply 2 B&W IR cameras, and if that the case, then its the exact same as B/W IR tracking cameras.. and why you can get a B&W feed out on fx PCVR2 and Quest2.

To my understanding its the exact same thing Pico4 also does.

taking depth information from the B&W IR tracking cameras and overlay that depth information on top of the RGB passthrough..

it what gives that wavy effect in MetaPro and Pico4..

2023-03-15,"Agreed. But, I don't think it's something easy to do. If it were, it would already be on Meta devices. They're pushing hand tracking really hardcore but, only games that support it use it. There's no controller emulation that I know of."

Because I own one and use it daily. It's the most 3D and accurate headset on the market. 

>as a shareholder in Meta,

Lol, wut? Being a share holder doesn't mean anything outside of ""you own shares"". You don't get insider information or anything like that. Why would you even mention such a pointless thing?

>Im pretty sure we still uses two B&W tracking cameras when it comes to the two sidemounted cams.

Yes, that has been well known since it was announced. 2 black and white cameras for the main feed and 3D depth calculating and 1 RGB camera for color.

>you can see the early footprints..all our depth handling were intended to be handle by our ToF sensor. (Time of flight) and something we ditched in the last moment..

No you can't. You're just regurgitating the same BS that Sadlyitsbradly claimed. A depth sensor is needed to calculate object placement more accurately, it's not needed for understanding 3D depth.

>but I recall VR Oasis claiming

Wait, I thought you were a shareholder with more information? You mean, you're just someone who can't afford a Quest Pro and is regurgitating things you heard others say with no real thoughts of your own? I never would have guessed...."
2023-03-23,"> Seriously the quest pro is the stupidest device ever. I have it and use it everyday but it boggles my mind how grainy the passthrough is for supposedly a pro device?

The pass through is quite grainy but, it's the best in the industry for now. There's higher resolution pass through devices but, they lack full 3D depth. And no other device comes close to it's VR capabilities. The XR Elite is a complete turd of a failure, the Pico 4 has some of the dullest screens at less than 60nits and the color saturation is terrible. The Aero has high pixel density but very poor lens and poor FOV, no audio, no mic, and no 3D pass through. 

>You can't even read anything on it.

Having proper lighting in your play space does help. 

>If only it were a whole lot clearer then the pro would substantially be better but. meta is too busy tracking us to care.

No, they just opted to choose to focus on better aspects of the passthrough, such as 3D depth accuracy, over raw resolution. Whereas others, like the XR Elite, focused on resolution over 3D depth accuracy. 

Pass through has very little use right now. There's almost nothing that uses it and no reason for it to be any better. In 4-5 years, when there's a lot of AR content, that 

>Face and eye tracking? nobody uses it and is completely unnecessary. at this point in time

Huh? You sure you have a Quest Pro and you're not just looking for an argument? There's far more content using the face and eye tracking now than there is using the passthrough. Even foveated rendering even works with PCVR content now using the OpenXR Toolkit. Eye tracking is getting used a LOT.

Pico4 OpenBrush [https://youtu.be/S4IxocWUWbg?t=257](https://youtu.be/S4IxocWUWbg?t=257)

Its the exact same approach as Pico4

passthrough with a single RGB camera, where you using B/W IR tracking cameras depth-values overlaid on top of the RGB passthrough, the only advantage metapro got,is they have dedicated two forward tracking/IR cameras for mapping' for a less contaminated depth information, but when you having such a inferior passthrough-camera quality, you are getting a worse AR/MR experience overall. (sadly)

and you as a loyal Meta-consumer, Im glad that you took the plunge on our product, but if you did your due diligence you would sense, it was intended to have a ToF, its not a lie or bullshit as you seem to think and all our big claims were centered around having that sensor..

Open up your MetaPro and you will see the big area where the ToF sensor should have been.

or you can just look at Ifixit teardown [https://youtu.be/LDUJLnrCgow?t=230](https://youtu.be/LDUJLnrCgow?t=230)

You need either Lidar or Time of flight sensors that constantly are poking your surrounding, to get a potent AR/MR experience with extremely accurate depth information, like you dont seem to know.

the problem  with these Black & white IR tracking cameras, is they are so sensitive to so many things in a daily household.

your LED lightning where many are pulse width modulated (PWM), same with your monitors or your laptop screens, also a flashing IR mess as  so many of them operate with on/off frequency modulation.

These B/W IR tracking cameras are also very sensitive to dark enviroment, or if there is toomuch light, fx sunlight that is plastred in IR.

So no, - B/W IR tracking cameras are not the best for 3D mapping, they come with many cons and why VR- is moving towards ToF or Lidar sensors for 3D mapping.

Nope, there's a bunch now. Even Immersed uses it. Surprised you didn't know this since you claim to use it. It prompts to use eye and face tracking every time you open it.

>virtually nothing using face tracking except for VR chat maybe?

Anything that uses OpenXR on PC can technically use face and eye tracking. Immersed uses it, VRChat, Pokerstars, everything that uses Meta avatars, Wooorld, and several others. 

>Maybe the bar is so low in the VR space that this device is considered pro? despite obviously having massive glaring issues like it's passthrough?

No, it's just that you're focusing on it's one and only shortcoming because you're obviously trying to hate it. Every other features is better than every other consumer VR headset but, you aren't mentioning that.

>it's the best in the industry right now? That's how low the bar is?

If you stop focusing on only the passthrough and use it for VR, it's pretty easy to see how it's the best the in the industry. 

>Maybe it's their marketing but I expected this device to have high rez and a passthrough where you could read. After it all it is PrO. Nope.

Guess you've been living under a rock? The quality of the pass through has been known since day one and everyone has repeated to not buy it strictly for passthrough. Buy it for VR and use the passthrough for things like running and grabbing a drink without taking it off."
2023-03-27,"Played VRChat, contractors, Pavlov, and walkabout mini golf all wireless VR with an AMD RX 6800xt.  Maxed out out the bitrate to 200 mb/s and enabled the experimental tcp mode.  So far have played everything without issue and it all looks good.  To me the FOV is probably around the same as the G2 and doesn't get in the way of me having fun.  As for standalone have tried the air guitar and hyper dash, both played very well.  Though when you enable the passthrough the fan can get quite loud so I only use passthrough when grabbing controllers or leaving boundary.  So far I'm enjoying it a lot, it was certainly worth the upgrade over the G2 in my opinion."

I'm not even talking of 4k passthrough either. It just needs to be clear enough to read text that's it. It can't even do that.

Immersed does use facial expressions and eye tracking you are correct too bad I couldn't care any less and turned all of those settings off.

Like I said I use this device everyday I use it for work.
It's just a massive letdown in the productivity department.

As PCVR headset it's definitely great with it's clear optics.
however I don't do PCVR. I tried it and it sucks. The disconnect from what you see vs what you're doing is disorienting.

Simply put this is a productivity only device for me with the occasional fitness app.
This device's release timing is also weird.

It seems like if this were released a year or 2 earlier this device would be much better liked.

2023-04-03,"I used the XR Elite at work for development. I dislike many things about it and would not buy it, however, the form factor and also the lenses are great. I can imagine people love the headset for watching movies while travelling, or probably for P."
2023-04-04,"I am coming from an original Vive with deluxe audio and wireless adapter. I have had the XR elite for a few days and it is a keeper.

It has its issues but for me they are mostly software related. The app store needs a lot of work. Certain features could be more intuitive. It needs a native virtual desktop (it is on the way) and could really use much better 2d android app support. But these aren't the features that were determining factors for me. My primary reasons for getting it were it's size and portability, diopters, and native built in wireless PC VR streaming.

I understand many people have found it uncomfortable. I think this is just highly subjective. When positioned correctly for me it is perfectly comfortable in both eyeglass and HMD mode. The arm rests tilt up in the back for me a little and it cups the back of my head. In this position it just feels right. If I tilt the arms down towards my ears, like eye glasses, it becomes uncomfortable and the face gasket unsnaps. It isn't going to fit everyone perfectly of course but for me once I get it into the right position I could wear it all day.

On a good wireless network it is nearly flawless in wireless mode. I have several Ubiquiti WIFI6 APs and I can connect to my PC from all over the house. It is just as good as my Vive Wireless adapter with the benefit of being useable just about anywhere on my network. I know the tracking isn't as good as using the lighthouses, but it is surprisingly good for inside out tracking and I don't have to futz with setting the lighthouses up. The fact that I can just grab the XR and put it on and jump into VR anywhere is a game changer.

It is too small to use with eyeglasses, but my prescription is within the range that is correctable with the diopters. I don't have to wear glasses or contacts and it just looks perfectly sharp.

I setup a Hotspot on my Surface Laptop Studio and have a direct connection to the XR over WiFi 6. This works beautifully. I can just stick the XR in my backpack with my laptop and I have a whole PC VR setup on the go. The quick setup of the boundary make quick work of jumping into PC VR pretty much anywhere for me. I am surprised at how well this works. 

I can power the XR and charge the controllers from a portable battery pack I put in my back pocket. I can get several hours of use this way. My battery pack will completely recharge the XR and controllers from empty WHILE I am using it. When the pack runs down I just unplug it and charge it while I use the XR as I normally would. Once the battery pack is charged up I can plug it back into the XR when it's own battery starts to run down again. My kids and I were pretty much using XR wirelessly all day without issue this way.

I have had some strange issues connecting to the PC with the streaming app once or twice but restarting the PC solved this. When using USB streaming via my Surface Laptop Studio it starts to dip into the red for signal strength and Steam VR became very choppy. This oddly didn't happen when wirelessly connecting directly to the laptop's hotspot.  It could be related to quality of the USB cable but I suspect it is a software bug that needs to be worked out.

There are some strange choices and glitches in how their software works but once I figured them out I didn't have all the problems other people were complaining about. I turned off the dynamic image quality feature and just cranked the streaming rate to 200 Mbps and it looks beautiful wirelessly streaming. The original default settings are very blurry.

You have to turn off the controller compatibility setting for the controllers to be identified properly. Once I did this the controllers were identified and work correctly in most of my Steam VR games.

So far I am quite happy with the purchase."
2023-04-03,"I plan on getting one once the face tracking add-on comes out, and regardless of what I think of it I wouldn't be returning it and will still get use out of it. I was very disappointed with my Vive pro 2 but still used it for 6 months before getting a aero.

It's well known on the internet that complainers/naysayers are the types of people who feel most motivated to say something and so that cohort of any specific group will be the ones you disproportionately hear from.

I'm a fan of the XR Elite's ""cousin"" the Focus 3, so I am very interested to know if HTC made a winner or if they fumbled the ball, especially cause a lot of people who returned the XR Elite and told us about it, they complain about the lack of standalone library, as an almost PCVR only, that's not really a relevant concern for me."

2023-04-03,Why not get a vive pro eye with the facial tracker and wireless adapter? The Vive pro 1 with the gear lens mod is still my favourite PCVR headset.

2023-04-03,"That's literally not true. Majority of people who were returning it had multiple things to complain about and if mentioned then standalone library was the least of the problems. Mostly terrible FOV, glare, not entire lens being clear, facial interface with weak magnets, bad quality of pcvr image, bad binocular overlap, strap digging in hard into head in glasses mode."
2023-04-03,"Not likely. The quest pro was labeled dead on arrival. And it is in fact not selling well hence price cuts. 

Same thing with this thing."
2023-04-03,"The bigscreen beyond is using a custom fit for each person, that's why they have you scan your face with an iPhone beforehand."
2023-04-03,"I would not use it for PCVR, Reverb G2 does much better job for way cheaper and I would not use it for standalone gaming, since it has way worse headset tracking and smaller library than both Quest Pro and Quest 2

2023-08-24,"Yeah, exactly ""P"" for Playing...games"
2023-04-04,"I have a Zotac 1080 Mini in my desktop PC. It has a Ryzen 3900X CPU, 4TB of RAID 0 of NVME storage, and 64GB of RAM. It is hard wired to network. I typically use the computer for hosting VMs and general work. But it is still great for playing games. I am probably going to replace the GPU with a 7900XT soon. Wireless gaming on this is perfectly smooth.
 
Surface Laptop Studio - Intel Core i7, 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050. Wireless gaming with this over a direct connection was also smooth. It also works over USB streaming, but after a while of use it kept stuttering. There were some GPU and CPU spikes but nothing was hitting 100%. I am not sure what caused the slow downs yet."
2023-04-03,"Wireless adapter does not work well in hotter environments, I have no cooling/ac in my playspace.

And the lighter weight of the xr is a big one for me. I want wireless for when I am moving round fast and I would rather not hurt my neck lol."
2023-04-03,Yeah but making it work on pc (face tracking that is) is a actual pain in the ass. Vive at least had a good track record of making shit work on pc right out of the box
2023-04-03,"They said ""I would like to know if"" and you treated it like an assertion"
2023-04-03,"I labelled the quest pro as DOA based on reviews.

Bought one last weekend after the price cuts and I love it coming from the quest 2 for PCVR"
2023-04-03,"> And it is in fact not selling well hence price cuts. 

They've been selling like hotcakes since the price cut, though. Every VR subreddit and Discord I am in has tons of new owners ranting and raving about them. Even some of the main modders for the Flat2VR discord have switched and say it's the best headset they've ever used."
2023-04-03,"You’d be forgiven for thinking otherwise, given how many posts and comments there are in this sub recommending the Quest Pro. Even in this thread where I specifically asked not to make alternative HMD recommendations. 

Also not sure if you’re “same with this thing” remark is to do with the XR Elite being DOA, or that you think there’ll be a price drop. I think you mean the former but just thought I’d note that historically HTC have not tended to reduce prices, seeming in favour to prefer to leave them on shelves."
2023-04-03,lol
2023-04-04,Cool thanks. I need a new GPU too but they’re just not good value at the moment. AFAIK the 7900XT (and XTX) doesn’t work well with VR. I’m waiting for LTT to report on it actually as he committed to using it for a month and is a VR enthusiast.
2023-04-03,Took me less than 1min to get it working on PC. Takes longer to read the instructions on how to do it than it takes to actually do it.
2023-04-03,"afaik you only need a developer account for face-tracking on the Quest Pro, then you just click a slider in the Oculus desktop app."
2023-04-03,"As a Quest 2 to Quest Pro user, how do you feel about the comfort? Are you using any 3rd party accessories?"
2023-04-03,Glad to hear. I'll support vr to the death.

2023-04-03,If it's anything like the focus 3 it should work
2023-04-03,It will work. It will just tank the battery from 1.5 to 2hrs down to around 1 to 1.5 hours.
2023-04-03,"I did a recent switch from Q2 to QPro. My Q2 was kitted out with the BoboVR M2 Plus with battery and their facial interface. On the Quest Pro the only comfort accessory I use is brackets to put the rear pad 2cm lower, which allows me to tilt the headset more, making the forehead pad distribute across a bigger area than it does for my by default, as well as add FOV. 

I find that when I initially put the headsets on, Q2 is more comfortable with all the pillow-y padding, compared to the Pro's hard padding. Also the Q2 has more pressure areas which means there's not one single area that's holding all the weight. 

However, after 15-20 minutes of use, the Pro becomes way better. Especially for me personally, the weight Q2 puts on my cheekbones (even with the halo strap) becomes very uncomfortable. The PU leather starts sliding around because my face gets a bit sweaty from the halo and facial interface contact. The Pro stays consistent all the time while wearing it. Additionally, because of the sliding around, the Q2 creates very slight additional eye strain because the sweet spot gets moved around for me. I never noticed this before getting the Pro where the sweet spot is basically the whole lens. 

The Pro is also lighter compared to my Q2 setup which is definitely noticeable. But that weight is needed to make the Q2 balanced, while the Pro's balance is perfect out of the box. 

Hope this wall of text is useful to you!"
2023-04-07,"No longer an argument, support for openxr eye tracking have been just aded to quest pro."
2023-04-03,"It was except for one thing not being clear, are the brackets for the quest pro you mention included with the pro or made by meta? Or is it a 3rd party accessory?"

2023-04-03,"That's a seriously good price, regardless of whether it's EUR or USD. I bought mine at the equivalent of €1000 (second hand, pre pricedrop) and I think it was worth that."
2023-03-30,"Thanks for the write up, I just got mine today and have been playing with it. I have owned Oculus Rift, Rift S, Quest, Vive, Vive Pro, Vive Pro 2 and Valve Index. I have to say the Elite XR is the most uncomfortable headset (physically) I have worn, and my face shape is not particularly unusual. There is a general ""haze"" look to the image, and I much prefer the fresnel lens artifacts to this feel.

Also I am one who has felt that OLED provides the most subversive experience over resolution. The colors on the XR Elite are somewhat washed out and there is no real black (which to be fair wa the reason I returned the Index and why I still prefer the Vive and Vive Pro 1 over the Vive Pro 2).

I agree the quality of the PCVR WiFi streaming after changing settings is great (be sure to turn off dynamic nitrate, that really was messing things up for me). But the deal killer is still why I prefer base stations: the controller tracking. It simply isn't good enough. This is a general problem of all inside/out tracking hardware, and honestly the Elite XR is just about as good as any if not slightly better. But it just isn't good ENOUGH. And you can never drop your hands in a game because you will lose tracking, so you end up having to constantly hold your hands up.

And one final note: the buttons on the controllers are horrible. They have a soft, loose and clicky feel to them that makes them feel cheap and play is unpleasant. When I switched back to the standard Vive controllers it was like going from a cheap old car to a luxury sport car.

Not sure yet what I will do, but I had really hoped to finally have a more portable solution without base stations. This is not is."
2023-03-29,"Thanks for taking the time to write this all up. I’m exactly the type of person you describe (currently considering whether to get a XR Elite, Quest Pro, Pico 4 or Pimax Crystal, or maybe even wait for Big Screen Beyond).

I had pretty much written off the XR Elite due to the price to value ratio, and over the past couple of days Reddit has been flooded with negative reviews. I must admit though yours is giving me pause. It’s a lot to think about. 

Thanks again."
2023-03-30,"Excellent review. I'm still considering whether to return mine.

One of the reasons I got mine was to make it so I did VR more, out of convenience. But the thing is, it's actually easier to get going quickly with my wireless VP2 setup than the XRE. I've had to do room setup again each time, waiting for the device to start, taking longer, along with inconveniences like no passthrough in steamvr.

And the other half, being able to do *something* portably, isn't really there. I have a Pixel, so no phone share, and my favorite VR fitness app Audio Trip doesn't have a port. Maybe I can transfer movies to it or something but I typically need to do multiple things at once. A mere movie isn't stimulating enough.

I've had stuck pixels that have disappeared. Plus size is that I haven't really noticed any screendoor. Yet.

Besides that, pretty much what you said. Though as a developer, well, I haven't really done any VR dev. And if I wanted to, I have a Lynx R1 on the way. I'm not sure how the experience will compare, but the MR should be better. It's just that the XRE is very nicely portable.

Any more detailed thoughts on why specifically you think you'll be keeping it? Info on the dev stuff? I need to spend a lot more time messing with it, but I'm really pretty meh on it. It's really frustrating cause the hardware is like 95% there and 100% cool. It's just especially the software which is the issue. So who knows if it'll improve enough soon enough or not. Ugh.

Edit: nevermind. I really see the screendoor. And glare. And there's aliasing in the video and browser apps."
2023-03-30,What settings are you using in vive streaming hub?
2023-03-31,"I have total mixed thoughts about the XR elite.  I owed many headsets from Oculus to G2, Vive Pro,  Reverb G2, Vive Pro 2 and Pimax 8kx,   and a few many years back.  I've also tried the quest pro. 

After my first 2 to 3 hours using the XR elite I was pretty much dead set on returning it.  But, then I gave it a few more tries, and I'm leaning more towards keeping it and selling my Vive Pro 2.  

In terms of comfort;  it does have a forehead issue with some hard plastic mashing into the forehead. 

Sound is OK at best, it's still totally usable but not over the esr quality.  This can be fixed by using a headset.  

The diopter is a huge bonus, but I don't think they are accurate.   My vision is a -2.00, and I have to set it to 4 on the dial.    I originally figured I would only need to set it to the 2.  

The fov reminds me of the G2.  It was super difficult at first using the Vive Pro 2 and the Pimax 8kx as its tunnel vision.  I've readjusted. 

The controllers are meh!   I sort of got it working with space calibration with my knuckles and basestations, but for some reason, the program isn't seeing my 3 base stations at the same level.   

Also, I can't seem to figure out why most steamVR games don't even work with the default controllers.  SteamVR sees the controllers as cosmos.   There was a compatibility box in the VIVe controller options, but that didn't do much.  

The XR visual clarity is super nice.  I went back to my wireless vive pro 2, and I thought I had issues with my lenses as there was much blur in comparison.  It's night and day difference.  

I also have the pimax crystal on pre-order,  but that's many months away.  So, I'm not sure. 

If I could fix the knuckles and get them working with XR, I would probably just sell my  VP2. 

The comfort thing should be an easy fix."
2023-03-29,">>Can you summarize the preceding post for me?

>The post is a review of the XR Elite headset from HTC. The writer reports that the headset's hardware was released before the software was finished, which gives it an early Beta/Late Alpha feel to it. They also mention that hand tracking inputs aren't tuned well, and the UI doesn't handle unintended inputs well. They also report that many apps aren't configured to work with the controllers, making the headset less useful. The writer goes on to discuss the PCVR experience and notes that the SteamVR integration is excellent. However, the streaming quality can appear terrible due to the default settings, and there are several settings in the Vive Streaming Hub that aren't easily accessible to the user. Lastly, the writer talks about comfort and hardware, noting that the pancake lens implementation makes the headset uncomfortable for most people. The top of the facial interface has a hard plastic forehead rest that kills comfort, and there's no angled cutout on the lens to factor in the user's nose. The writer suggests canting the lenses at an angle or dropping the diopter to improve the headset's comfort.

>> Can you summarize if/how the author says it can be made better?

>The author offers several suggestions to improve the XR Elite headset's performance and user experience. To improve the hand tracking inputs, the author suggests tuning the sensitivity of pinching and fixing the way the UI handles unintended inputs. Additionally, the author recommends providing clear information on how to adjust the streaming quality and making the default quality settings context and environment-dependent. The author also suggests disabling the compatibility mode in the Vive Streaming Hub, which causes SteamVR to see the XR controllers as Cosmos controllers, and allowing the XR controllers to be recognized in games. To improve the headset's comfort, the author recommends changing the hard plastic forehead rest to hard rubber and redesigning the lenses by canting them at an angle or dropping the diopter."
2023-03-29,"Thanks for the write up, just cancelled my preorder. I haven’t had a vr headset since the DK2, and the Vive XR Elite was going to be my jump back in the pool after the technology had matured. A light comfortable headset was at the top of my want list and I was willing to concede some visual quality to get it, but it sounds like the XR may not live up to that promise. 

Ironically I just ordered a Steamdeck as well, which arrives tomorrow. I have higher hopes for that product"
2023-03-29,"At the beginning I was worried that cancelling XR Elite after hearing day one experience of one of the users here on reddit was a bad idea. But it seems that every next review confirms what the first mentioned. There is a lot of things that need to be improved to justify the price and marketing of this headset. I am happy that I went with Quest Pro. Even for the controllers alone it was a great choice. 

Thanks for sharing all that feedback. The more experiences users will write about the faster HTC can potentially adjust/change things  when they realize not many people buy and lots return their headsets."
2023-03-29,"Thanks for taking the time to share this with the internet. You've certainly saved me from ordering it, at least for now. I wanted it because it's a standalone headset with good specs and I'm willing to spend the extra money to avoid Meta and protect my privacy. I guess I'll wait to see if the library for standalone gets better. I have a PCVR  capable laptop (Ryzen 9 5900HX and RTX 3070) but I live in a dorm building and can't get good enough internet for wirless PCVR and have no way to manage a wired cable comfortably so I really need standalone. Maybe I'll revisit the XR Elite when the library has more standalone games."
2023-03-30,I'm new to this type of VR. How do you adjust the compression settings?
2023-03-30,Nice write up. Sounds like they dropped the ball big time. I hope they clear it up for the people that have purchased. What a shit show.
2023-03-30,"this is a good read. and not sure what i want to do.

im a huge pc FPS gamer and own a quest 2 right now and use to own a HTC vive. i hated the vive lens old model i owned and did the mod lens that did help a bit. the quest 2 is a bit better then the old vive i owned but still bad. i dont care for stand alone  i mostly play pc vr games and go to bigscreen for movies. this headset was/could still be  on ym list to buy for an upgrade. im looking for a great PCVR headset that i can also stream to twitch and have no problems setting it up. quest isnt helping me with the twitch setup. things get very complected very fast. i do like how the quest pro lens are and it has a neat eye and face tracking but for what i will do with a VR headset is not a must need but a nice thing to have. valve index is outdated but as of right now it seems like the best bet for pcvr with OVR toolkit i can use to stream games but i hate the lens  on those. and then the vive xr was the next headset that i am researching and looks promising but sounds like a bunch of software problems that can be fixed threw updates. how long for the fixs? time can tell. another big thing was the controllers and there tracking. i dont want to play the new ghost of tabor and loose tracking or put my hand behind my back to get a backpack and the controllers want to start bugging out.  im wondering if you can use the base stations with the index controllers and pair it with the vive xr headset for steam vr. so as of right now im good keep an eye out for the vive xr and hopefully everything comes out well with it, sooner the better and that way i can get it right away.  i really want to make gamig content with a GREAT headset that i can stand by. quest pro is great but i hate there air link/link and really cant do fully steam vr with out problems. 90% of my games are steamvr and not really looking to buy games threw stand alone headset and get locked in with that brand.  i may get some games here and there but most will be threw steam.

&#x200B;

.also i like using cable for gaming but at times do treat my self with wireless so if there is a headset that does well with both thats a A+ for me"
2023-03-30,"Got a dead pixel on mine too. Another weird thing is im getting these really weird glitches where the screen starts tearing up with white streaks. At first I thought it was a streaming thing, but I still had it when I went back to the vive lobby on the standalone OS. It only happened after I was using it for more than an hour as I was watching a movie. I hope it's just a defective unit, and they don't all do that."
2023-04-02,"Have you tried accessing the SteamVR hub itself instead of the games?

&#x200B;

I have an issue where the SteamVR hub itself won't load unless you run steam as an admin (accessed in right click properties) but that means I have to hit the dammed run button every time I want to make a change or run something else. I gotta say, goggles off, hitting that button and goggles on gets mighty old real fast.

Not running as an admin just leaves me in the streaming limbo waiting for SteamVR to load. It's basically the background image but no loading of the hub environment. 

&#x200B;

It's all well and good being able to run a game direct from the xr's interface, but I run DCS world as a stand alone (non steam version) and I generally have to load up the hub first beforehand to get things working. I really don't want to have to do the above song and dance three or four times just to start it up."
2023-04-03,">""Despite the current state, I'm not returning mine. It does what I need it to do as a developer, I have other headsets to do what it can't, and I'm willing to wait for the software side to get better with time. Since Pico might never come to the USA, this is pretty much the only semi-competent Meta alternative in the states until Deckard shows up in a decade or two. Hope this was useful to someone.""

Thank you for the excellent write up.  I have owned the XR Elite for a week now and agree with your assessment.  I too have a dead pixel and will be replacing it with a different unit but will definitely be keeping the unit.  I like the modularity and the glasses mode.  Still needs a lot of software refinement and comfort mods but I believe they are achievable."
2023-04-13,"I’m curious, because I’ve had a terrible time getting this piece of shit to stream anything well.  I have a 3090 and a 5900x (and everything else is comparable quality) and I feel like I’m streaming from a cell phone.  What settings have you enabled to make PCVR playable?"
2023-03-30,Shout out for Vive pro 1. I am loving mine with the gear VR conversion.
2023-03-30,"Yeah, I agree with all of this. Every time I go back to my OG Vive I'm reminded of just how much more immersive OLED is than even the best LCD. Hoping QLED like in new Pimax offerings and Quest pro evolve the tech to be comparable to what we used to have. The best regular LCD blacks and color that I've used is the VP2, and even that falls short of first gen headsets. In fact, 5k OLED is the main reason why the Bigscreen Beyond is exciting to me. I'd place the Vive XR Elite screen above the Quest 2, and below the VP2. I haven't had the chance to use a Quest Pro, but I'd love to find out how good local dimming is at addressing LCD limitations.

I wasn't particularly offended by the tracking or controllers as they're both on the better side of Inside-Out options and I'm just used to the limitations now. Controllers are lower quality than Oculus Touch, but better than the best of Windows Mixed reality and that's about the best I hoped for anyway."
2023-03-30,Don't pause... go with your gut. This one sucks.
2023-03-30,"Interesting, your experience with the Wireless adapter for the Vive is pretty much the opposite of mine, though I've only been able to use it with the OG Vive since I don't have the newer battery for the Pro 2. I can't use passthrough at all, it actually crashes SteamVR if I try, where as the XR Elite has no issues using passthrough in SteamVR. With my setup, I have to wait a lengthy 30 second to 1 minute for my lighthouses to spin up each time I start SteamVR, where as the XR Elite is effectively always on standby and ready to just slide over my face. I also don't seem to need to reset my boundary unless I move to a different room; it seems to remember my room pretty well (I think they should add memory for multiple rooms though, as it seems to only be able to hold onto one space at a time).

My main dev reason for holding onto it is that it sends hand tracking to SteamVR, where as competitors don't, and I thought ""If it's sending that, maybe it will send Eye and Face tracking to SteamVR too when that gets released"", I also saw the shockingly void launch library as an opportunity too. A small indie game on a platform with no games is better than nothing at all, so why not try while I have the chance? I don't want this headset to fail, as I still think it's close enough that software maturity and a price cut could save it.

If this was the headset they released instead of the Vive Flow (reminder that the Vive Focus 3 was already out when the Flow was released), I think the shortcomings and empty library would have been easier to overlook. Right now they're playing catch up against a device line that's had two and a half generations, four years of games, and over 50 software revisions. I'm holding onto mine because I'm stubbornly holding out hope that they can do it, even against my better judgement. I also really want to play Yuki in AR.

My biggest fear is that HTC freaks out from the backlash like they did with the Cosmos and go back to avoiding Meta rather than competing directly. Meta doesn't want HTC to compete, they want them to die off. If HTC prematurely gives up on the consumer market a second time, it might actually happen."
2023-03-31,"I'm starting to feel a lot like you are right now. The more I use it, the less I'm bothered by it. I'm not in a position to get rid of my VP2 in favor of it, but that's because I don't have any other similarly premium options to lean back on. The FOV thing is just as you said, it's the same as the Reverb G2 and that's kinda fine. It only feels bothersome when you're used to unusually wide FOV headsets like Pimax and VP2, and you get used to it over time. I am concerned about how much FOV remains when the Eye tracking module is added though. Pictures make it seem quite a bit thick.

The clarity thing is something I noticed too. I had to second guess if my VP2 lenses were foggy when I put it back on because the XR Elite clarity really is that sharp by comparison.

I'm also already working on solving the comfort issues, because like you said too, it's an easy fix.

As far as the Cosmos controller problem in SteamVR I did mention how to resolve that. I'm considering making a separate post highlighting how to fix that specifically. Essentially, counter-intuitively you want that compatibility mode in the Vive Streaming hub off, as that's the exact thing that's changing them into Cosmos controllers. It also overrides any overriding done by Steam's built-in compatibility mode. Once that's taken care of, I'd argue the controller compatibility is actually better than something like the Reverb G2.

Be sure to tell us how well the Crystal experience goes when you get it, as I'm sure a lot of us are eager to know."
2023-03-30,You are going to love the steam deck. They knocked it out of the ballpark with that one.
2023-03-30,"Unfortunately after some more usage I really started to notice the screen streaks issue. I'm not sure how best to verbally describe it other than that it looks like when a screen is too cold to operate and starts glitching out or a failing cable connection, like clusters/groupings of pixels are crashing for a single frame. In standalone it happens only rarely, but when pushed on high settings in streaming it becomes constant, and as you said, it continues on into standalone until it calms down. If it is a universal issue then that might be a good thing, as it would be something likely to be fixed if possible.

I've never had anything like it happen before in any headset, so I doubt the screen itself is the issue, and the Focus 3 pushes a higher resolution so the processor shouldn't be having difficulties (unless it's an issue there too and we just don't know about it). Best case scenario is an OS bug that can be fixed with updates. Worst case scenario it's a hardware issue and no engineer tested it for more than 5 minutes. I'd hope for a recall if that were the case, but this is HTC so we can't bet on that.

edit: I've found that disabling High Preformance Mode in developer settings drastically reduces this issue. So essentially the processor is being overclocked when that's on and as a side effect it can't keep up when under stress. There's still a small amount of it when it's off, but it's manageable."
2023-04-02,I've never had issues with this. Launching just SteamVR itself from the headset works fine. You must have something weird going on with your Steam installation or Windows permissions.
2023-03-30,"It sucks _now_. Sounds like a good product, just unfinished. If I wait a month or two it could improve and have a price drop."
2023-03-30,"Thank you for sharing your experience more!

Yeah, my experience is pretty good, mostly because I got it for my VP2 in the first place (so it came with the 21W battery, plus I later ordered another bigger Anker one), and also because I ordered a fan to keep it cool. The most annoying part is how the antlers push into your head as you put it on. Plus the wait time for the base stations I guess.

Idk about your passthrough issue. What I do know is that I feel like I got the best working VP2 there is -- my firmware is marked as ""VIVE_Pro 2 PV"" instead of most people's ""VIVE_Pro 2 MV"". So I wonder if I got some early batch gold one, whereas everyone else got ones with poor quality control. Fun.

As for passthrough with the XRE, well, I don't get that button. And iirc my passthrough automatically turns on? I can't quite remember. I have no clue why it's missing.

I'll have to see if I can get my setup with the XRE to such a state where I can also hold it on standby to do that too. That's kind of what I wanted, whereas I do still have to plug in my headset and turn on the base stations every time. But so far, room setup's a pain. And I like the Index controllers better -- so if I ever get mixed VR working, I'm pretty sure that'll need setup every time, too.

>it sends hand tracking to SteamVR

Yeah this is pretty sick.

With this plus the other dev stuff you're talking about, I really think you should take a look at the Lynx R1. Especially for MR, but even as a platform for VR. The plan is to be a more open headset, and it's hand tracking controlled primarily. Controllers coming later. And it's the nice Ultraleap hand tracking. I'm pretty confident it forwards that data -- and if they don't, it's pretty much just an oversight. It would be fun to see a nice indie game on their store, too.

>I don't want this headset to fail, as I still think it's close enough that software maturity and a price cut could save it.

Yeah, probably. Most of the issues I have with it are software, and a bit of just high standards for XR in general. Though right now I'm particularly worried about a stuck pixel that I have right now -- and I don't know if it's the same one I had earlier or not. I really don't want to keep it with that sort of issue.

Even though it's pretty likely that the Bigscreen Beyond will get Nofio support, they're a completely separate class of headset in many ways. That won't have the same level of pop it on ability that this has, for you with the correct setup. But it should have a much better screen and lenses. Maybe I get that, but there's still the mobile uses for me. Which the Lynx could also replace. But nothing beats this portability.

>If this was the headset they released instead of the Vive Flow (reminder that the Vive Focus 3 was already out when the Flow was released), I think the shortcomings and empty library would have been easier to overlook.

100% agree. Except for the part where you're stubbornly holding onto it. They're a company, I don't owe them jack shit -- I'll spend my money if they make a good product.

For startups like Lynx, I can forgive a lot more. But not these guys. But I love HTC Vive far far more than Meta.

>My biggest fear is that HTC freaks out from the backlash like they did with the Cosmos and go back to avoiding Meta rather than competing directly. Meta doesn't want HTC to compete, they want them to die off. If HTC prematurely gives up on the consumer market a second time, it might actually happen.

This would be *really* bad. Their biggest issue with the VP2 was the lack of support and half assery of its design. It really could've been a big winner. Though a lot of people rightfully hate the lenses.

We have a lot of small companies fighting Meta, but the only decently sized ones are Bytedance, Valve, and HTC. The latter two are the only non evil ones -- and Valve only releases once a decade, maybe. We need revisions, nothing is ever one and done!

So I really hope they succeed. But that'll be merit, not me wasting $1.1k.

But what I predict the most likely scenario to be is that I return the current headset with worry of the stuck pixel, and buy one in the future, maybe. Unlike the VP2, I don't have a discount, though then again I will have my Lynx R1 sooner or later -- but this is more portable. It's hard to say. They just need to improve the software.

Also, I was looking at the 21W battery stuff for the wireless VP2 thing, and while the original battery I got seems to be no longer produced, [this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YPY31FL) was recommended and might work with 21W on the USB A QC ports. Buy at your own risk. But maybe try it."
2023-03-31,"The comfort thing I'll try and get resolved if I keep this unit.  It's an easy CAD fix,  machining, or 3D printing and should be good.  I already tested an original vive face foam, and the comfort is far superior.  

No matter what I purchase these days, I'm always having to modify or change something.  Manufacturers should really get things right from the get go.    This forehead comfort issue should have been apparent from initial testing.  

As for the controllers.  I did disable the compatibility in the vive streaming hub and the controllers are now being picked up as focus 3.  I'm still having issues though.  Is there more that needs to be done?   I also tried to change in steam the profile itself,  but not a lot of luck there either."
2023-04-02,Yeah I've had some issues with firewall as well blocking the streaming on wifi. I'll kill the antivirus for a bit and see if it that helps.
2023-04-03,"Update on the prev comment, I'm running Eset internet security, killed protection and firewall and ops were normal, turns out the antivirus is interfering with the steamvr."
2023-03-30,Double click the headset button can get you the passthrough view in the headset.
2023-03-30,"That works in the normal headset, though I leave it turned on all the time.

But what about through SteamVR? I.e. where there's the eye in the bottom right corner, and then various overlays can do stuff on top and what not"
2023-03-31,"I see, sounds like you want them to make a pass though overlay and having some usage with it. Am I reading it correctly?"
2023-03-31,"Not quite. SteamVR has built-in a feature to show you the passthrough via the cameras, and then overlays can do various stuff on top of that.

On the SteamVR dashboard there's an eye icon, and with the settings I have selected, it shows things pretty normally (on my VP2). But another setting can show things like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValveIndex/comments/c7qbzg/this_is_what_the_valve_index_passthrough_mode/)."
2024-06-21,">The thing does not charge and dies when connected to a pc,

Like every standalone headset does on a USB port that doesn't deliver enough power.

>the wireless streaming apps never work even with wifi 6E and ethernet

You should try Virtual Desktop.

>it's terrible in low light

The tracking ? Like all inside out tracked headsets.

>and the gasket for the face tracker is made of hard plastic that leaves a mark on my face. 

~~Sounds like you didn't ajusted the headset correctly.~~"
2024-06-21,I retuned this as well.  The lenses are garbage and the comfort is terrible as well. What a disappointment.
2024-06-21,Least comfortable headset I have ever had on my face by far.  That's what did it for me.
2024-06-21,"I wanted so badly for the Vive XR Elite to be good. I really wanted to break out of Meta's walled garden.

Sadly when the Vive XR Elite I ordered arrived I was shocked how poor the overall experience was. From the software to the hardware everything felt like an unpolished prototype.

I found myself constantly fiddling with the lenses trying to get focus.

They didn't even bother to develop a new controller, and shipped it with the clunky oversized monster originally made for older models.

I was (and still am) cheering for HTC to succeed in the XR space. We desperately need good alternatives to Facebook's growing monopoly in consumer VR. Alas this headset just wasn't up to it.

In the end I couldn't justify keeping it, I had to return it.

Recently at work we got a Quest 3 and it is the most consumer friendly HMD I have ever tried. 

The bar has been set, I only hope HTC's next HMD is up to the challenge."
2024-06-24,"Had it when first came out, got rid of it as was crap and got a quest 3 and never looked back. Always supported vive but not anymore"
2024-06-21,">Sounds like you didn't ajusted the headset correctly. 

That part is actually not on OP, the gasket is pretty bad and leaves red marks on your forehead and nose. They fixed this recently with the new 2.0 gasket - OP could get one for free if they enter their headset and battery serial number on Vive's website."
2024-06-25,"Where HTC fail is that they just don't maintain the software. They release half baked headsets and then the software support ends so they never get any better. Much as I hate Meta, they are really good at constantly releasing new features and pushing the capabilities all the time even with older headsets like the Quest 1. Just look at dire titles available on Viveport: Wolvic from over a year ago (never updated), same with their browser - it't no wonder that developers just ignore HTC and pile into Meta and Pico instead."
2024-06-21,"vd doesnt support the face tracker
i just put it up for auction on ebay ill prob just get a quest pro or bigscreen"
2024-06-21,that gasket doesnt fit on the face tracker
2024-06-21,"Ok so that's why they offered that free thing ?

My bad then."
2024-06-21,"Facebook made some weird decisions with the Pro. At that last minute the decided to cut costs and leave out some hardware even though the final mold had been made with spots for that hardware. Those same hardware modules did end up in the Quest 3.

It is not worthy of the 'Pro' monicker. If you go with Meta even thought it's a passthrough camera instead of a waveguide the Quest 3 is the superior device."
2024-06-21,"That's right. Perhaps the community will design a 3d-printable adapter for it eventually. The gasket that comes with the face tracker is a lot better than the stock one, but it's not quite as good as the new one. 

As for the battery draining, there is a special streaming cable that splits off to a charger input [here](https://www.amazon.com/INIU-Compatible-Accessories-Transfer-Separate/dp/B0BRQMFDQ3). It's used for quests, picos and other standalones because the ""draining while USB streaming"" issue is present on all of them."
2024-06-21,i have that exact cable and a 65 watt brick and it still dies quickly
2024-06-21,Hmm i wonder if the facetracker is making it draw more power. Have you tested without it?
2024-07-09,"I got the cable today and was able to test it - it charges the headset while streaming just fine. You need to check the outputs on your 65W power brick, only the USB-C outputs should be capable of 30W power delivery. I tested it with a regular 18W one and the battery drained while using that. Also be aware that those ""65W"" and higher chargers list that number as total output from all the ports combined, not that each port is capable of 65W."
2024-06-21,i dont see a point in using the headset without it tbh it was the only reason i bought this
2024-06-21,"Yeah, but you don't really have much choice there. As far as i know the Quest Pro is the same deal, except the mouth tracking is less accurate, but has better eyebrow tracking. The Vive Pro Eye is out of production and very expensive, and all the other headsets with eyetracking like the Varjo Aero and Pimax Crystal are way more expensive. A used Quest Pro or an XR Elite is pretty much the only option for eye and facetracking under 1000$. There's also the Pico4 Pro which also has worse mouth tracking that can get blocked if you have a big nose. The old Vive facetracker is out of production now too, and going for crazy prices on ebay"
2024-06-21,yeah i sold mine for like 3 times the price when they discontinued it lmao
2023-03-10,"Thanks for sharing! Interestingly, the Elite arguably has two advantages over the Quest Pro: built-in diopter/vision adjustment and much lighter form factor. You commented on neither of those. Any thoughts? Perhaps you have 20/20 vision, but form factor is supposed to be big deal.

Edit: Barely commented on form factor : )"
2023-03-10,"""The audio seems worse than the Quest 2 to me and there is no 3.5mm jack""  


I thought this was a weird decision and a mistake, the Focus 3 has a 3.5mm jack."
2023-03-10,"""There is glare in the Elite. You notice it instantly when it has ""VIVE"" in white on a black background. Nothing too bad, not like fresnel lens bad, but not glare free. ""  


Oh, that's... disappointing, might be a dealbreaker for me, cause I was looking forward to getting an XR Elite as my entrance into the era of really clean optics."
2023-03-10,"Weirdly, your take on this is reassuring.  I've been dying for a lightweight standalone/hybrid outside of the facebook family. So the fact that the XR Elite approaches the Q2, even if it still falls short, is basically exactly what I was hoping for."
2023-03-10,I almost pressed the trigger on the XR but decided to wait as the micro oled headsets seem to be on the way (bigscreen and others). Seems like the new display technology can really bring down the form factor or increase the ppd depending on what the headset maker prefers. Still holding to my original vive on occasional use so I'll think whatever I end up getting is going to be a big upgrade. Still would love a wireless pcvr experience.
2023-03-10,"Thanks for weighing in. I think this is a solid option for folks who will simply never purchase a Meta/Bytedance headset, but want wireless streaming to PCVR or WebXR."
2023-03-10,Did they start shipping them out or we're you an early bird?
2023-03-10,"How is it once you get really into a game?  I'm coming from WMR which did have major issues, but once you really get going and having fun I stopped noticing them."
2023-03-10,"Thanks bro, for writing this.  I was very skeptical of buying this, so this review pushes me firmly to a ""No"" on this headset.

I just don't see why I would buy the Elite if I already have the Pro.  The Pro does literally everything better.  Some may say the Elite is more comfy, but I hate pressure on my face, so Pro is more comfy for me."
2023-03-10,"Doesn't the Quest Pro have 2x 3.5mm audio jacks?
They are at front bottom of the halo strap in front of the volume button and the power rocker"
2023-03-10,">>The audio seems worse than the Quest 2 to me and there is no 3.5mm jack (same as the Quest Pro).

What? The Quest Pro does have an audio jack. Two of them actually, like the original Quest.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=L8me7V-ldJc"
2023-03-10,thank you for this review. they really should have put a headphone jack on it. will be a no buy for me.
2023-03-10,"Dimmer than a Quest 2? What is it basically black and white then? It’s amazing how these headsets can’t seem to nail color. Samsung Odyssey Plus remains the champion of color when it comes to VR, big reason I can’t move on from it, nothing out there compares."
2023-03-10,What app are you using to measure FOV?
2023-03-10,I wonder if you could use the actual app for measuring FOV. From what I remember it requires only 5$ to donate to the creator. It would be nice to know specific fov numbers.
2023-03-10,"> So to compare FOV I loaded in to the SteamVR grid in both,

If you want to measure the FOV a little more exactly you can use:

https://www.infinite.cz/projects/HMD-tester-virtual-reality-headset-database-utility"
2023-03-10,"Could you please test the FOV using Risa2000's tool? Or even just TestHMD, just to get some more objective numbers.

>there is no 3.5mm jack

Wow, I didn't know that. I absolutely hate this trend. Is there a usb C port on it for at least connecting headphones with a dongle? As much as that sucks..."
2023-03-21,"From what I read, you may be more picky than the average user"
2023-04-01,"My day 2 review...don't bother, it sucks. My Q2 is better in every way. Sending this POS back."
2023-03-10,"Good points. Well as for form factor, as I say it's no doubt awesome for carrying around, but I think it's otherwise to its detriment. The small FOV is of course the biggest drawback I suppose. It really is tiny though, it's impressive in that regard lol.

Diopter must be great for glasses wearers, but I have one 20/20 eye (or close enough) and one bad eye which can't be corrected.

I should of also mentioned it has about the same binocular overlap as the Pro, that is to say it's not all that great."
2023-03-10,"For people with astigmatism, I think 1/3 of people, then diopter adjustment might not be enough. Just wanted to note that, I still need to check myself. I am hoping it will be enough!"
2023-03-10,"I will never buy a headset with no audio jack, lol. Maybe if it has audio to rival a $200 pair of headphones, but even then I mostly like to game with my Kat Walk omni treadmill and you really want headphones to block out the sounds of you running on it"
2023-03-10,"every phone, laptop, vr headset that doesnt include one was a mistake

i really hope this doesnt also become a trend with headsets"
2023-03-10,"I'd honestly choose the Pico 4 really, unless you want to avoid Bytedance too."
2023-03-10,"Bigscreen looks awesome yeah, now if if only they did a wireless module..."
2023-03-10,">I think this is a solid option for folks who will simply never purchase a Meta/Bytedance headset.

Sure, if you want a streaming-only PCVR headset.

It is a terrible choice if you want a MobileVR headset that actually has content."
2023-03-25,"Hey! That's me!

I've been waiting for another company to do a wireless system and do it well. That's a big deal for me.

However, having a Steam Deck and seeing what Valve did there for a mobile OS, it kinda makes me curious if Valve is going down the standalone round with the Deckard... I kinda want to wait and see what Valve's gonna do."
2023-03-10,No just normal customer on Amazon
2023-03-10,"Well it tracks well and controllers are nice, and the image is very good. However I can't get past feeling its a step backwards in fov, mostly it's the limited downward view that bothers me most, which is worse in cockpit games.

You can if course totally enjoy the headset if/when lost in a VR game though. My technical issues have been with the software crashing or not starting SteamVR properly, whereas Virtual Desktop always works flawlessly, so at least that will be a big bonus when it drops for the Elite."
2023-03-17,If you look away from your G2 controller it doesn't spazz out all over the screen anymore?
2023-03-10,"I'd say the Elite is more comfy if only beacuse the Pro would hurt my forehead. Oh and the Elite has slightly less SDE. But the clarity of the Pro literally hit me every time I put it on, the Elite is no way as impressive."
2023-03-10,"It’s probably marketed towards people who want a standalone VR headset that’s not owned by Meta/Bytedance, I don’t see why anyone else would buy it over the pro."
2023-03-31,I own both headsets and I’m so unimpressed by the XR Elite I’m about to list for sale. Tons of bugs and issues and constant crashes and freezing… I’m very disappointed and the Quest Pro is vastly superior in all manners other than form factor. Streaming from pc works but is very unreliable and unpolished.  The pro is a bargain at its current value. I’ve owned most mainstream headsets. The XR elite feels like years old software with some new technology. Pass on this mates.
2023-03-10,"Sorry yes, I meant the Pico 4, edited accordingly. Thanks."
2023-03-10,Why does it have 2?
2023-03-11,"Agreed. After returning my Quest 2 because of poor fit and comfort, this HTC sounded promising. Especially the compactness, the weight balance, and the adjustable diopter. But lack of 3.5mm jack is just silly. Why force us to use wireless when our ears are literally millimeters away from the headset.

Hopefully the Quest 3 will retain the 3.5mm jack."
2023-03-10,What does brightness have to do with color?
2023-03-10,"Colour is good, but not as bright, but to be fair that's generally a known trade off when using pancake lenses. It's why Sony use Fresnel in the PSVR2 for the extra brightness and their HDR, and I'm glad they did at least.

If the PSVR2 has shown anything, it's that OLED blacks combined with a brighter than typical display adds so much. Driving at night in GT7 with a cars headlights right behind in the mirror feels so much more real visually than any other headset I've tried."
2023-03-10,"No app currently, I explain in the post what I did. It doesn't provide numbers, but clearly shows the difference. I will look into getting software to measure it though."
2023-03-10,"Well the diopter adjustment could be a huge deal for glasses wearers so that's a huge plus probably.

I didn't keep my Pro. Like many have now noted, it was extremely uncomfortable after a bit of use, though an extra head strap apparently fixes that. The display is amazingly clear and 100% edge to edge really, but has noticeable SDE and two I tried had same obvious pixel inversion (diagonal lines visible with head movement).

Personally I'm sticking with my Quest 2 for wireless PCVR for now. It has elite battery strap and a VR Cover mask. If I had to choose Pro or Elite, it would definitely be the Pro though."
2023-03-10,"Just remember that apps can only measure the logical FOV, not the actual FOV.

They will only tell you what FOV the vendor set to fill the display. They don't tell you anything about how much of your real FOV that will correspond to."
2023-03-10,"Tried that, controllers wouldn't do anything, and in SteamVR it does even allow me to alter bindings like other headsets do."
2023-03-10,"I will look into testing fov later.

There is a USB C, but that's needed for the battery, a powe bank if in glasses mode, or pc if tethered. Can't remember if there's a second now, I'm not home but I don't remember seeing one."
2023-03-22,"Probably, but at this price point I think enthusiast level pickiness is fair."
2023-03-30,"same

&#x200B;

I'll be sticking with my G2"
2023-03-10,">I should of also mentioned it has about the same binocular overlap as the Pro,

Really? Reviews I've read elsewhere about the Pro said that the XR Elite definitely comes out ahead in that metric."
2023-03-10,"About the binocular overlap, you can test this objectively with the Risa2000 hmdq app. (https://risa2000.github.io/hmdgdb/).

You can actually contact the creator and submit your test results, since you are one of the first users with an XR Elite.  Just don't alter the output file (including renaming it) before submission."
2023-03-10,"Kind of already is, or has been, my HP Reverb G2, which was my first headset, doesn't have a 3.5mm jack and that sort of set the expectations for me.  


Maybe the XR Elite could accomodate headphones via bluetooth or USB C?"
2023-03-30,"if that type of adapter works with xr elite, I might get it"
2023-03-30,I haven't gotten it yet. I'll make my own judgment.
2023-03-10,"From what I've heard, if you can even GET a Pico 4 in the United States, the QC is absolutely a disaster. No one should order a Pico 4 until they can buy it from a regular retailer with a 30 day return policy."
2023-03-10,"Almost went with the Pico 4, but they make it pretty annoying to order in the US; and Bytedance was basically just another nail in the coffin.  



I know HTC are also probably as bad, but these days I feel like I'm stuck making choices around the lesser of evils.

I do intend for a huge amount of my time to be spent in glasses mode, so getting even more lightweight was a big motivator."
2023-03-30,"Now that I've used one, I'd also take a Q2 over it.  Though I've opted for the QP instead."
2023-03-15,Yes that would have made the difference for me too.
2023-03-10,This is a dumb argument.  The Quest didn't have a whole lot of content at first.  The content will come.
2023-03-11,Damm should've ordered mine through Amazon
2023-03-10,"Ah, I don't mind the minor things like vertical fov, and the software issues can be patched.  So long as it's wireless, no Facebook, and works I'll be happy.  I've come from two WMR headsets so I'm not particularly picky about these things lol."
2023-03-17,"Nah, that never happened.  Worse thing is that it would sometimes take half a second to regain tracking if held outside is view for too long.  Stuff like grabbing over my shoulder or ammo from my side worked fine if done quick."
2023-03-11,"Did you ever try a top strap with the Pro Adam? I found it excrutiangly unpleasant to wear out of the box, but with the Creative Studioform top strap the forehead pressure was completely eliminated and its now the most comfortable headset I've used."
2023-03-10,These: https://www.meta.com/ie/quest/accessories/quest-pro-vr-earphones/
2023-03-10,I’ve only used my Pro for ~2 days but wasn’t even aware of the second headphone jack
2023-03-10,I assumed it meant color dimness.
2023-03-10,Indeed the brightness and colors on PSVR2 are great but I wish they had done something about the persistence blur when moving your head. It's the one big drawback.
2023-03-11,"They do not all work like that. TestHMD for example is based on the person, while Risa2000 measures the rendered FoV."
2023-03-11,"I use a very analogous method to compare the FOVs of headsets as follows:

Stand in front of a bright small window or doorway while wearing your headset.

Compare its FOV with the real scenery by lifting the headset a bit for several times.

Go forth and back until the FOV matches well the range of the window or doorway.

Get the position of the toe of your shoes an put there the middle of a wooden folding rule two meters long forming a V.

Use a protractor to measure the angle towards the side beams at the position you reached."
2023-03-10,That's absolutely wild if there's no way to have a wired audio solution!
2023-03-10,"I don't have to Pro now to compare side by side, but the overlap isn't great, maybe it's my weird face lol."
2023-03-10,"Hello, it looks like you've made a mistake.

It's supposed to be could've, should've, would've (short for could have, would have, should have), never could of, would of, should of.

Or you misspelled something, I ain't checking everything.

Beep boop - yes, I am a bot, don't botcriminate me."
2023-03-10,"Ah interesting, I will look this up later."
2023-03-10,"Bluetooth can be tricky. First of all it’s lossy and secondly depending on bluetooth version and codec latency can get quite high, so for gaming it’s not a great choice.

HP Reverb G2 doesn’t have audio jack, but pretty good integrated audio solution. XR Elite nor Pico 4 have good integrated audio. To be precise it’s pretty bad. So is Quest 2, but at least it’s got audio jack."
2023-03-10,"G2 and Index are the only acceptable exceptions as they have best in class audio built in, but even then they should still have a 3.5mm jack.

Pico 4 drove me nuts with it.

Vive Pro also doesn't have it but has okay built in audio so maybe forgivable. 

Really though, they just all should have it."
2023-03-10,"In glasses mode for me the arms do squeeze my head pretty tight, more than I'd like tbh. I suppose it's just a case of getting used to it though.

I actually thought it came with the little case to carry in glasses mode, but that's my mistake I guess, it just comes with a soft bag."
2023-03-15,"Soon Lynx R1 will enter the frame only problem is if you wanted an increase in FOV it will not offer that. However they are very open about everything, are encouraging developers and accessory creators to use the headset however they want, CAD files are available for anyone to use. They have an amazing passthrough, headphone jack and micro SD card slot. Lynx R1 is the headset."
2023-03-10,"It is not a dumb argument. We are talking about HTC.

Meta has pumped millions of dollars a year for the last 4 years into MobileVR content. With what we know about HTC are you really going to claim they are going to do that? 🤣"
2023-03-12,"No, no it won't."
2023-03-30,"Eh, I can wait. HP Reverb G2 is still awesome, only the portability factor is something that could be better. And tracking (well, lighthouses don't make portability better, but if I also wanted a stationary setup, I might as well get a used index for that if at that point There's still nothing on the horizon for Valve)

I can wait with the XR Elite. The store seems incredibly underwhelming too"
2023-03-12,"I ordered through amazon in early Feb, and still don't have it. Based on the reports of people receiving them already, it would seem that the shipments are time gated by region and North America seems to be last in line.

The order of appearances so far seems to have been, Australia, Korea, Germany, misc Europe, UK..."
2023-04-02,"Glad to have saved you some money :) I am loving the PSVR2 despite the mura, I absolutely love how bright it can be combined with the real OLED blacks!

I hope Valve come out with something this decade!"

2023-03-17,Same here 😅
2023-03-25,"ugh yeah I feel ya, fellow G2 owner. So many times where stuff happened and I'd just be like ""why, WMR? Why?"""

2023-03-11,No but I have heard it makes a huge difference!
2023-03-30,"I haven't bought an XR elite because I already own the Pro but from reviews It's got a higher PPD than the Quest 2, and has pancake lenses

But it's also nearly 3x the price for an upgrade that isn't huge, especially when the Pro's $100 less than the XR and better."
2023-03-10,Thats actually pretty cool.
2023-03-10,"Sorry, my brain is very pedantic when reading text. What is ""color dimness""?

In my head, ""dimness"" is how bright something, as in how much light is reflected. Not what color that light is."
2023-03-10,And the damn mura
2023-03-11,"Yes, the do. *Software based test can literally not measure the physical FOV angle,* they measure the widest *logical* FOV that you can see. It is literally impossible for the software to measure the physical FOV because the software has to assume that the FOV reported by the headset is correct.

All the software can do is tell the headset to render something. It has to assume that the logical viewport reported by the headset is correct.

Even if the headset reports the correct number for the hardware for some imagined ideal user, where -45/+45 as displayed by the headset will actually show up in **your** FOV depends a great deal on how the headset fits you. The software has no way of knowing the physical reality.

**The only way to measure the physical FOV is with a physical setup that actually measures the FOV of the edges of the display as seen through the lenses.**

The *TestHMD* mentions how they have to rely on info from the manufacturer:

> It also conforms to the maximum degress expressed by the manufacturer through SteamVR or OpenVR.

That is pretty much useless when what you are trying to do is find out if the manufacturer's numbers are correct."
2023-03-11,"Lol well I could do that, but instead I used TestHMD and there's another post with my results."
2023-03-10,"Yeah looking at it now, only one USB C port, and that will always be used by something. Crazy!"
2023-03-10,"No offense but, maybe?  


To be fair, stories like your's aren't unheard of and maybe bigscreen with its custom facial interfaces really are on the right track."
2023-03-10,I was quoting.
2023-03-31,"Did you know that the tiny Big Screen Beyond has a binocular overlap of 85, while the much bigger Varjo Aero is 70? Or that the rendered vertical FOV is 89 vs 85 by just looking at the two HMDs?  Pimax has been BSing the Crystal's FOV numbers by ~20 degrees for over a year, guess how people found out its actually directly comparable to the 1/4 as expensive PICO 4?

It takes two seconds on the users end, and having objective numbers and all of the 3D diagrams provided is important. Having numbers for shit no one's tried like the StarVR is also very cool, and I imagine that's why Risa exists and its creator asks for crowd sourced data. Especially when people with different faces keep on posting subjective numbers using the ROV app instead of objective testers like Risa. Or saying over and over again ""X headset feels like (blank) compared to the Quest 2/Valve Index"". So boring, and that doesn't do anything for people like me who don't own either."
2023-03-30,nice thank you for the info
2023-03-11,My USB C audio adapters work with the Pico 4! Perhaps you can get the best possible sound this way.
2023-03-30,">Not good for cable PCVR.

Good to know but it's unlikely that would be my use case with the XR Elite if I get it."
2023-03-15,"I would say listen to your body if it feels tight from the get go that's a bad sign. Just like with shoes or clothes, items that go on your body need to fit properly."
2023-03-10,Facebook pumped millions of dollars into studios that only released one game and did nothing after.  Plus the vast majority of Quest games are mobile quality shit.  Most of the best stuff is also on PCVR.
2023-03-12,"I agree. I didn’t buy it so it’s a horrible generic perpetual prealpha for know nothing gamers that got universally bad reviews. Trust me. I know, and hate everything."
2023-03-26,I never had issues in wmr. Idk if you run Amd.. because I know that was a factor back then.
2023-03-30,Oh I know lol.  I already sent it back.  Just picked up a Quest Pro today.  I hate Facebook but it seems like if you want wireless PCVR it's the only option.
2023-03-10,"Why would that give offence lol? Holding a controller out in front and moving it out to side, it disappears from one eye sooner than other headsets. I have average 63.5 ipd."
2023-03-10,Lol bot must've been sleeping when I said it.
2023-03-11,"Yeah definitely an option, just sucks if someone wants to use the upcoming facial tracker/eye tracking as those will populate both usb C ports. A 3.5mm jack really wouldn't have added any bulk."
2023-03-10,"Don't waste your time, he's a Fanboy. Never discuss with fanboy. Look at his Reddit history. He probably pass more time discussing about how great the headset that he just bought is... rather than really using it."
2023-03-10,"Pretty sure game development takes time. I think it’s delusional to think the studios are in idle mode just being paid to do nothing? Is that something you believe? Also, what’s the point in shitting on the quest mobile games when it’s the exact same for HTC?"
2023-03-10,"Cool story bro, and exactly what does that have to do with MobileVR content from HTC? 

Good games can take years. There is no way that HTC will pony up the money necessary to compete with Meta in MobileVR."
2023-03-12,"This is the dumbest thing I've read all day.  They are taking their time rather than rishing games and then you complain about game quality.  Totally out of touch with reality.  And no one calls Nintendo Switch games ""mobile"" despite using nearly identical chips.  Again, completely out of touch."
2023-03-27,"I do, but I also don’t. If you’re referring to the AMD Mainboard issues with the V1 cable, I never had that, I only pretty recently got the V2 version of the headset, and it worked fine. But sometimes, I’d have freezing, stutters, black screens, popups from WMR for no reason (saying stuff like IP address not found) and I don’t know… just some instability. That was with my AMD Nvidia laptop. Since running with my desktop with gtx 1080 and intel chip, it has felt a lot more stable. The fact I can just turn on my pc now and just put the headset on to get into beatsaber, without ever seeing a display, is really cool, though. :) overall I’m very happy, don’t get me wrong :)"
2023-03-11,"Ahhhhh, found it lol"
2023-03-10,"Right? It's hassling me quoting you but not you, bad bot."
2023-03-30,">My reviews are legit. Quest 2, is a better headset.

Ok, I mean, I'm gonna try it for myself, regardless of what you say, but I just find this in particular to be hard to believe.  


Who knows, maybe a month from now I'll be like, ""wow that guy was right"" but we'll see."
2023-03-12,All day? Try all year! I may have never read anything dumber. They should read some reviews instead of being a know nothing gamer who only plays perpetual prealphas.
2023-03-11,"Seems basically impossible to meaningfully use that 2nd one, but I'd love to hear that you can plug a wire into that and still put the headset on your face normally."
2023-03-30,"I have tried a bunch of those adapters and none have worked for usb C data, only power deliver. I'm sure some do, it's just an oddly tricky thing to buy. 

The issue with the elite is the small form factor means very limited space for these types of things, and both the facial tracker and eye tracker almost certainly will use the usb C port as the mount (like with the Focus 3 for the same peripherals) so using an adapter isn't an option.

That said, I have heard that the audio is actually very good on the XR elite, like better than expected anyway."
2023-03-11,Guessing it's pretty much exclusively for the eye tracking module.
2023-03-11,"That's what I was thinking as well, but I want to be wrong.

The next step would be to try a ribbon style extension, there might be enough clearance for that, and then just pop your 3.5mm usb c adapter into that end.

**Edit:

Looks like USB-C to 3.5mm adapters should fit snugly into that 2nd port without any issues.
https://i.imgur.com/ne1YJIl.jpg

I didn't realize there would be this much clearance for it outside the shroud, but from what I'm seeing here, using wired headphones should be as simple as plugging in a $10 adapter."
2023-03-30,"Tested USB-C to 3.5mm in the accessory port, $9 part, it worked fine.  No need for the combo power/3.5mm adapter.

2023-03-30,"> Unless you add an eye and face module

Fair point, I'd basically forgotten that was coming down the road."
2023-10-05,"I have one. Their software is garbage, and no glasses support is frustrating. It also breaks quite frequently in our hardware QA as users as it’s just not as durable physically.  Link mode disconnects frequently if you don’t set it up the right way. It could be Vive business streaming doesn’t work well. 

It is super light. I want to like it. Hand tracking is nice too. The camera is too zoomed in for pas through too. 

It’s definitely a nice prototype hardware. It just needs another revision to be awesome."
2023-10-05,"I think I would have loved the XR Elite a lot if they went with an entirely different strap design and had native PCVR support. I couldn't use it at all without the battery as it hurt my head from where it grips. The face pad was also uncomfortable and the compression when playing PCVR is worse than the Quest 2. Even with a 4090 doing the heavy lifting. The lens also had a lot more glare than I was expecting. Having the QPro right next to it probably didn't help because the lens are truly ahead of everything else in the QPro. QPro lens inside the XR Elite + a better headstrap = yes! lol
 

That said, the form factor itself is awesome from technical perspective. When I opened the box and pulled it out of that little cloth bag, my brain instantly went ""damn, HTC. You just set the bar and I just found my new headset."". The form factor alone gave me that impression. It's really unfortunate the rest of the experience didn't pan out to be like that initial wow from the form factor."
2023-10-05,"I pretty much agree with you, but it also needs a price reduction. I own a Qpro, had an XRE, I legitimately liked the XRE but I couldn't pass up all the bonuses of the Qpro (eye, face, local dimming, self tracked controllers, a real dock..) for the price. If the XRE was fighting the quest 3 at the 500-700$ price point I think it's a much closer fight. 

My only problems with the XRE was that it barely fit my face and the controllers were garbage. I used it only for pcvr and for that it was good.. Vd recognized it as a quest 2 and with a Tundra tracker mounted to it I was able to do FBT with it. I'm probably one of the few people to do that."
2023-10-05,If they could make it $500 I would probably buy one.  Get rid of the XR stuff.  Get rid of the standalone.  That's what I would tell them to do.
2023-10-05,"I agree. Vive always feels just a year or so off of target. This headset, 1 year before its release, would've been awesome. If they refresh it, something else slightly better will come out first."
2023-11-17,Have you had a chance to try the Quest 3? Any thoughts on comparison? Thanks for the detailed insight
2023-10-05,">Their software is garbage

I use Vive Streaming with a Wifi 6E router and in my case I think their software works really well. YMMV.  


""It’s definitely a nice prototype hardware. It just needs another revision to be awesome.""  


Honestly, probably not an unfair assessment."
2023-10-05,On top of all those... its paying BSB full set price... for worse tracking and substantially worse displays...
2023-10-05,">and had native PCVR support.

I am strongly inclined to agree, they would steal shiftall's thunder if they had implemented a way to feed native displayport into the XR Elite, I would feel really interested in giving up my Reverb G2 if I could also switch it to a proper tethered mode.

But in my hypothetical consultant mode, I would have to know that I would get pushback that putting in native displayport is difficult because the snapdragon xr2 doesn't support it natively and it would probably require a bunch more stuff that would add cost, size, and weight and so it goes.

""I couldn't use it at all without the battery as it hurt my head from where it grips.""

Ah, my secret, I have long thick hair that acts as a cushion and I can go 40-60 minutes before I need to take a quick 'break' where I hold the grips away from my head for 30-60 seconds and then I can go another 40-60 minutes. Over on the Vive discord, some people recommend wearing a beanie. YMMV.

But I agree with you in principle, they really need to offer a perhaps oversize but maxed out comfort alternate grips. It's a good little headset that really just needs a comfort/wearability overhaul (and better lenses but the problem is, the Quest Pro lenses are meta proprietary, you're never going to get THOSE lenses into the XR Elite)."
2023-10-05,"Honestly, what I really think the XR Elite needs is a bigscreen beyond style custom facial interface that would bring the eyes as close as practical, it would be more comfortable but also the stock interface does the lenses a disservice, it keeps the eyes too far away, undermining the FOV and increasing the glare.  


I tried looking through the XR Elite with the interface off and the optical stack felt practically upgraded by the experience.   


I'm telling you, the one size fits most approach to facial interfaces can't survive the long term transition towards 'goggles/glasses' form factor headsets."
2023-10-05,">I pretty much agree with you, but it also needs a price reduction.

In my hypothetical consultant example, I don't think I would advocate a price reduction, they're different use cases but the bigscreen beyond being backordered, the Varjo Aero being backordered at the 1000 dollar price point, and the Crystal apparently selling well despite its beta software, shows that there is a market for an expensive but perceived high value headset.

I don't know what kind of numbers internally HTC needs to hit but I don't think that they can beat Facebook at their own game. It's not 2021 anymore, Mark Zuckerberg can't set money on fire like he used to but he can still be aggressive with price in a way that apparently HTC can't.

I think maybe reduce the price to 999, ya know, the psychological barrier, and then tack on as many improvements as possible at that price point, ideally including the planned eye and face tracking accessory in the box."
2023-10-05,"Heh, when I first set it up, the setup room was literally tens of meters away from my location. I was in the clouds with that fun whale flying by, in front of me! All sorts of resetting and restarting still had me far away in the distance.

I ended up finding a trick online about teleporting yourself forward to eventually get to the right spot to make it work and continue setup.

Once things got going it was not so bad admittedly."
2023-10-08,"The BSB and XR Elite are apples and oranges, quite different use cases.

Also, the tracking is actually really fucking good, I play a lot of games where I need to move my hands around a lot but also be really careful and precise and honestly, it never lets me down.  


You base station owners think your squeaky laser emitters are the only way to get really good tracking but the whole rest of the VR space is moving on without you."
2023-10-05,"The aero, crystal, and bsb are superior to the q3 though, whereas the XRE gets beat in every way by the 500$ q3 aside from being smaller. The 1k price could have flown a little better when it's competition was the Qpro (and Pico 4 if you're spicey) but now I'm thinking they should try to sell for any profit they can before they end up selling none at all"
2023-10-08,">The BSB and XR Elite are apples and oranges, quite different use cases.

The XR Elite has some very niche things that the 1/3 cheaper and superior in most aspects (Quest pro) can pretty much do. Maybe not switching batteries... and that's about it I think?

>Also, the tracking is actually really fucking good, I play a lot of games where I need to move my hands around a lot but also be really careful and precise and honestly, it never lets me down.

What is good now isn't the same as 2016 anymore. I had what you describe back in 2016 with the OG Vive, it took camera solutions a while to get there, and it still doesn't have a decent solution for full body tracking (if that is your jam) or has issues tracking your controllers when out of view (unless you are using a Quest Pro).

To be fair, nowadays is not a big issue, or something noticeable unless you are going to the absolute extremes. But again, every time we buy HMDs, we aren't forced to change controllers, or buy again a whole new tracking system of cameras and CPUs.

>the whole rest of the VR space is moving on without you.

That would be true, in a world where the Bigscreen Beyond (from 2023) doesn't exist... or the Pimax Crystal (from 2023)... or the MeganeX (from 2023)... or the Varjo Aero (from 2022)... How is having top of the line HMDs being left behind exactly?"
2023-10-05,">whereas the XRE gets beat in every way by the 500$ q3 aside from being smaller.

I really wish they had made the XR Elite a little bigger and made sure the base model had eye tracking with wireless compression guided by dynamic foveated rendering, that would've given it a clear edge over the Quest 3 and made it toe to toe with the Quest Pro.  


Adding eye tracking via a combined face and eye tracking accessory that isn't even out yet was a huge mistake."
2023-10-08,"You can come back in the future to laugh at me but I'm gonna make a prediction right now, I would even bet money on it, actually I already have bet money on it by NOT investing in base stations...  


**This is the last generation of consumer-level HMD's which require lighthouses.**  


Meta, the biggest game in town, won't ever touch them and the Quest Pro Controllers can do everything that base station controllers can do and some things better. Neither will Pico. HTC is moving on from them with their inside out tracked devices including the first ever inside out tracked FBT. Pimax's reality series will only touch them as an optional accessory.   


I'm calling it like I see it but the MeganeX, whenever it releases, will be the last new HMD with mandatory lighthouse tracking. After that, the lighthouses are an evolutionary dead end in the consumer space.  


Especially if the Valve Index's successor doesn't require light houses, that'll be the beginning of the end."
2023-10-09,"Exactly,  correct.

That is exactly what I was discussing on a different comment thread.
The beyond is oriented to people that ALREADY have base stations. Most people that bought them back in 2016 with the OGVive,  or in 2019 with the index. That's why they don't even bother selling them in a pack with base stations or controllers.

(The meganex has been already released btw, you can even try it at specialized stores around here in Japan.)

Also, there will be a couple more base station HMDs, but nothing crazy. Buying them was a good idea last decade, not this one.
Rumors point towards Valve switching too. Tracking with cameras is good enough, and they are getting the taste of mobile hardware from the Deck."
2023-10-09,">(The meganex has been already released btw,

Oh wow, people REALLY aren't talking about it in North America, I visit this subreddit every day and this is the first I'm hearing of it.

But ok, my prediction would be, after 2024, there will never be another hmd released, **at the consumer level,** that only has lighthouse tracking as an option.

Edit:

Wait a minute, even lighthouse tracking is only an option for the Meganex ""6DoF head tracking with Inside-out"", it requires an additional adapter that isn't even included in the box.

I wonder when they made this change cause when I first heard about the MeganeX a year or so ago, it was supposed to be lighthouse only.

I guess that's another sign the era of lighthouse tracking is coming to an end.

2023-10-09,"""at the consumer level, that only has lighthouse tracking as an option.""
Yeah, that sounds about right, after 2024 if things don't change. 

Trust me, the Meganex is ""lighthouse only"" lol

It actually was the other way around.  They wanted to make their own tracking solution, controllers and everything... but it just wasn't up to current standards like things like the quest do. So... since they had the idea to make it base station compatible... they turned it into the main way to use it lol

It is included with all units now. I think you can opt out on the business version though."
2023-10-09,"Okay, got home now.
