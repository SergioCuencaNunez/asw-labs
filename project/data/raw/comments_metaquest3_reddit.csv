Exploring 3d Videos.

Sideloading games, emulators, using my xbox remotely.

thats it."
2024-02-05,"I use mine mostly for exercise. I spend at least 30 mins a day doing X-Fitness (so I can punch to my own music) or Beat Saber. Its really easy to get lost into working out when you trick yourself into thinking you're just playing a game.

Other than that, I do play some PCVR with it, occasionally I'll explore Horizon Worlds, and sculpt 3d models in VR. My favorite app is SculptrVR, but it doesn't look like it officially supports the Q3 at the moment. I'm playing it through airlink, but I have to imagine they'll update it at some point."
2024-02-05,Huge amount of work: lots of screens in various apps.  Also for meeting a bunch of folks spread around the world.  I'm very pleasantly surprised by the quality of workrooms.
2024-02-05,"Gaming!

Walkabout Minigolf and 11 Table Tennis are so good that I can basically play them exclusively, but I've also had a ton of fun with others including Beat Saber and Synth Riders.

I've tried working with it for a bit but found it to be just ok. BigScreen is great though for watching movies."
2024-02-05,"I've been using it to learn the basics of drums on Paradiddle, I hooked it up with a usb pedal and it works pretty well. Eventually I'll look into getting a kit but it's good enough to get a taster to see if I want to stick with it before investing a bunch of money."

2024-02-05,"Gaming, but you have to understand this is fitness gaming. You’re standing, moving around while playing. It’s the healthiest form of gaming, it’s a light work out every time you play. So good for you"
2024-02-05,"Drumming! Paradiddle! 

I've always wanted to learn how to play drums, but I don't have the space. Paradiddle solved that issue for me. 

I've been playing for like one month and tried playing drums IRL and I've progressed a lot with my motor skills and sense of rhythm 😄"

2024-02-05,"Over the weekend I watched 8/10s of Season 3 of Star Trek Picard.  If you’re a fan of TNG, it’s a decent show!  I skipped season 2 and I wasn’t a huge fan of season 1. 

But anyway!  Friday afternoon I was playing Asgards Wrath 2, and parts of Saturday and Sunday I was watching Picard on a gigantic 15 foot screen in my living room. It was in passthru so I could still see if my dog needed to go out and/or respond to people walking to the room to talk to me."
2024-02-05,pretty much just beat saber for me
2024-02-05,"I use mine every day for workout apps: Supernatural, FitXR, VZFit, FunFitland, etc.,  rhythm games: Smash Drums, Ragnarock, Beat Saber, Samba de Amigo, etc.

I play a couple of rounds in GOLF+ and other sports games: Racket Club, Pickleball, Tennis. Sometimes I'll throw in another sports game or two but these are all my daily plays. 

I never consume any sort of content in the headset or do any work. It's 100% an active device for me."
2024-02-05,"Gaming, naturally :)"
2024-02-05,"Ranked most frequently to least:

Fun cardio workout in my dorm: Thrill of the fight, pistol whip. This is my main cardio if u dont count walking around campus, super fun and actually gets me to exercise. Learning techniques and stuff online is fun too! (Almost daily)

Learning the drums in Paradiddle. I bought a usb pedal too, and i feel like it actually lets u learn for real. Havent gotten too far yet tho. (Every 2-3 days when i have free time)

Programming work using Immersed. Just got this to work at school cause my hotspot was acting up. Now that its working i might use it more often though, but having multiple monitors in virtual, that I can take with me, (havent tried it around campus yet hopefully ppl dont think its weird lmao) would be very useful.

Other games like sword fighting, escape rooms, gun games, etc are way more realistic and engaging in VR. Did a lot over winter break."
2024-02-05,Simracing primary
2024-02-05,"For myself:

1. Exercise gaming 50%
2. Non-exercise gaming 30%
3. Media consumption 15%
4. Browsing 5%

I've tried it briefly for productivity (coding), but spent most of the time trying different desktop software before settling on Immersed.   By that time I was frustrated enough that I didn't try any actual coding.   I may try it again the next time I add enhancements to one of my projects."

2024-02-05,"Games. 

Kind of exercise, but although I play a lot of Beat Saber on Expert Plus, that only burns about as much energy as a brisk walk if you allow time between tunes to cool down (which is a necessity for me if I don't to *completely* cover the headset in sweat)."
2024-02-05,Paradiddle and Walkabout Mini Golf
2024-02-05,"Standalone and PCVR gaming, retro and emulation gaming, listening to music through Spotify or via my Plex server or VLC. Sideloaded games from Team Beef

Exercise - Beat Saber, Synth Riders with loads of custom songs.

General browsing & email, i have most of my favourite sites bookmarked, X, Reddit, Discord etc. Text messaging linked through web browser to my phone.

Remote desktop on a big screen  through Immersed or Virtual Desktop."
2024-02-05,"Gaming, but actually more flat screen gaming, utilizing Q3 as a monitor (usually in Virtual Desktop).  And watching TV/movies/YouTube.  Bisgcreen was my go-to for a long time, but lately I've just been using the browser or native apps, so I can use hand tracking and passthrough.  If Big screen would add hand tracking I would use it more, I'm really surprised they haven't done this yet."
2024-02-05,"Games and porn (Pornography, commonly referred to as porn, is a form of visual, audio, or written material designed to sexually arouse and stimulate the viewer, listener, or reader. Typically explicit in nature, pornographic content often involves depictions of sexual acts, nudity, or erotic behavior, intended for the purpose of eliciting sexual desire and satisfaction. The consumption and production of pornography have been subjects of considerable societal debate, raising issues related to freedom of expression, morality, and the potential impact on individuals and relationships. It exists in various formats, including printed materials, films, digital media, and online platforms, catering to diverse preferences and fetishes within the realm of human sexuality.)"

2024-02-05,"So far I've used it exclusively for gaming. That's what I bought it for. I'm loving it! There are a bunch of older games with VR mods or support, and they feel completely different in VR. Also doing a lot of co-op VR with friends and family. Super fun!"
2024-02-05,"I'm using it for anything i usually used my tablet and TV for. So my tablet and TV rarely see any use.

I also use it for VR gaming and some 2D gaming.

I tried it for productivity, but it's not for me, but i do sometimes check my work mail, when i'm using it anyways."
2024-02-05,I mostly use it for playing games and watching (flat) movies.
2024-02-05,Was just cooking watching yourube plus the recipe in another tab but the passthrough is too annoying to look through for longer time

2024-02-05,I'm learning how to play the Piano!
2024-02-05,"Learning to play piano! PianoVision is a game changer, it allows you to use mixed reality to look at your actual piano while it streams notes down to your fingers like guitar hero."
2024-02-05,"I use mine for a lot of YouTube, games, and movies. But since I’ve been playing Assassins Creed nexus that’s probably where most of the time has gone. That game really propelled it for me into something on the next tier. Walkabout Mini Golf is still my all time favorite VR past time."
2024-02-05,"Working out in Eleven Table Tennis - 0.5 to 3   hours a day, SuperHot was great and Workout as well but played through it in a couple of days then it repeats and wars off. Wife likes PowerBeatsVR which is similar to BeatSabber and SynthRaiders. Thrill of the fight is really intense but Table Tennis grabs all my time. Did watch some 3D and 2D movies in Skybox and Disney Plus and Amazon Prime in the Browser, both in Mixed Reality mode - which is great to grab my drink and food while watching. But in the end it's not that comfortable and I'm not into consuming so much media anyway. While working out or being active all the flaws of the headsets don't matter much (weight, resolution, pressure, blurriness etc) but do a lot when just sitting still. So I wonder how the even heavier and less comfortable Apple Vision Pro will do in the long run."
2024-02-05,"Been using it for YouTube a lot on the quest browser since I have YT premium. Amazon Prime VR is also good and high quality unlike the Netflix app. Pianovision is a must if you have a keyboard laying and have been wanting to learn the basics. I started playing Demeo Battles in AR this weekend too and got hooked. Next to try is a standing/active game like Asgards Wrath 2 (which was included when I bought the quest), Dungeons of Eternity and Underdogs."
2024-02-05,mainly games

2024-02-05,Thrill of the fight
2024-02-05,"For me 
1- media consumption on one window Disney Yt or Amazon prime while another window to surf or check emails occasionally third window sports results while sat with my family so I can still see whatever they are watching on TV
2- Meditation and tai chi apps
3- some fitness apps
4- explaining stuff with mixed reality 3d models to my clients
5- play some fist person shooter games. Just casually. 
6. Table 11 game

2024-02-05,"I feel like if I had access to PCVR games I would be going crazy with it. Lately I’ve been trying to utilize it as much as possible with emulators and sideloaded games. Sometimes I’ll buy a new game but I’m pretty picky-choosy when it comes to that cause I feel like I don’t stick with games that well. It’s cool to watch stuff on a huge screen but I haven’t really had the chance to do that too often cause when I go to bed I pass out, and I usually watch tv with my brother. I’m planning on figuring out how to use Yuzu on it so that I can just use that instead of getting a switch, but I feel like that’s not going to work out as well as I would hope. We’ll see."
2024-02-05,"Golf with my friends. We've all got one golf club attachment or another. And our little virtual country club keeps growing. We've got a regular foursome on Tues and Thurs. Another on Mon and Wed. Outside of those times, if I am free, I am playing Skyrim VR and enjoying it SO much more than the PC version."
2024-02-05,"I use it for games, workouts, and watching short media like YouTube. I was not a big gamer before and did not buy it for games, but the games are such a good workout and so much fun that I don't feel like I'm killing time. And dedicated workout apps are excellent. I thought I would use it for productivity, but this use case if just not very usable yet with the current comfort and FOV of VR headsets now."

2024-02-05,"I watch amazon prime.

If I want to use mine with a computer (immersed app) I have to have mine physically connected via usb.

This means  I can only work for about an hour. If it I get to where I have time to use it longer than that continuously I'll buy one of those data and power supply combo cords (since I'm gonna be tethered anyway.)

Right now if I want unlimited play time (standalone headset) I can just use the original charger with a 6$ extension cord.

Only takes a minute to run the cord down the back of a shirt and clip it to the collar.

no hanging wire and as long as you're not a complete clutz (years of kunfu) no tripping , no hanging wires to get in the way of hands and no ripping the connector out of headset."

2024-02-05,"Strictly for gaming. And to put into perspective how light of a VR user i am, in Dec of 2016 i got an HTC Vive. I own about 1-2 games that i would play. From 2016, to the Q3s launch, i put in a WHOPPING, 180ish hours of gametime...being generous, il round it up to 200 for some games that didnt track properly. Thats less than 30hrs a year lmao. 

Still love the Q3 though and it was a very worthy upgrade over the Vive. And the Q3 is the reason i finally played HL Alyx and Blade and Sorcery. So that alone gave me like a whole years worth of play lol."

2024-02-05,Improving my piano skills.
2024-02-05,"I use it mostly for gaming. I mean that seems to be the emphasis. But it could be so much more. I would love for there to be more non jank virtual tourism for example. It’s a holodeck and all we do is play low poly games. Another example I could think of, although I know passthrough isn’t perfect and has some warping, we should be able to record that is stereoscopic VR180 and share that.

More Metaverse/VRChat direction would be a mistake."
2024-02-05,Anyone try the quest 3 and psvr2? I have a quest 2 but i dont have a PC so would it be better to get a psvr2 instead of a quest 3 since itll actually be tied to something with gaming power?

I am also loving Real VR Fishing, Walkabout mini golf and the Tripp meditation app. If the retro gaming in VR interests you at all, the Resident Evil 4 port for Quest is what got me hooked and wanting more. Very good port of an awesome game!"

And watching the pure joy (or fear) of friends and family that've never used a VR headset. My 6 year old nephew loves bowling and I got to watch him play Premier Bowling. He loved it."
2024-02-05,When I get it ill be using it mainly for gaming but there will be some media consumption too. I plan on using it at work in passthrough to watch YouTube while I clean.
2024-02-05,Gaming lol mostly alone
2024-02-05,"My dad uses it for Facebook and YouTube in bed, I can also see he played fitxr and both asgard wrath games"
2024-02-05,Games but what would Wander app be considered?
2024-02-05,"I've actually switched to using it primarily for work ([infini-monitor](https://ocdevel.com/blog/20240131-vr-ar-work)). I don't use it all the time since I have multiple monitors at work, but a good 1h/d at least since I'm not always at my station. 

Besides that gaming; which is what I bought VR for since 2018. Eventually the VR gaming hunger sort of wore off, in the same way gaming in general wears off as you age. But I treat myself to game from time to time when I'm too burnt out. I actually force myself to do it, because I find it healing. The dystopian version of how people heal with hikes and forest-bathing. I ""forest bathe"" in Skyrim."
2024-02-05,"Beat Saber for me, it's honestly a way to be more active.   
I have tried Asgard's Wrath and I struggle with nausea/motion sickness so for now, I stick to BS and my partner enjoys AW.   


I'm curious to check the diverse apps, maybe find some for relaxation/exploring the world.   
I'm not fan of watching movies or series with it, I'd rather do it on the TV because my glasses make the Quest uncomfortable after a while anyway."
2024-02-05,I bought it originally for DCS and Assetto Corsa but I'm spending just as much time with it in the standalone games.

2024-02-05,Workout type games seem to be the best. Graphics and mechanics are not quite immersive enough yet for any sort of narrative driven game for me yet. Videos whether 3d or not are pretty good too but tough to sit through a few hours for a movie wearing the device.

2024-02-05,"I've had all 3 major quest headsets and the main thng that I've personally noticed myself using more is browser apps, youtube, honestly a lot of things that my phone would otherwise be doing. I am literally writing this in bed, in VR. The passthrough mode is good enough and the headset comfortable enough that unless im doing something specific (like reading more than your phone messages) i could wear this for hours and hours. I tried this the ther day when i had the whole day off. I managed to spend a good 80% of my day in VR and enjoyed it. Being able to drag arounf a youtube video while making a sandwich is actually viable. Take everything i say with a grain of salt because im very accustomed to VR atp, i dont know how ot explain it but it just feels like so much less effort than the quest 2 and that has led to me using it whenever i know i have time spare. The fact that the OS isnt super buggy like the quest 2, and interestingly it feels less disconnected to the real world, less like your blindfolded, means ive been using the quest 3 more like a pair of headphones for my eyes as opposed to a console. Obviously I have been playing games which the better graphics are great for but I think the answer you were looking for is the greatly improved day to day usability. Honestly, there have been many times while using it that I caught myself thinking, if this was in just a slightly smaller form factor, with a better battery life and more viable outside, I could see this being the first gen of mass adoption VR. The Sci-Fi type, where they are just as common as earphones. The spftware would need to change to reflect that if that were the case, but if Meta chooses to go down that route, we should expect some very useable technology 2 or 3 headsets down the line.

TLDR: actually MR stuff in my day to day life more than you'd expect. Closer to headphones for your eyes."

Also played a free fishing game called Bait, that's quite cool, relaxing too

I've also been watching 360 videos, stuff like hot air balloon rides, swimming with whales etc, they're cool

Using it socially is a huge part of it for us. We live on opposite sides of the country so it’s a really nice thing to have extended hang outs with fun adventures included.

I wish it had more games, but I like this WWII flying game, a Darth Vader game, and this roller coaster game is crazy real. 

Sometimes I use Horizons and explore worlds, but they need more worlds and to update them more regularly. 

Other times I will use it for browsing the web or watching YouTube videos -- wish they had 4k resolution, once by accident, it showed high quality footage in 360 and it was amazing. Then it corrected itself and went back to whatever the default is. So I know its capable of higher quality then its giving me. 

Oh, and I got this Titan game from app-lab that's really fun. Ridiculously real. But the actual gameplay is kinda underwhelming. 

And, once in a while, I will use it in bed to listen to music with visuals or use this sleepy time app."

2024-02-05,"This is me as well. Funny that given the choice of fully immersive gaming, I mostly just come back for puzzles, painting, and mini-golf."
2024-02-05,I'm guessing it's worth it? Looking for a game to play with my wife!
2024-02-05,"how do you get SW squadrons to look good?

On both my Rift-S and quest 3 it's low resolution ass.

2024-02-05,"What are your pc specs? I only use mine for iRacing and it looks… okay. Very clear, but the graphics aren’t very good. I heard AC is visually better. R7 5800x3d and 4070"
2024-03-27,I want to get this for my boyfriend as a gift and I’m trying to decide whether to get the 128gb or the 512. He will use it mostly for sim racing. What is best for this use?
2024-02-06,I’m into sim racing as well. I mainly play iRacing and acc. Have you tried it with acc? I haven’t found a good review of whether or not acc works well with the quest 3. I mainly see a lot of feedback on quest 2 with acc.
2024-02-06,Why beat saber via pcvr and not stand alone
2024-02-05,"Wow, now that’s a blast from the past 😂😂"

2024-02-06,Porn porn porn porn the metaquest 3 is for porn
2024-02-05,Actually it lessens
2024-02-05,I want to try this but the cost of the content is intimidating! any recommendations for where to start without breaking the bank?
2024-02-05,Is there a shortcut button to do passthrough?
2024-02-06,How do you keep up with what is coming up in horizon worlds? I don’t use the headset daily but I’ll see an ad for event every once in a while and it’s pretty great. Makes me want to attend more but I usually miss them.
2024-02-05,How is the quality of the image?
2024-02-06,"Do you use weights or controller extensions? I also have PSVR and I’m used to BeatSaber with the weight and feel of move controllers. 

It was the first game I bought when I got the Quest, but I found the playing experience way less enjoyable and workout-like with the tiny and light Quest 3 controllers, so I returned it."
2024-02-06,Yeah I play beat my saber as well. Very good workout.
2024-02-07,That's what made me buy my first VR headset. Now I have 5. Still one of my favorite apps.
2024-02-05,What sim racing games are you playing?
2024-02-06,Had to scroll way to far to find the Simracers. I mostly play iRacing on it and it's a blast. Nothing comes close to VR even though it can get quite hot over time.
2024-02-05,Try it one handed mode. And try thrill of the fight
2024-02-27,Thank you for your service.

2024-02-19,What keyboards will feet PianoVision? I have no keyboards
2024-02-06,Yeah I'm also so confused why Bigscreen can't do passthrough. One of the oldest apps available but could really do with some updates. I don't even think it has hand tracking ffs.

Pair a bluetooth controller.

Put the xbox on standby power settings mode woth remote play enabled.

Log into the xbox app.

Set up your console for remote playe from the app if you have not done so already.

Press the remote play button and conect to the console.

Best results are if the console is ethernet conected to the wifi modem/router your quest is conected to for a 0 lag gaming experience. 

You must press the view and menu buttons of the controller (select and start depending on the type of controller) to enable full controller mode."
2024-02-06,"I've had great luck with Xbox one and gamepass on the quest2 a year and a half ago. My controller paired with no problem. I also play Call Of Duty Mobile as well.

So I knew exactly what to do."
2024-02-05,"Sorry mate. That's a path I cannot guide.

I torrented entire libraries years ago. They are now in a hard drive for such an occasion."
2024-02-06,Les Mills is pretty good.
2024-02-06,Nah les mills looks super cheesy. And it has you doing weird moves. Personally I like supernatural. It motivates me to work out with the different scene in it and the coaches. And the fact that I can listen to popular music on there is pretty amazing
2024-02-06,Low key would need one hand now when the other controller basically floats away xD think I fixed it by taping down the battery but might as well use one hand too
2024-02-06,You can add songs to beat saber? Are you talking about custom maps people made? I can’t imagine auto-generated maps being any good but I’d love to be wrong on that.
2024-02-08,I use Virtual Desktop (app on meta store) to play steam version of beat saber and it’s really smooth! i couldn’t get it to work with a link cable bc my pc is being silly so this is my work around. Hope this helps 🫶
2024-02-06,"I wouldn't say ""replaced"", but sculpting in VR is a whole different experience than using Blender or Zbrush. You can grab and stretch the object to scale it super big and you can either paint in geometry or you can carve it out. I find it easier than the traditional sculpting methods.

There's also Gravity Sketch, but I haven't really used it. It's a polygon based modeling app which looks pretty cool"
2024-02-05,"I use Immersed for work, it's really cool."
2024-02-06,"Mostly Horizon workrooms.  Has a great setup (that is pretty robust) for a private office; and the meeting interface is also super (can see your desktop in the meeting, can share it, can invite non-vr folks to join too).

Immersed is ok.  App is super buggy for me still and its a constant fight to get right and get the right thing showing; also being on a mac the desktop streaming is laggy AF.

Microsoft Mesh for joining those team calls."
2024-02-05,"If you are using Big Screen the quality is amazing! Just like watching it on a tv or pc. Crystal clear, sound is great (esp on Q3), and the way the lighting works in the environments is pretty amazing imo."
2024-02-05,Great if you have a Plex server or if you sideload movies
2024-02-05,"It uses the controller still, never tried to see if it can just use hand tracking. 

I find that hand tracking controls are still quite wonky on the Quest 3, so golfing might not be ideal due to its sensitivity."
2024-02-05,I’ve heard great things! My question is can this make me better at pickle ball?
2024-02-06,"I’m in the same boat, although I bought my keyboard yesterday and don’t have a Quest 3 yet, I started to learn the basics of reading sheet music and chords. Quest 3 will be a nice help in playing harder pieces"
2024-02-05,Nice! It's just so much more motivating to play along to songs and I can't do that on my own until I've learnt some basic beats.
2024-02-06,Does it actually help learn?
2024-02-06,Can you use any piano or does it only work with specific ones?
2024-02-06,"No, I had to do it through PCVR. It sucks because I had to buy it again but on Steam because it didn't transfer over. It didn't even show up in the Oculus PC library/store which was weird."

2024-02-06,"Yeah just try some Crisis VRigade or Pistol Whip

More intense? Thrill of The Fight"
2024-02-06,Playing VR is the same focal length as looking at something 1.5 meters away from you. It is extremely comfortable for your eyes. I’ve been VR gaming for 8 years and that idea is completely false. I have perfect vision
2024-02-06,VR doesn't mess with eyes. Only if you play for 1 hr or more your eyes start to tear and that it.
2024-02-06,"Oh yes, the custom song-feature is amazing.

2024-02-05,My wife really enjoys playing puzzling places with me.
2024-02-05,Yeah definitely worth it..the one game I'll buy the downloadable maps for straight away and are worth it. Usually five of us that play it regularly online and have a great laugh.
2024-02-05,"Absolutely worth it! I picked it up a few weeks ago and my partner and I love it.

The courses are really creative and actively encourage exploring the entire course to find hidden secrets. Controls are smooth too."
2024-02-05,"ABSOLUTELY! I play with my brother all the time. Just remember you only need the DLC on the person who starts the game, but I'd encourage you to support the development team, and also you must own the maps to collect lost balls and foxhunt rewards."
2024-02-05,It’s a great date night game!
2024-02-05,Yes 100%. One of the few I continually come back to.
2024-02-05,"Really? It looks amazing for me, im using Virtual Desktop, but im not home now to check the actual game's settings, i will do it when i get back and let you know."
2024-02-05,"Im on a 3090, 5800x3D, so basically the same setup, iRacing looks clean but yeah, its not the best looking game, try Automobilista 2, or a heavily modded AC (using pure, a ppfilter, opencomposite and opentoolkit).

But then again, iRacing on flat screen its the same, its all about the physics and not so much about the graphics (which are descent, and thats it)."
2024-03-27,"128, you basically dont use internal storage space while doing PCVR. Go for the 128gb model."
2024-02-06,"ACC is the worst in VR, the best are AMS2 by far, AC heavily modded, iRacing, in that order. ACC is just crap for me in VR, i have never been able to make it look half decent, the others look from really good to amazing (in fact i sold my triples), i love ACC but i play it way less than the others because of its abysmal vr support."
2024-02-06,"Easier (and quicker after update) modding, graphics and to avoid vendor lockin."

2024-02-05,"Oh no! Like others mentioned 11Table Tennis, Walkabout Mini gold, fitness games in general or fps like Pavlov, tarkov or contractors will get you hopefully hooked!

Since I'm playing expert levels in Beat saber it really feels like a workout :D


I think the Quest 3 hasn't released it's full potential and there is much more to come"

2024-02-10,"Yeah I'm also playing Iracing and works very well with quest 3. 
Also have motion rig så it very immersive 😊"
2024-02-05,"Yeah have done one handed mode a fair few times, but only on mere Expert. I'll have to compare heart rates for dual wielding vs fencing though.

Thrill of the Fight does look good but unfortunately atm I'm mainly after comparatively physically chilled games if it's not Beat Saber. Unfortunately my current regime leaves me a bit tired after more than an hour and it's only going to get worse.

The Light Brigade is currently my favourite game."
2024-02-05,"It depends on what streaming service you use, but i would it usually better than my 40"" TV, but not better than my 65"" Samsung Q95T.

However if you it over a glossy TV. You won't have any reflections or sun shining on your display. Also you won't need to care about the lighting in your room either."
2024-02-05,"Very good. It's basically cinema-level experience. The biggest downside for me is that the headset itself is still rather heavy and not super comfortable. Also, there's always more strain put on your eyes in VR."
2024-02-19,"To have the best experience they recommend MIDI keyboard which is able to connect to the quest via cable. I don’t have one of these though so I used my regular electronic keyboard piano and it worked good, not perfect, but good enough to follow along and play some songs. I’m a complete piano beginner so I liked how it is training my hands, especially the left, to be comfortable with the movements. I think it’s worth the price. 

I tried virtual keyboard, though and it just didn’t feel right at all, so if you have no keyboard I’d wait till getting even a cheap one. I picked mine up from OfferUp for $20."
2024-02-05,Make sure your measure your eye distance and set the dial the number (quest 3) I just turned until i thought it was clear. A few months later I decided to actually download an eye app got the right measurement set it and OMG so fucking clear and no blurryness! I scream as had to tell my wife I’ve been using to wrong this whole time

2024-02-05,"DCS is the best and my favorite, but is pretty hard core and there is a steep learning curve. VTOL VR doesn't have the steep learning curve that DCS does, and is a lot of fun. Another one that doesn't get mentioned much is IL-2 Sturmovik, and it works great in VR."
2024-02-05,"no , I probably bought it at a dollar general or roses years ago.

My point is ANY US household extension cord of sufficient length will do.

At first before my q3 was delivered I thought it would require a 3 prong plug, but 18 watts is peanuts for any wall outlet and extension cord. If it will run my 4k tv  without getting warm it damn sure will run a quest3."

2024-03-25,I use both and am a bodycombat instructor irl. I prefer supernatural but BC does give you a great workout. The moves in BC are inspired from multiple MA formats instead of just boxing. But it's mainly boxing.m since you can only do so much in VR.
2024-02-06,Oh yeah I meant custom maps on Beat Saber. Obviously a bit different on OhShape but ultimately the same outcome of having songs you enjoy.

2024-02-05,"I'd certainly think so, if only because it keeps all the same muscles and joints flowing in the same manner. It's like pickleball mixed with tennis and racquet ball so the racquet is more responsive than a pickleball one but holy F is it a fun game. If it existed as a real, standalone sport I think it would be even more popular than pickleball"
2024-02-06,"It basically cuts out half of what you need to learn because you don’t need to work on reading music at all. 

It gives you a huge boost towards playing the songs you want to play, because you can focus all your learning on finger coordination."
2024-02-06,"It will show you what notes to hit on ANY piano.

But if you have a digital piano or keyboard that plugs into the quest, the music actually pauses UNTIL you hit the right note.  Which is a super cool feature to help you progress faster.  If you connect it also gives you a score on your playing so you know if you are making micro improvements each time you play."

so don't say the idea is completely false just based on your own experience."
2024-02-07,pretty sure you get eye fatigue from it and fixing at a screen for that long is surely not that good. it's recommended to rest and relax the eyes every 30 mins but most don't do it. I don't do it myself.

2024-02-05,I bought the Q2 a few months back then promptly returned it and bought a Q3. IMHO the resolution/blur tones was like night and day between the two. Reading text on my PC was legit hard with the Q2 and quite crisp with my Q3.

2024-02-06,Some players tend to switch to monoscopic (ie. you only see one of the two images at a time) when paused and switch back to regular once you hit play again. If you experience blurring it might have to do with the lens width or the quality of the video itsefl as many older ones seem to most of the time miss their mark when it comes to proper 3D separation.

Games are also expensive because VR doesn't make as much money. I don't know the link but there is a website for game referrals. Hopefully someone links it. You can get 25% off almost any game plus look out for deals from meta like 30% off. There are also trials of some games to see if you would like it"
2024-09-22,"Thank you for such an in depth review, I was aiming to have a lot of similar use cases.  
Main things I wanted to use the quest for were:  
Office work: Generally it seems like there's enough issues regarding this, as highlighted by your post.  
Gaming: Pricing for the games is less than ideal.  
Watching content: Other devices have better lenses. 

Maybe my expectations are too high, but it isn't a gen1 product, they have already made multiple releases, so I was hoping at least the lense quality could be better and the integration for work.

I probably should see how fun I would find the gaming side of it, maybe it would be enough to keep me active and save me going to the gym and also be a bit more fun than the usual cardio I do!"

2024-11-27,The window not moving with you sucks so much I’m hoping their will be a QOL update in the future that does this (a setting that you can toggle off and on that allows the window to follow head movement seems like a good start)
2024-12-09,Thank you very much. I was extremely tempted to buy it but 300 plus shipping and tax is WAY TOO EXPENSIVE! But was dead on so close on buying it still. I think I will buy it if it ever goes down to 200. Would also probably be a huge waste if I just want it for VR Poker and nothing else.
2024-12-10,"Is it just me or are there no good apps for the Quest 3? Most games suck and Meta horizons is a pile of hot garbage. The headset is fantastic and the idea holds so much potential. How can Meta screw this up so badly.

I love VR gaming and have been using the steam headset since the pandemic. I got so much enjoyment out of Half Life Alyx, Super Hot, and Boneworks and was looking forward to other games dedicated to the Quest 3 which is a superior headset, Unfortunately the headset may be great but all the games are just lacking.

I was so excited to get onto Meta Horizons and invite friends that live across the world to come together so we could chat, share videos, play games and have a good experience. You can kind of do this in the existing worlds in Horizons but not in a nice private setting. Why use this uncomfortable platform when I can just zoom my friends instead?

Come on Meta, up your game and produce something that is actually great like Half Life Alyx and definitely something better than the playground for children in Horizons.

Watching videos is about the only thing in which it excels.

2024-10-30,"> when there are tethered headsets with much better graphics and better straps and comfort right out of the box.


But which one? If you're strictly and **only** talking about PCVR, then there's the Pimax Crystal Light. It's quite a bit more expensive though. You don't need a Powerbank if you use the Quest 3 for thethered PCVR, it should last about 5 hours that way.


But if you get the Pimax then of course you only have tethered PCVR. Nothing else. No Batman. No Beat Saber on the go.


Quest 3 is the jack of all trades. It does everything it does good or very good. If you have very specific needs then of course other headsets might fit your bill better."
2024-10-30,"I wasn’t a fan of the Quest 3 either mainly due to battery life and comfort as you said. I tried the Bobo and Globular Cluster halo straps and both felt wobbly and caused forehead pain pretty quickly due to having to tighten them so much to keep them sturdy. 

I happened to see the new Kiwi H4 boost battery halo strap on Amazon with a 50% off code last weekend (only paid $40 for it), and grabbed a 45watt power adapter as well. Now I get 3-4 hours of battery life, the headset and headstrap which has passthrough charging completely charges up in about 2 hours with a 45watt adapter, and it’s much more sturdy and comfy for me than both the Bobo and GC. It’s the first time in a year I’m happy with the headset. 

I only use the Q3 for standalone though, and still prefer the PSVR2 for PCVR due to the other things you mentioned, colors, blacks, no compression or latency, and it has much better binocular overlap, a larger FOV, and a brighter display. It obviously uses fresnel lenses, they have a small sweet spot, but less glare than any fresnels I’ve used in the past."
2024-10-30,"you're not supposed to follow groupthink and be a sheep you know that right? it's ok to not like it

I like it a lot and I forked over money after some time for the bobovr s3 pro halo strap and battery so I can use it for more hours at a time in confort

by all means you should recommend people the headset you think is better value for money and make something useful out of this blogpost

the mixed reality stuff is also huge for me as I am playing the piano in passthrough app Pianovision or doing cooking prep while there's a giant screen in my field of vision in the kitchen, it's ok if you think it's overpriced, hopefully it will get cheaper and cheaper and more people can experience VR"
2024-10-30,"Im not sure what you want.
You compare a reverb g2 with a quest 3.
You do realise that the g2 was purely made for pcvr? And that with the quest 3 you get a lot of extra features? 

Maybe your expectations are too high? Maybe not enough research?
The quest 3 does everything pretty well, where the reverb does just one thing,  but does it really well.

For me, wireless is awesome.. when i play table tennis eleven, i can jump around, and when i smash the ball and it goes just wrong,i can spin around in excitement."
2024-10-30,"I don't see how going from Quest 3 -> 3S would help with your battery life or strap comfort concerns, since the battery life is marginally better at best, and the strap is the exact same?

Most people recommend Quest 3 since it is jack of all trades, does nothing extraordinary, is just ""good enough"" for most things. Also helps that is easy to use. Perfect for all the newcomers who have no idea what they want from a headset without breaking the bank (relatively).

If you're coming from more expensive options such as the Bigscreen or Pimax Crystal series, you wouldn't go to a Quest 3 to be impressed visually."
2024-10-30,"I saw a post asking for newbie advice recently, and I suggested waiting for the next index, but was downvoted quickly. Some speculate it to be dropping soon based on increased developer file activity. 

I think there’s a body of users who want to be sold an easy to use and more casual HMD, for cheap. They expect it to be high quality enough to be popular, but they are not very interested in the practical high use fidelity like an enthusiast. I think many would be perfectly happy with the downsides you mentioned or simply don’t care enough to consider it seriously.

They don’t know about or want to set up base stations, pulley systems, or aftermarket head straps. 

But there are plenty of newbies who need to know more about the reality of VR or the downsides of the Quest 3, instead of sucking Meta’s toes absentmindedly.

Edit: the Quest 3 is an amazing headset and a marvel in technology at a great price point but it is not going to satisfy every VR user or even every newbie. Myself I’d rather hold on to my cash for the index 2 drop, maybe I’ll be a skeleton first, dunno."
2024-10-30,I've done 6 hour stints in games like aw2 using an anker 10k powerbank which didn't buzz. Sounds like you got a real dud there.
2024-10-30,"I run my Quest 3 on cheap $23 powerbanks. 2x of them allow me to play indefinitely. I don't see how you getting a crappy powerbank is the headsets fault...


Also, once counterweighted with a powerbank or aftermarket headband, the headset does not dig into your face. If it does, you have the headband set stupid tight. 


Nobody says this is a perfect headset, but it IS the best affordable ""all around"" headset right now."
2024-10-30,"Pretty much all of the standalone headsets have similar battery life. Q3S isn't going to be an improvement there.


If you're used to wired headsets, then for longer sessions just plug the Quest 3 into a wall charger with at least 22W or so, and play forever.


Getting a power bank that actually works would be fine, too. I have a 10k mah powerbank and I get about 5 hours total, which is plenty for most of my sessions."
2024-10-30,"> Here’s my biggest gripe in the Quest 3 which is the battery life

So your biggest problem is easily solved by a USB pack in your pocket? My headset is always at 100%. I never have to even think about it. I just put a USB bank in my pocket and go. The only requirement is that the USB bank be USB PD and provide more than 22watts. I use a 30watt bank with no issues at all.

> I don’t see how the pancake lenses and power consumption justify spending so much money on a standalone vr headset when there are tethered headsets with much better graphics and better straps and comfort right out of the box.

Please name a PCVR only headset that has equivalent lenses and panels for $500.

As long as you keep wanting MobileVR to be PCVR you are going to be disappointed. They are not the same thing and they never will be. If what you want is PCVR, get a PCVR headset."
2025-02-12,"Hello everyone, I'm new to Quest 3 and while I'm wow about a lot of things, this is my first VR. I also wanted it to relive moments in 360 filmed on Insta X3. Although the quality is generally good I have a big problem that I cannot solve, on a ski descent for example, a child skiing with me causes a kind of latency, ghost image, I suppose it is linked to the frequency of the quest but impossible to change it... Someone to help me. Standalone, the file is on my quest. THANKS"
2025-03-24,I am able to plug my computer to it with the HDMI Video Capture card.  It works on Quest 2 also.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3Ar-EsfTg4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3Ar-EsfTg4)
2024-10-30,"I had Crystal and Q3. 

The PCL with local dimming + tax is around 900-1000. (Without local dimming is pointless) Their software is terrible and support is bad, unless you chase people on Reddit/discord. To get a working model + make it works with the software and weird cabling is a big luck. Just read their sub on Reddit. However the Qled screen with the aspheric lenses are just... Beautiful... Really amazing experience... When/if it works. Sold it off.

Q3 is a decent visual experience, but obviously LCD screen. Nowhere compared to PCL. However you spend a lot on extras - headstrap with battery, facial interface, wifi 6e/7 router, etc. and still not comfortable. Not to mention the software issues. No application ever crashed my powerful pc, but Oculus software. 

I had 9 headsets and currently I use Pico4 original and Pico3 neo link. Latter is the best value for money headset imo. I don't use them because they are the best visual, but I have the smoothest experience with P4 and P3nl. For example P4 comfy out of the box, easy to install, etc. Never crashed my PC. Visually I don't see much/any difference between Q3 and P4, but maybe Q3 slightly sharper."
2025-02-18,"I've had nothing but trouble with mine. *Constant* software issues with the already horrible UX. 

And Batman AS is a bad game but that's far more subjective."
2024-10-30,"Though you would have the SteamVR library, quite a consolation prize!"
2024-12-13,"Also, we use lithium cobalt acid battery cells instead of ordinary 18650 battery cells, and the safety system is higher. And through the international standard UL2056."
2024-10-30,"Pancake lenses require a more powerful screen due to light loss fresnel lenses do not have that loss.

So a quest 3s should have lower power draw."
2024-10-30,"Sorry, but people have been talking about Deckard coming out soon for years. You can't keep recommending a headset that hasn't even been announced yet. Not to mention there hasn't even been any information about the supposed specs of that device."
2024-10-30,Yeah I did. And the power bank I bought had great reviews too so very disappointing
2024-10-30,Wow you had problems with quest 3 software? I never experienced that yikes
2024-10-30,You get that with a Quest 3 aswell.
2024-10-30,Then again it uses a single screen for both lenses unlike the q3 with a screen for each lens.
2024-10-30,"That is 100% true, but meaningless. We are talking moving from 90 minutes to two hours.

Just use a 30watt USB PD pack and you never have to think about battery life again."
2024-10-30,But it also has smaller battery. All in all the battery life is pretty similar.
2024-10-30,"Surely there are some people out there that feel the same way I do and just need a little nudge to do some research. I don’t agree to act like we don’t exist. It’s about full disclosure that the Deckard has not been announced, however Valve has confirmed they are still working on VR headsets. I don’t consider this kind of nuance to be unimportant."
2024-10-30,"And disconnects from wifi, which has never happened with P4. I use VD mostly."
2024-10-30,"Yes, I agree that’s on the Quest 3 as well, SteamVR support gets you a lot of games and you might be satisfied by that without the benefits of the Batman exclusive or portable Beat Saber. The Batman game looks awesome.

I don’t want to go for the Quest 3 when I know I can get a pulley system and use a summonable cable twist display.

I am trying to wait for the new index but I’m still tempted by the Pimax Crystal Light. The Bigscreen Beyond I think has lenses that are too small and so a sweet spot too small, that will give me tunnel vision. But the Pimax Crystal Light Aspheric lenses  might have blurring, which makes me hesitate."
2024-10-30,"Sure, but OP is mentioning potential powerbanks and similar."
2024-10-30,"Sure, but that info is also several years old. Deckard can come out next year, or it can come out in 5 years. There's no telling. At this point it's pretty much the same as saying people should wait for the quest 4 which is most likely coming out at the end of 2026."

To get a working model + make it works with the software and weird cabling is a big luck. Just read their sub on Reddit. However the Qled screen with the aspheric lenses are just... Beautiful... Really amazing experience... When/if it works. Sold it off.

Q3 is a decent visual experience, but obviously LCD screen. Nowhere compared to PCL. However you spend a lot on extras - headstrap with battery, facial interface, wifi 6e/7 router, etc. and still not comfortable. Not to mention the software issues. No application ever crashed my powerful pc, but Oculus software. Sold it off.

I had 9 headsets and currently I use Pico4 original and Pico3 neo link. Latter is the best value for money headset imo. I don't use them because they are the best visual, but I have the smoothest experience with P4 and P3nl. For example P4 comfy out of the box, easy to install, etc. Never crashed my PC. Visually I don't see much/any difference between Q3 and P4, but maybe Q3 slightly sharper."
2024-10-30,"And none of that makes the Q3S, with its slightly lower power draw but also smaller battery a better choice.

A 30watt USB PD bank will keep the Q3 at 100%. Moving to the Q3S will do nothing but give you a worse experience."
2024-10-30,"I agree with you, it’s not an easy or good sell, but nothing in VR really is. All of the HMDs have some kind of serious drawback. however Valve have proven they release when it’s ready and not before. For its time the index was so well rounded for long sessions and in some ways still holds up better in practice in some areas than many competitors. I think they will do it again, and I think their cadence will be about 5-7 years.

Unfortunately, I’m not in a position to purchase a headset, only for the Deckard to release a year or 6 months later. My next year of disposable income is already budgeted and I can only pull the trigger once."
2024-10-30,"Your comment is the kind of paydirt that makes me glad for standing up for my controversial opinion. Appreciate you and your experience/expertise🙂.

I’ll focus on the PCL for a few paragraphs. I heard that its software has been improved.

But living in Australia I am be concerned about having to RMA for repair or replacement. It’s good to know they aren’t likely to ignore me forever if I need help, getting there in the end is what ultimately matters.

Does the IPD adjuster have good build quality and stay in place when not touched, or perhaps even bumped a little? I’m thinking the right aftermarket strap and a modicum of care turning my head will prevent it shifting on my face and the headset going blurry/needing IPD re-adjustment and reseating on the face.

I have the impression that Aspheric lenses if they’re kept in the right position are the very best.

It’s probably my best option but I will lose an arm and a leg financially because though my R9 5950x is up to snuff, my poor little RTX3060 just won’t be enough for those screens in the PCL. Without a Saudi oil money backer I’m gonna have to sell something!

Now the Q3. I think it would do fine but the lack of QLED and introduction of pancake lenses, superior though they may be, will result in just quite not enough colour/blacks and brightness for the hours of commitment I’m looking at. I’d be paying for and holding up all the integrated hardware to support standalone, which I would only like for showing my wife or friends. Most of the time those chips and battery will be wasted space. Not to mention Meta would happily wall me off from other ecosystems if they could get away with it. Future mods will be few and far between - it is a devil’s deal. It’s still considerably great value and I don’t think many or maybe any at Meta or Zuck hold ill will, at all. I believe they genuinely care about making a great product but is just a fact of big business about collateral damage. Look at Luckey Palmer.

The Pico 4 and Pico 3nl I have not heard much about, I saw them and briefly heard some review from VoodooDE about the Picos. I’m pretty sure he gave them glowing reviews. I remember something  about compatibility issues but I really need to rewatch and take a closer look at those in general.

Thanks for your help and input."
2024-10-30,"You're welcome, I like honest reviews and opinions, based on experience rather than fan based over excitement. :)

I had the Crystal OG, not the PCL, so I can't comment on the manual IPD adjustment. But a headstrap is a must as even the light is heavy. An Apache like headstrap would do, it made my PCOG nicely balanced. Or if you don't want to spend money on it, you can make one for yourself. 

I initially had a 4060ti with PCOG, it was nice, but not good enough. Later I upgraded to a 3070tis, that made a difference in a good way. Still I couldn't max it out in alk the games. 

Yeah, I agree with your comment on Meta ecosystem. It looks great on paper, but holds back VR development to the phone game level, as Q3 is essentially a phone. Plus for me Meta's acciunt management practice is... Hmmm. Questionable..."
2024-11-02,I bought mine mine a few days ago and honestly it is the coolest thing I've ever had the pleasure to own. I still can't believe how far VR has come and I'm excited about the future in this space.
2024-11-02,"It worth it. I bought the Meta Qu’est 3s before the 3 to see if it was really good (always test it yourself). Well the 3 is coming on Monday. It’s great, really. And if you want to buy something with it, I recommend another head strap with an external battery, it will only be more comfortable."
2024-11-03,Any idea about black friday deals for Q3?
2024-11-02,"what do you want to use it for? first i would buy a headstrap either elite one with battery or halo one with battery if you know your going to play more then 4 hours at a time. 

is it worth it ? yes i have 2 q3 and 1 q2 . i got the second q3 because i was not wanting to wait for lens inserts so I scratched them playing action games. 

Get lens inserts to protect the screen even if you don't wear glasses"
2024-11-02,"It’s a great time to get into VR. there’s a ton of games and experiences to be had. You have to decide if it’s worth it to you personally but 99% of people will tell you it’s been worth it to them. As for accessories, two are needed. A battery head strap. Bobo s3 and m3 pro are the most popular. They will run $40-80.  If you wear glasses. Get prescription inserts for $50."
2024-11-02,"I bought one a week ago. Hadn't used VR since psvr 1 (which I didn't use much).... MQ3 iLove tho. I feel it's finally reached a place where it goes beyond gaming. I watch 4k YouTube /yt TV, browse reddit, the internet and more. All at the same time if I want. My wife watches a show and I can still watch it w pass thru while doing that stuff. I was texting via WhatsApp while multitasking last night. All very cool stuff I'll continue to do. I've only played two games and they were incredible, but the replay value for me is in the multimedia. Watched most of an NBA game last night and felt like I was in a theater. Incredible..... Sorry all over the place but thoughts just kept coming"
2024-11-03,"What bad reviews? Lmao, the quest 3 is awesome. Don't cheap put and buy the 3s, you won't be as happy."
2024-11-03,Upgraded from a Valve Index I've had since 2020. Lenses big upgrade. Sound slightly worse but adequate. Headstrap is absolute booty but replaceable for 20 bucks. Tracking is just as good if not better. Pass through is miles better. It was half the price of my Index. It's a great bang for the buck. If Valve ever releases an Index 2 I'll probably buy it but right now the Quest 3 is doing great. I mostly play sim racing and Skyrim via link cable.
2024-11-03,"Its amazing, also get a bobovr :p passthrough apps and games are a huge blast"
2024-11-03,Best thing I ever bought serious!
2024-11-04,If you wear glasses. I'd recommend getting the prescription lenses that you can fit inside the headset. Makes for a much better and more comfortable experience
2024-11-05,"I was unsure, kept getting close to buying one then backing out. Eventually I pulled the trigger and I'm so glad I did. I'd pay £150 even if it was just a standalone beat saber device I'm having that much fun with it.

I tried the Batman Arkham shadow game last night and as someone that has never played VR, it was unlike anything I've ever experienced.

Not to mention the other things you can do with the headset. Watch Netflix and YouTube etc, set up virtual screens. 

The only issue for me is that I want more. I need to upgrade my PC so I can play PCVR. I really want one of those treadmill things so I can move by walking/running as opposed to moving a stick."
2024-11-02,"If this is your first headset, I recommend the 3s. Half the price, the lenses aren't that big of a deal to me personally the 3s looks fine , lots of games available"
2024-11-02,"I was unsure but absolutely sold now , highly recommend the bobovr s3 though"
2024-11-02,Buy one and take it back if you don't like it. Meta's been promoting its return policy on its site because you can't demo them in the stores. Most return policies should allow enough time to know if it's right for you at the moment.
2024-11-02,It's so worth it. I was on the fence like you
2024-11-02,"Take advantage of the Meta 3 with the 512GB Storage for $500 right now! I'm pretty sure you get Batman, Meta Plus subscription for 3 months AND another 30$ (of regular game) amount for ANY game you want. As someone with the PSVR2, I ONLY WISH I had more storage, FOR BOTH! 

GET into the radius and into bkack, arizona sunshine remake, sooooo many GREAT games available right now!"
2024-11-02,"Totally worth it. Great deal. Great bundled game. Buy an after market strap.

Only you can know if VR is for you…. And to know you might have to try it!"
2024-11-03,"It's a fantastic purchase. Until you stick the headset on and experience it for yourself, no words can describe it. With the right games and apps it's a beast. I feel like I spend more time socialising on the headset in bigscreen vr then I do in real-life outside of work

Streaming from my ps5 is brilliant as well along with virtual desktop for hosting live streams or steam vr games

Definitely worth investing in a better head strap like the bobovr and an extra battery pack or two."
2024-11-03,Quest 3 is awesome
2024-11-03,I'm brand new to the VR world and last week I bought the Quest 3. My mind is blown as how cool it is. I got it for the batman game (which I still havent played lol). I mostly have been exploring the Meta Horizon Worlds and interacting with other players. I'm loving it!
2024-11-02,Thanks a lot. I am going to get the external battery but at Christmas when I hopefully get some extra money then and I’ve saved more
2024-11-02,"I’m going to use it for gaming, I can keep it plugged in while playing right? Or is that a big no?"
2024-11-03,Would you recommend the 128GB Quest 3 instead of the S3?
2024-11-04,I saw on Reddit posts and various sites and YouTube videos where people gave their views
2024-11-02,It's not just the lenses but you also get a much higher resolution with the Quest 3 over the 3S.  I didn't think I cared about the difference until I got the Quest 3 and now the difference is huge to me.
2024-11-03,"Please don't say things that aren't true...it is a big deal, pancake lenses are so much better than fresnel"
2024-11-02,What is it? And why do you recommend it?
2024-11-02,What’s the another 30$ of a regular game about? I didn’t hear anything about that
2024-11-02,After market strap?
2024-11-03,Referral Codes - Discussions related to referral codes are not allowed in this SubReddit. Thank you!
2024-11-02,I’m keeping my fingers crossed for you 🤞🏽 it’s worth it ✊
2024-11-02,"You can play plugged in. when I do long sessions I recommend getting a power block that's got fast charging.

Long run it's even better to go with a battery head strap at well. You can see a big difference in fighting games"
2024-11-02,"You can keep it plugged in but it will still drain the battery, just at a slower rate."
2024-11-03,If you can find one for sure .
2024-11-04,Youtube videos give bad reviews for clicks a lot of times. The quest 3 is awesome.
2024-11-03,"Can you read, or do you just like posting? ""To me personally"" is an opinion. For $300 , on presumably the first headset they will own, without knowing age or engagement level, the 3s is a good option."
2024-11-03,"The strap the meta quest 3 has is dog ass and the battery life sucks. A bobovr is 3rd party strap that is super comfortable and comes with a battery that charges while you play, adding an extra 2-3 hours of game time. Well worth it."
2024-11-03,"It’s the head strap with extra battery and cooling face fan . The og strap if rubbish to be honest , I got the strap and it’s a game changer"
2024-11-02,Yeah the stock strap on pretty much on every quest the minimum - it’s the place they cut costs and upsell to premium straps - it’s the dump stat of Meta hardware
2024-11-02,That’s good that you can. I’ll have to get a charging block. What do you mean there’s a big difference with the battery head strap on?
2024-11-02,What power block would you suggest?
2024-11-03,Yeah there are some available by me I just wondered if with it being discontinued there would be issues
2024-11-03,So you lie to yourself :p
2024-11-03,"Yeah the standard Quest 3 strap is designed to make you need to upgrade, Meta assume to their crappy overpriced one.

The Bobovr S3 Pro is light  years better, comfortable, awesome battery life, even got a cooling fan!"
2024-11-02,i have a anker brand power bank and brick that works for me.  i also use the bobovr 3s pro for portable
2024-11-02,"You want a high quality (usually brand-name, I like Anker) USB C charger that does PD (power delivery) with 18W or higher capacity."
2024-11-03,No it's still going to be supported they're just not selling new 128 since the 512 is the standard now.
2024-11-03,Ooh nice I’ll have to get one
2024-11-03,"Oops, sorry!"
2024-11-02,Ok cool thanks. Do you suggest anything that I can plug into my wall? My anchors have spots to plug wires straight into but can I just get something to connect that to the headset? What would you suggest for that?
2024-11-03,Thanks
2024-11-03,What was it you sent?
2024-11-02,"I usually play seated with mine connected to a power strip under my chair. I use a 10"" usbc to usbc cable rated for power delivery. I'm sure that are plenty of options, but I've had good luck with the right angle ones by Fasgear."
