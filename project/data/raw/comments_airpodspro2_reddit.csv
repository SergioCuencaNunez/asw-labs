2024-11-20,"No, I‚Äôm skipping because this is legitimately the longest post I have ever seen on reddit. You put to shame every teenager who writes a book on their relationship problems."
2024-11-20,Any chance you can expand on your thoughts üòí
2025-02-05,"A bit long lol but anyway, thanks to this post, I got the AirPods Pro 2 they are much better from the 1 generation. Any suggestions for a leather case?"
2024-11-20,I would love to read these but it's just too long man. Maybe try paraphrasing each paragraph? Would love to read these if it were shorter.
2024-11-20,"I love that in spite of the extensive knowledge and experience offered in this post, I will see at least 5 more posts tomorrow of ""Are the Airpods Pro 2 worth it?"""
2024-11-20,"Nice review. Not sure why you're getting cooked for it being long. Would rather a review be detailed than it be just a set of bullet points with no elaboration. Was able to get through *most* of it without skipping to the bottom, though I did skip some of the later sections comparing the APP2 with the APP1 and the AP4 since I already own the APP2. I generally agree with you on most points with a few differences in opinion that mostly come down to personal preference. Only nitpick would be your equating larger headphone driver size with better sound quality since it's not quite as simple as that, but otherwise, good looks üëç"
2024-11-20,"i have been rocking them since there release however I have always had terrible experience with the microphone, sound quality is good for ear buds for sure but nothing out of the world, a 60$ noise cancelling over the ear headphone easily outperforms airpods, but can not give you the portability and the apple experience."
2024-11-20,"I dont mind this being long, clearly you enjoyed doing it more people need to just do things they find joy in and pass on it if they don't rather than dragging others down for doing it in the first place."
2024-11-20,"Though seeing the post I thought it‚Äôs too long to read, when I started reading it was flowing. I could also see which portions I can skip. Good writing. Thanks for the review. I got a pair of AirPods Pro C version from my company. I have to set it up."
2024-11-20,"I appreciate how much detail you went into, as someone deciding whether to buy APP2 when they go on sale to upgrade from the OGs. Yes, it is a long post... I didn't have time to read it, so I chose to have Siri read it to me -- id rather have all the info from someone who has used all the options for a long time that what most reveiws are... ""I just got these today, they seem amazing so far!"" LOL"
2024-11-21,My English teacher is hounding me for the annotations on this puppy. due Friday
2024-11-21,"People hating on the best, most thorough review   I've seen on AirPods Pro gen 2s is so stupid. If you want a review, you should want one with all the details you can fit in it. I know that half the people hating are very unsatisfied with their other purchases due to the fact they can't read a review cuz it's ""too long""."
2024-11-22,Nice review. I‚Äôm a new Air Pod user and mainly bought them as a hearing aid. After many years in a manufacturing environment my ability to hear high soft voices is frustrating. I also listen to music and have several blue tooth over the ear sets. The initial hearing test was a bust for me as it kept getting an error message in the end saying that the noise in the room was too loud. That wasn‚Äôt the problem and after reading on Apples forum it a big problem. I was able to use an App called Mimi and upload those results after an hour of hearing tests. I really like them and use them for everything from watching tv to any important conversations. They are a game changer for the money to me.
2024-11-20,Is this writing prompts?
2024-11-20,Do you expect anybody to read your dribble of a review
2024-11-20,Please elaborate on your points
2024-11-21,"motherfucker made an entire fucking essay for a pair of airpods jfc

thank god for that summary but‚Ä¶

GOOD MICROPHONE???? this sentence alone made your entire 10k word essay invalid. This is a very bad lie and there‚Äôs no way in heck you have any idea of how a mic should actually sound like"

2024-11-22,"Welp, that's probably around 5-10 minutes of Youtube video in writing.

I just have a question though, your battery life is 4-4.5 hours after 2 years of daily usage or that's what you got when it's brand new?"
2024-11-30,"Nice review and a good read. By some of the comments, it does amuse me how lazy people have gotten and expect everything to pushed into their eyeballs by some crappy TikTok video."
2024-12-26,this review has convinced me to pull the trigger and buy the APP 2‚Äôs. Thank you for taking your time and adding much needed details and personal experience with the product in question
2025-01-12,Thanks mate for this review‚Ä¶ I found a good deal of new airpods pro 2 with lightning for 150 euro and i was hesitant buying them due to the lightning. Seeing your post though changed my mind. Thanks
2025-03-16,Thank you for the comprehensive post. It was well written and nmot too long as it covers all aspects in detail and was very easy to read.
2024-11-20,"Great review. Idk why people are beating you up about how long the post is‚Ä¶
Wouldn‚Äôt you guys want a more in depth review? If you don‚Äôt have the time to read it that‚Äôs your problem, not OPs"
2024-11-20,Great well flushed out review! Willing to bet half the people commenting wouldn‚Äôt have an issue if there was some subway surfers at the bottom and an AI voice narrating it lol
2024-11-20,Going to have to Apple AI summary that
2024-11-20,"I tried apple airpod 2 after having beat fit pro and swear I couldn‚Äôt tell a sound quality difference,"
2024-11-20,"I bought these for video meetings but they neither work with Microsoft Teams, or Google Meet - known issue that Apple doesn't care to worry about."
2024-11-20,I‚Äòve seen other posts and noticed myself that the ANC has gotten worse maybe because of the hearing health updat? Did you notice the same thinng or is it just getting used to it?
2024-11-20,I‚Äòve seen other posts and noticed myself that ANC has gotten worse. Is it because of the hearing health update or just getting used to it?
2024-11-20,"Anyone has had problems with ANC?

Like i had blood dripping from my ears and it happened two times i read ANC it‚Äôs not safe to continuous use and i never had this problems until i bought my APP2 :(

Just ended never using ANC anymore"
2024-11-20,"Good review but I recently tried the APP2, and personally was not a fan with the sound, it was too neutral for my liking"
2024-11-20,They suck. Mine only lasted 2 years before being fried from using. Apple Store said there‚Äôs nothing they can do but I can drop 300 for a new pair. Fuck these.
2024-11-20,"I returned my AirPods Pro gen 2, sound quality was awful on them so idk if I got a bunk pair or not but they sounded so nasally and the bass was barely there. My xm4 earbuds are still superior"
2024-11-20,Nobody:  The Original AirPods are so comfortable
2024-11-20,This is so long it exceeds the context window of ChatGPT bro
2024-11-21,Skipped post and came straight here for the comments.
2024-11-21,"My long term review:



Sounds good. 1 and half years in the right side stopped working. Classic Apple move, 6/10"
2024-11-21,Mucho texto
2024-11-21,Someone lmk what happened to his case cuz ain‚Äôt nobody reading that post üòÇ
2024-11-22,Don‚Äôt know why so many people are ragging on an in-depth review‚Ä¶
2024-11-22,"I would want a review this long for a car maybe.

I ain‚Äôt reading all that for a pair of headphones ü§£"
2024-11-22,Yeah whatever just put the fries in the bag bro
2024-11-22,"crazy replies, thanks for this post. ill get a pair this black friday"
2024-11-22,What happened to the case? Looks melted
2024-11-22,"I've been using them for a couple months, they seem to be more reliable than jabra, sony or bose breakage wise in reviews with second best anc after bose, bose qc fails to even pair correctly, but inferior battery life to sony and not water resistant like jabra. I also got that terrible right bud buzzing bug a few times which is so unacceptable on a new product. Sometimes they won't even fix or replace your product if it has this. I have applecare and it's gone away so well see I guess. Like any bud besides sony I have to listen on like 35 percent volume with ANC enabled to get 4-5 hr battery life. I use them with android and works fine so far . They really need to aim for a higher water resistance as well

Can I turn on this loud sound reduction for better performance in full ANC mode? Any way to do in on android, or do it on an iPhone and keep it set that way on android"
2024-11-23,"I was having buyers remorse from purchasing them from Amazon because I already have the AirPod pros, but this post made me excited for them.

I‚Äôve had my AirPod pros since 2021 and I have definitely noticed battery degradation. The left pod also makes an odd sound unless I use both pods at the same time. That left pod also makes a weird sound to whoever I‚Äôm on the phone with, so I‚Äôm basically forced to only ever use the right pod.

I also had been looking into beats or sonys for my new headphones and was a bit sad I wouldn‚Äôt be trying something ‚Äúnew‚Äù but that feeling is also gone because I love my AirPods. This post made me excited to receive a brand new, upgraded pair of my favorite headphones.

Thanks for this write up, my buyers remorse has disappeared."
2024-11-23,Congrats on finishing your dissertation bro
2024-11-24,Shit even chat gpt malfunctioned when I asked it to summarize this saying it‚Äôs too long
2024-11-24,‚ÄúI have come to believe that AirPods cases are largely a mistake. They just make them more bulky and don‚Äôt do that much to protect them.‚Äù - I gave up reading at this point‚Ä¶
2024-11-24,"This weird thing about attention is really off putting. This is much longer than it needs to be and people are not interested in wasting their time listening to you wax poetics, get over yourself lmao. Gtfo here with that weird postering shit bro"
2024-11-24,"I have the AirPods first gen and second gen and I love it! Last year I found a brand new AirPods Pro 2, like 7 days since actived. I tried to reach out the owner but he was from another country and told me I could keep it since would be too much work to shipping and stuffs ( he might be some rich üòÖ). So now I‚Äôm using it and it‚Äôs pretty amazing. The noise cancellation it‚Äôs just amazing! To travelers it‚Äôs perfect! I could finally sleep in an airplane flight!"
2024-11-25,Good review bro
2024-11-27,"""Obviously, a pair of over-ear headphones like AirPods Max will have better sound quality and bass due to having much larger drivers, but for the size of the earbud, they‚Äôre super impressive.""  
I actually disagree. I \*am\* one of those audio people, and the airpods pro 2 sound multiple times better than the airpods max in my opinion. it's that much better. Seriously, these things sound amazing."
2024-11-28,Can anyone comment on their experience Airpods Pro 2nd Gen. vs. Airpods Pro 2
2024-11-29,this a video script not a Reddit post
2024-12-03,"Thanks for the review and your thoughts. They fit my ears well (which was not true with Airpod Pros 1, which fell out), and the sound and noise reduction greatly improved."
2024-12-04,i aint readin allatüò≠üôè
2024-12-05,"Even chatGPT could not summarise this. Thank you for the very long, detailed review"
2024-12-20,"At first glance, I didn‚Äôt want to read all of this. After all the hate comments, I decided to give this post a shot anyway. It was thorough, well written (as a review should be) and offered short summaries for those of you with learning issues. Well done and I found the information I needed!"
2024-12-22,Can you elaborate some more please ü§£
2024-12-22,"I read the whole review and like the comparisons with the airpods 4 and pros 2 as im in the market at the moment and was undecided. Coming from the AirPods 2, any of these two is an improvement. Thank you! Im gonna try to pros 2 as they are on sale at the moment."
2024-12-29,Very detailed thank you - just trying decide if I buy in man or wait 8 months now as I suspect the next will be out in September 2024
2025-01-01,"They're a waste of money. I bought $30 ear buds that do 100% what these do. They even provide more noise canceling. I took my new airpods out three or four times today because outside noise was bothering me. The price of this subpar product is exactly whi I avoid Apple like the plague. Only reason I bought them is my sister bought me a $15 case I loved that only fit them. Only good thing I can say, Apple is finally using the same charger port everything else is. In summary, if you enjoy your own farts and music on vinyl, this product is for you. If you actually work hard for your money and watch your budget, there are far better options."
2025-01-08,Have you had any issue with crackling sounds in noise cancellation mode?  That‚Äôs my main reason for wanting to upgrade.
2025-01-15,I read every single bit of your review and thoroughly appreciate the effort. I currently use Heavys H1H headphones and they‚Äôre the best I‚Äôve ever had. But they suck to travel with which is why I‚Äôm considering APP2. This was super helpful.
2025-01-20,Holy fuck even skipping over that took awhile.. I‚Äôm just gonna buy em lol
2025-01-22,Can you make this any fucking longer???
2025-01-26,just picked some up for $50. theyre pretty good.
2025-01-31,"Nice writeup. I just bought pro 2 and wanted to read someone‚Äôs experience, this fit the bill perfectly. Thanks."
2025-02-01,"So many people are hating on how long it is, and sure it‚Äôs long, but you‚Äôre getting overhated man. I read the whole thing and I know my exact thoughts on these airpods now lmao."
2025-02-12,"Thank you so much for the review.  I have the Shokz conduction set of headphones, and while they do a pretty good job when they work, they are inconsistent in connecting, and I am considering the Airpods Pro 2."
2025-02-13,I just bought my first air pods today at Costco for $180. I don't know if this is a good price as I never bought air pods before. I read 90% of your post and I think I made the right choice as you seem happy. Costco also had the regular 3rd gen there for $149. I will attempt to connect them to the phone now as I think the case is fully charged which I don't know but I had it plugged in to the charger for 2-3 hours. a red light blinks when i move the case but never see green. Maybe there is no green. Anyway thanks for your review.

2025-02-14,"Excellent review!  Mahalo nui!  And no, your review wasn‚Äôt too long, I appreciate your thoroughness. I have been using Sony WF-C700N earbuds for two years now. They‚Äôve done well, but they just lost the microphone function. I am considering buying AirPods Pro 2 or Bose QuietComfort. Any opinions on this choice are appreciated."
2025-02-18,"Here you go guys:

AirPods Pro 2: Two-Year Review Gist
Overall: The author is very satisfied with the AirPods Pro 2 after two years of daily use, citing excellent sound quality, impressive noise cancellation, and convenient features.  While there are some minor design flaws, they are overshadowed by the pros.
Key Points:
 * Design: Comfortable fit, durable buds, but the case scratches easily and the charging pins are finicky.  Case design could be improved to prevent AirPods from flying out when dropped.
 * Sound:  Excellent sound quality for the size, good microphone quality.  Personalized Spatial Audio is a plus, but Conversation Awareness and Personalized Volume are less useful. No built-in EQ.
 * ANC/Transparency: ANC is highly effective, even rivaling some over-ear headphones. Transparency mode is good but not as natural as removing the earbuds. Adaptive Audio is less useful than either.
 * Battery: Battery life is satisfactory, with quick charging. Degradation is noticeable after two years.
 * iOS 18:  Hearing health features (hearing test, hearing aid functionality, hearing protection) are revolutionary. Siri Interactions are less useful.  Spatial Audio for gaming and improved voice isolation are welcome additions.
 * Upgrades:  Upgrading from older AirPods or first-gen AirPods Pro is recommended if battery is degraded or new features are desired. Upgrading from Pro 2 with Lightning to USB-C is generally not worth it (unless you have specific connectivity issues with the Lightning version and use a Vision Pro).
 * AirPods 4: The author strongly recommends AirPods Pro 2 over AirPods 4 due to significantly better noise cancellation and the lack of volume controls on the AirPods 4. The open-ear design of the AirPods 4 results in significant sound leakage and inferior ANC.
TLDR (Apple Intelligence Summary):
The AirPods Pro 2 offer a comfortable design, impressive sound quality, and highly effective noise cancellation.  While the case has some minor issues, the overall experience is excellent.  Upgrading is recommended for users of older AirPods or first-gen AirPods Pro.  The new hearing health features in iOS 18 are a major selling point.  Avoid the AirPods 4 in favor of the Pro 2 unless the in-ear fit is absolutely unbearable.  Upgrading to the USB-C version of the Pro 2 is generally unnecessary."
2025-02-20,"From my experience they are not good at all,You can‚Äôt use Siri and connectivity issues. As of now one of my airpods refuse to connect because I have to update them but its been hours since then and they still don‚Äôt work..i never had a problem with the other airpods pro."
2025-02-25,"Thanks for the detail, I'm considering buying these refurbished when they go down in price"
2025-02-25,"OMG - Are you one of the last remaining humans that can think longer than a Tik Tok or Instagram post? Be very careful, soon you be hunted for having your own, very detailed thoughts. Chemical kosh coming for you!

How dare you write an actual review with comments that may be genuinely useful for someone who is thinking of buying them.

Next time can you please use chat gpt to create something and then ask it to then reduce it to 8 words and post it?"
2025-02-27,I really appreciate the post! Helped me a lotüòÅ
2025-02-28,"I have an unrelated question. How do you return used AirPods, after having opened the packaging and sealing etc? Serious question. I've been wanting to try on some AirPods prior to investing in them, but no stores offer that."
2025-02-28,Recently just got my APP1‚Äôs stolen after having them for 3 years and this convinced me to get the upgrade next month for my birthday. Thanks! Also I don‚Äôt understand the people who are saying the review is long. I think you summed up the points perfectly and I was able to skim through some of your explanations without missing much.
2025-03-01,Do not buy these POS! Not worth a penny of what they charge.
2025-03-04,"hi, i read through the sound quality and i couldn‚Äôt find if you said anything about sound leaks so just wondering if there were any sound leaks when you have it at a moderately high volume"
2025-03-05,"Im having so much connectivity issue with mine, so just using my airpod pro 1 again."
2025-03-13,mine got ran over by a truck and lost in the snow for 2 months and they work and charge the same
2025-03-13,Thank you for the in-depth post:) What I needed
2025-03-14,"man had a great time reading the review and you have convinced me thoroughly, just wondering about two things; can people hear my music if I have it blasted all the way up and will they pop out if im excercising, say playing basketball. thanks"
2025-03-25,"I bought these AirPods maybe a month ago‚Ä¶ my only complaint is when I am on the phone with the AirPods in, I can almost hear myself? Like it‚Äôs like I can hear myself on the other end of the person I‚Äôm talking to‚Ä¶ almost like an echo‚Ä¶? I don‚Äôt know how to describe it but it is SO irritating. I never noticed this with any previous AirPods I owned. I know these AirPods have a setting where when you‚Äôre talking, the music can turn down so you can have a conversation with the AirPods in, but I have this feature turned off. Is anyone else experiencing this? And if so, is there a setting that can be turned off because I currently DESPISE having any phone call with these AirPods in"
2025-03-26,"Look. I had a big concern of whether to upgrade to the AirPods Pro 2 or the AirPods 4 having owned the AirPods Pro 1 for a long time. The AirPods Pro 1 are a very good AirPods but my seller asked me to just test the AirPods Pro 2s and if I did not like then I could return. We did a bet. 

Results: The transparency mode on the AirPods Pro 2 is miles‚Ä¶.miles ‚Ä¶..miles better than the AirPods Pro 1s. For get noise cancelation. These AirPods Pro 2 sit on my ears like I am wearing nothing. 

Another thing. When I was wearing the AirPods Pro 1 with the transparency set in accommodation mode I would bang the car door and want to remove the AirPods. The bang was so loud because of the sensitivity. The AirPods Pro 2s removes that completely.

Finally the hissing that came with transparency is gone.

In short. AirPods Pro 2s are far ‚Ä¶.far better than the AirPods Pro 1s. 

As for the AirPods 4s what I hear is the noise cancellation is not as good as the AirPods Pro 2s. Of course this is the case because they have no proper seal the the ANC algorithm keeps having to work hard to compensate."
2024-11-20,"Jesus, take a breath m8."
2024-11-20,Uhm why
2024-11-20,"I asked ChatGPT to summarize your post and it says ‚Äúit‚Äôs too long, submit something shorter‚Äù"
2024-11-20,Brother post a TLDR. Ain‚Äôt nobody all that.
2024-11-20,I will get in 2 weeks airpods pro 2 type c (lightning is unavilable and i would still get typce c)
2024-11-20,AirPod 4 is better.
2024-11-20,they lwky suck if i‚Äôm being realistic right now
2024-11-20,My exact thoughts even the TLDR is too long
2024-11-20,I hate the fact that I am compelled to make a post that I hate the fact that someone has enough time to write something this long.
2025-01-19,made me self-conscious about my attention span for a second.
2025-02-20,lol redditors are so whiny
2024-11-20,"Yes, check out my profile for the rest of my in depth reviews. But I forgot you people need everything spoon-fed to you in a way that doesn‚Äôt make you do any work whatsoever"
2025-02-17,Are they comfortable for long usage? Say binging a show or listening to music for a long time while studying. Cause I find the pris comfy but when I wear them for a long time my ears start sweating a bit.
2025-02-21,Maybe too late but I bought the nomad leather case at Best Buy like 4 years ago and they aged great
2024-11-21,Past it in chat gpt and ask for the main take away. Or apple intelligence
2025-01-25,have ya'll ever heard of skimming?
2024-12-26,Why would you admit that?
2025-01-07,"TLDR good ANC, Spatial Audio, voice isolation, and sound. Also reliable, good battery and uses USB-C."

2024-11-27,really? that's interesting considering they measure really well. better than pretty much any wireless over-ear ever.
2024-11-20,"Nope, I did use the proofread feature to correct grammar and mistypes. That‚Äôs it though"
2024-11-21,Thank you Garglyballs69 for your productive and insightful comments
2024-11-22,My experience it's like that brand new listening at only 35 percent volume with anc enabled. Sony supposedly gets better life but they have round tips and seem to break more.
2024-12-01,Thank you. Good to know there are still people who are able to read more than a sentence. I‚Äôll make sure next time to upload it in video form with AI reading it over subway surfers
2024-12-26,Thank you for the kind words! So glad it was helpful! Enjoy your AirPods Pro!
2025-01-12,Glad to hear it! I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll love them! And with wireless charging it basically makes the lightning port irrelevant!
2025-03-17,Thanks for reading! Glad it‚Äôs still helping people even months later
2024-11-20,"Thank you lol, I forgot many people are incapable of reading anything longer than a sentence these days"
2024-11-20,"Not to mention, they have the ability to just stop reading and move on. Instead, they spend the time they could have used to read the post or move on to other things to point out that the review was ""too long"" for them.

I personally enjoyed the in-depth review as I was really on the fence about upgrading from the APP1 to APP2."
2024-11-21,"Agreed, it‚Äôs definitely helped me make up my mind about my next purchase! Thanks OP"
2024-11-20,Exactly lol üòÇor if I made a YouTube video instead
2024-11-21,I feel like you stole this from TikTok about a woman doing just that for her husband because her text was too long
2024-11-20,If you read the very first sentence then you‚Äôd know that I offer exactly that at the end

2024-11-21,My firm just updated our laptops and now my AirPod pro 2s always connect! They did not on my old one. I started a thread about it a few years ago on Apples site.

2024-11-24,‚Äú I gave up reading the moment someone said something I disagreed with‚Äù
2024-11-24,"If you don‚Äôt want a detailed review, that‚Äôs fine. Just say you want things spoonfed to you in a way that doesn‚Äôt require any effort or reading comprehension on your part. This whole thread is wild because it just proves most of you haven‚Äôt read a book in years, which is crazyüòÇ"
2024-12-29,"Buy now. They‚Äôre great, and waiting 8 months in hopes of new ones when they aren‚Äôt definitely coming out is ill advised in my opinion"
2025-01-08,"I had that issue on the first gen pros but not on the second, lightning or usbc"
2025-01-22,Can you make a more unnecessary comment???
2025-02-13,"It depends what you want. The AirPods Pro work great as a convenient option to bring with you everywhere and the noise cancellation is very impressive. Now for long flights or when you want an over the ear fit, then over your headphones, like the XM4s might be a good option. But at that point it‚Äôs really up to personal preference in terms of which over ear headphones you prefer. I really like the Bose 700 series headphones, and I know so nice just came out with a pair of headphones that have gotten good reviews. The only ones I wouldn‚Äôt recommend are the AirPods Max because they haven‚Äôt actually been updated in over five years, are way overpriced, and I really just worst in most ways compared to other options. Hope that helps."

2024-11-20,Thank you!

2024-11-20,Great choice! I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll love them!

2025-01-19,Holy shit it's my cake day
2024-11-20,Bruh no one wants to read a book of a review on AirPods
2024-11-20,You‚Äôre on the wrong app my guy ü§£üò≠
2024-11-21,Substack is that way üëâüèª
2024-12-02,"personally love your review man, great information and personal experience that might not be useful to everyone but i still enjoyed reading, sorry for the brain rotted commenters lol"
2025-03-11,"Right bro. You did a great job on the review and idc what any of these bums have to say YOU DID A VERY GOOD JOB THIS. Ima buy these today. Also you‚Äôre right. These smoothed brain, barely formed amoeba want to be spoon fed and never put work in for anything."
2024-11-21,You sound like youre on too high of a dose of adderall
2024-11-21,says the guy that used Apple Intelligence to summarize his dissertation of a post lol.
2025-01-05,"A bit late to that post‚Ä¶ but let me first say thank you for the in-depth review based on your experience. Not sure why you were downvoted‚Ä¶. People, if you can‚Äôt spend 10 minutes reading something.. than the problem is you, not the person who wrote it‚Ä¶ especially when you‚Äôre clicking on a topic that‚Ä¶ supposedly interests you."
2025-03-04,"Okay I know this is all very old, but I just need to say‚Ä¶. No fucking shot people are roasting you for writing up an extremely detailed and comprehensive review of headphones that cost $250?! Like I mean if this review was for like $15 Walmart headphones then maybe I could get on board with saying like‚Ä¶. Hey bro, it‚Äôs not that serious. But this is not an insignificant purchase for many people, and having someone with extensive real world experience with a product laying out pros and cons and giving some insight as to if it may be the right purchase for you on not is extremely valuable. Idk fuck all these idiots, I appreciate your impeccable work done here ü´°"
2025-03-06,"Hey there! Just wanted to say thanks for posting this. I *did* read it all, found it useful, and appreciate the effort you put into it."
2025-02-19,I get what you mean! In general the AirPods Pro 2 are pretty comfortable for long use because of the soft silicone tips. Much better from the Airpods 3 that I had
2025-02-21,"I had other ones before, but after using Vionentus wallets for a year, I switched to their AirPods case as well. Now I can really see the difference from my old case it‚Äôs so much better especially the leather."
2025-01-26,have you ever got someone to talk to?
2024-12-29,Cuz it‚Äôs better than replying to a 40-day old post
2025-01-27,i want to get it just for that LOL
2024-11-27,"yeah that‚Äôs been my experience :), i wont generalize though, but i am also a headphones enthusiast with like 6 pairs of headphones for different occasions and purposes"
2024-11-20,"People read what they find interesting, regardless of length.

It's pretty poor form for an author to blame the reader for their writing being too boring"
2024-11-21,no lol just a common format used for retention span on apps nowadays
2024-11-20,"the AAP2 have a newer chip, and everyone on here universally says the sound is way better , I think maybe my ears are just shot"
2024-11-20,"Surface pro. Audio doesn‚Äôt work on either teams or Google meet.

Gone through the support and it‚Äôs a dead end, just an issue with the Bluetooth, noise cancellation and the way teams and meet work."
2024-11-28,"I mean I‚Äôm currently a full time college student about to be doing post grad work, I spend most of my week reading shit way more complicated than your shitty AirPods review lol. I think you just want something to argue about online man. Either way you‚Äôre being rude as fuck to people for no reason. I‚Äôm sorry if there‚Äôs something going on in your life that is hard or if somebody has hurt you in some way, I hope things get better man‚Ä¶"
2025-01-23,Cry
2024-11-21,Never learned to read. My bad.
2024-11-21,Some things aren't worth reading.
2024-11-20,It‚Äôs true. Bro even said 3 paragraphs was too long.
2024-11-22,"Then what would you like the review to say ""*It iz good, buy now*"".  Some folks like long form reviews.  It takes skill to give a detailed breakdown and cover things a consumer would want to know.

The mighty short attention span will doom our species."
2025-02-01,"agreed. if you don't want the details, the conclusions are at the bottom. if you actually want to investigate all the claims about the product, OP provided them! obviously, care went into this review. not sure why that would bother a potential customer. again, if you don't want to read it, don't. no one's holding a gun to your head"
2024-12-30,That reply makes no sense.
2024-11-27,i have a few myself haha
2024-11-21,"""am i so out of touch? No...its the children who are wrong."""
2024-11-20,"ahh, good point, mea culpa."
2024-11-28,"Argue online? Bitch you‚Äôre the one who came at me lol, and if you‚Äôre doing such important work and your time is so important that you can‚Äôt be bothered, then shouldn‚Äôt you be doing that instead of browsing the AirPods Pro subreddit and arguing with strangers online? I‚Äôm just existing and you decided to be adversarial. Don‚Äôt twist it"
2024-11-21,But are worth commenting. Tiktok brainers logic :D
2024-11-21,"It's too long for what it is. 3 paragraphs of an interesting story is nothing and I'd happily read it. 

3 paragraphs of a review from someone I don't know for a TLDR is boring and a waste of my time"
2025-02-21,"Yeah long form is fine, and yes we do have a short attention span. But THIS IS JUST POOR WRITING. The dude uses like 3 long sentences to convey a single, simple thought. It‚Äôs fluff."
2025-01-01,cuz yours dont
2025-01-07,Huh?
2024-11-29,Ive had my pro 2s for two years and love them. I have other high end pairs and the Pro 2 dominates them
2024-11-29,"Go try the Pro2 at an Apple Store, you will love the clarity and the bass, instrument separation is fantastic too. No comparison. But the pro2, you won‚Äôt regret it. Invest in yourself!"
2024-11-29,"Just got them. I like them so far, but I got them for a good deal in the states $153, as there are holiday sales going on now. I‚Äôm not sure how much I would like them for $100 more. When you say ‚Äúare they worth it‚Äù it‚Äôs hard to say. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd spend my last $250 on them. But as an upgrade over the AirPod Gen3, which I‚Äôve been using for a while, I‚Äôd say they are ‚Äúworth‚Äù it."
2024-11-29,"I use mine all the time, and prefer the gen 2 to the gen 1. the main feature I appreciate with the newer pair is the volume adjustment on the AirPods themselves. Super handy that I never have to pull out my phone at all to skip/rewind or adjust volume.  
However, if you only have an iPhone (no watch, iPad or Mac), then there might be other cheaper alternatives."
2024-11-29,"Yes. I have 3 sets. I bought my first set when they came out. Bought a second set just to leave at work. Then a third when the usbc models dropped. They all work great. My original set has some battery degradation, they aren‚Äôt terrible but I use them constantly so with that being considered, they‚Äôve been fantastic. I‚Äôll prob never buy another brand again. I don‚Äôt like over the ear headphone, so with everything as a package, for in ears, app2‚Äôs are def worth it"
2024-11-29,Depends on the amount of money you have but I see the value proposition. It‚Äôs become to me a ‚Äúmust-have‚Äù. I wouldn‚Äôt buy if I was tight with money though.
2024-11-29,Yes
2024-11-30,"I have them and a whole bunch of other earbuds. They are worth the money only if you need the transparency mode/ hearing aid or if you really need VERY good ANC. In any other scenario, no, they are not worth the money. In my case , I'm using the CMF buds pro 2 connected to both my phones and the experience is excellent. OnePlus buds 3/3 pro could be another excellent option (a bit more costly tho). Search scarbir on Google"
2024-11-29,Got it for $129 worth every pennies.
2024-11-30,"Yes, absolutely yes."
2024-11-30,Yes they are definitely worth the money. Even just for the noise cancelation. Even without music you can just tune out at work or on a plane - they are great quality- and especially worth it if you already have an iphone/apple ecosystem. That said the Bose Ultra Quietcomfort II earbuds are even better - no joke
2024-11-29,Absolutely not. Their initial firmware is great. Unbelievable noise cancelling. Then they will update themselves and become essentially useless. Do not buy AirPods
2024-11-29,"I just bought mine but waiting to pick them up. From what I have read and heard, it‚Äôs a noticeable difference from Pro 1."
2024-11-29,"I picked them up for 170‚Ç¨, they are alright for this price... I guess. For 289‚Ç¨, I don't think so"
2024-11-29,"I‚Äôll be honest, coming from AirPods 3 they were a LOT better than I expected. Make sure you use the correct tips for you and they should sound superb for their size. I absolutely love them and never really use my AirPods Max now."
2024-11-29,"I got mine not too long ago.

Honestly, I'm iffy about them, just personally speaking.

The noise cancellation on the first gen was SO MUCH BETTER than these with their weird Active Noise Cancelation.  
With the first gens, I bought them at a Best Buy and tried them out there and it completely canceled all the noise from the busy environment, it Actually kinda blew me away at the time.

I Just bought the Air pod pro 2 recently, and it just doesn't seem like it cancels ANY noise at all, even with both air pods in and full noise canceling active. But maybe I'm just in a louder environment than I was before, so I'm fine just sitting on the fence about that one.

The one MAJOR gripe I have is that they just simply hurt my ears.  
I have no idea what exactly it is, but I've tried every single tip large to small, including aftermarket tips and they just hurt my ear and I can't tell why.  
The air pod pros, I used the smallest ear tip and they fit PERFECTLY so much that I'd fully forget I was wearing headphones at times, especially with the Listen Through feature.



But the air pod pro 2? I stg I can feel the irritation on my ears after less than half an hour.



If I could go back in time, I'd 100% get the first gen air pod pros all over again.



I've had:  
Air pods, Air pod first to 4th gen, and air pod pro 1st and 2nd gen, and the first gen air pod pro was by far the Best out of all of them, in terms of sound quality and comfort. 



tldr2nd gen sounds GREAT, the ANC is \*\*okay\*\* at best but that's whatever to me.  
But they just HURT my ear and I could never figure out why."
2024-11-29,"If you like the in ear with tips go for it they are fabulous, if you don‚Äôt like the fitted tips go for the ordinary AirPods (I had gen3, not tried gen4)"
2024-11-29,"I‚Äôve had the AirPods Pro 2 for a while, and tbh, they‚Äôre great if you care about noise canceling and sound quality. The transparency mode is super natural too. But if you‚Äôre not using those features daily, there might be cheaper options that still sound good."
2024-11-29,In the UK / US they are on sale now for like ¬£140-160
2024-11-29,No guarantee but my original pros are 4 years old this Christmas and going strong - except for one incident where the case broke entirely and wouldn‚Äôt connect. That was fixed by smacking it on a desk. Hopefully these are as durable which might mean you can consider it price/lifespan $per year
2024-11-29,"Apple gear is expensive but it‚Äôs great quality. A bit overpriced, but great."
2024-11-29,Use my 2‚Äôs all the time amazing invention! Use mine all the time. ANC is unreal
2024-11-29,Getting mine tomorrow. God bless Black Friday üòÇ
2024-11-29,"Absa-effing-lutely

They are solid. Second best gadget/tech I have ever purchased in my 35 years as a techie.

290 euro seems steep though? I got mine on sale for 175 british pounds"
2024-11-29,"Bro, it is worthy to say that AirPods Pro 2 is an absolute beast! One of the best product out there! I use AirPods Pro as a Hearing Aids, although, I‚Äôm soon going to buy an actual Hearing Aids again, but this AirPods Pro blows my mind with the Active Noise Cancellation and the Hearing Aids (note that Hearing Aids isn‚Äôt made for severe hearing loss). Also, my AirPods Pro 2 last 6hrs 20mins which is crazy but still not good because I use this as a hearing aids so I want them to be 12hrs of Battery Life :/"
2024-11-29,I have pro 2s and love them. I had the pro 1s before though and I can‚Äôt tell the difference between them other than a couple minor features. I‚Äôd get them if you don‚Äôt have any pros but I would spend the money upgrading if you already have the 1s
2024-11-29,They work great with Apple TV
2024-11-29,Yup! Also get AppleCare+! Just got a whole new set of pros for free! Battery replacements! Still 4 months of AppleCare left! Delivered on black Friday no less!
2024-11-29,"Got my pro 2 today and damn their good, fits good I my ear (even when running) compared to my EarPods, and the sound is amazing."
2024-11-30,"Def do it now if you‚Äôre gonna, got mine off a target circle for 129"
2024-11-30,I have the first version as well but they developed a rattle after a couple of years so I bought a pair. No regrets. The first version is still good but version two are great.
2024-11-30,Absolutely.
2024-11-30,"Yes they are worth it. To preface what Im going to say next, I want to say that I have dropped my AirPods a lot, overcharged them, and dropped water on one of them, they withstood most of these actions. I had the AirPods Pro for 4 years now and I‚Äôm only replacing them because the charging case doesn‚Äôt hold much battery and one AirPod doesn‚Äôt have good sound compared to the other AirPod"
2024-11-30,Yah they‚Äôre rly good. I just got sm called nothing ear from work and they‚Äôre cool but I still use the AirPods bc they have better transparency and noice cancellation. Like music sounds a little better on the other ones but I I still like the AirPods better
2024-11-30,"I have the pro 2s since a week now and I am more than excited! They fit perfectly without disturbing me in any way, even after some hours it doesn‚Äôt hurt my ears even a bit. And I don‚Äôt have the feeling they could fall out of my ears. If the transparency mode is activated (and the music is not too loud) the surrounding can be heard very clear, if noise cancellation is activated voices and noises around me are nearly completely faded out. Really amazing!
The sound quality blew me away! Very clear, very precise and an impressive bass. I had a couple of different earphones but the pro 2s are playing in a totally different league. I never would have thought that they‚Äòd thrilled me that much.

Isn‚Äôt there a way that you buy them from another country where you can get them much cheaper?"
2024-11-30,"My pair just survived a wash AND dry cycle, which my previous non-Pro ones did not, I‚Äôm amazed."
2024-11-30,"So I have been using Liberty Pro 3s for a couple of years and have had my eye on Air Pod Pros for a few years but could never justify the cost. I also recently got them on an open box sale for ¬£154.

I would say that anyone point is amazing. To be honest I expected amazing noise cancellation but I would say it‚Äôs not that much better than a liberty pro 3 but it is noticeable. Sound quality as well is good but not overwhelming. But what does it for me is they just work. I have an Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad and Apple TV. It works with everything. The adaptive noise cancelling and then just normal noise cancellation but notices when you speak it lowers it if you are talking to someone. Saying hey siri with no button press. List goes on and on that they are just better. Not a single amazing feature but overall the simple ease and functionality are unbeatable."
2024-11-30,"I have never used airpod pro2, but airpod 4 anc was mind blowing. I think airpods pro 2 has a better feature/noice cancelling, so yes it will be worth every penny.

the biggest difference i found between pro2 and airpod 4 anc is noise cancellation, really, and maybe volume control."
2024-11-30,So you come to the airpods subreddit to ask if the top of the line buds are worth it? lmfao
2024-11-30,I love them. I also have an Apple Watch. I hate the watch.
2024-11-30,"I‚Äôve had them for 1-2 years I love them with my 13 pm
* Plan on getting the AirPods Max for the iPhone 16 pm

Only negative is the noise cancellation is heavily dependent on your silicone fit. 
* Too small and they hurt my ears though. Never something I think about at a 7am bus ride but if it‚Äôs jam packed like going to an airport. 

I think a bigger one with 30h battery time would be better. 
* I‚Äôm somewhere between 3-6h battery until I need a 15 min charge to get through the rest of my day.

Pretty sure black week has some good prices under 200$ to look around"
2024-11-30,"bro mine actually suck. I thought I was upgrading from the beats fit pros, and it‚Äôs a downgrade. the only thing that‚Äôs better is the nodding/shaking your head to answer prompts, and it has a better transparency mode. it‚Äôs crisper. WHEN IT WORKS!!!!! But 90% of the time when using transparency mode, it starts to skip the music, then disconnects. Can‚Äôt even go 10 minutes without it happening. If noise cancellation is on it‚Äôs fine, but i‚Äôd rather have some awareness while walking. 

Long story short they‚Äôre glitchy. REALLY glitchy. There‚Äôs actually a lawsuit you can look up. Go the beats route they‚Äôre 98% as good (although I like bass so the sound quality I enjoy more), and in 2 years it‚Äôs never glitched out on me. I find myself using those more. They fit better too.

rant over."
2024-11-30,"Yea sound quality is 9/10 
Sweat proof 
& you can adjust volume from the earbud itself"
2024-11-30,"As someone who paid 250 USD for my AirPods, I can say they are definitely some of the best sounding earbuds I‚Äôve ever used, and if you use Apple Music and leverage spatial audio as well as spatial audio on Netflix, it‚Äôs a game changer‚Ä¶ Also kind of cool to be able to nod my phone to answer phone calls or shake my head not to decline them. That‚Äôs fun."
2024-11-30,For $160. There are no better ones
2024-11-30,They are on sale at Walmart for 160cdn
2024-11-30,They‚Äôre outstanding. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll beat them for the money.
2024-11-30,"I have Gen 1 still. 
I do hear static noises here and there. 
But I‚Äôm still going to use it"
2024-11-30,They‚Äôre my least used pair. Hurt my ears and slip with minimal exercise or movement. They get bumped and have too much grip on my ear. Now the noise cancelling and crackling is back to being shit after I already replaced the pods themselves after only having them about 6 months. When they work they are the best sound from an ear bud. But it‚Äôs not worth the drawbacks at that price in my opinion. I‚Äôm getting the 4‚Äôs with anc for Christmas and it‚Äôs nice because I have been waiting for that hardware pretty much since the pros came out.
2024-11-30,"289‚Ç¨ üò≥ 
Are you by any chance from üáπüá∑?"
2024-11-30,"I just upgraded my APP to the Pro 2 and I can say the Surround Dolby thing sounds way better, the Adaptive is impressively good. I have a loud sports care and in adaptive turns it down by 40% which is crazy. Also more base slightly than the last version. Overall I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth the money on sale"
2024-11-30,I just got them last week for $288 aud and ive used them everyday and love them so worth it
2024-11-30,If you have an iPhone and are looking for earbuds then AirPods Pro 2 are a no brainer! Especially with all the sales on right now
2024-11-30,"Pro: Sound stage is amazing ( clarity even at the highest volume . 
Amazing ANC . 
Great battery life.
Seemless integration with other apple device.
Compact size ( use a case once u get it as it will get scratched easily in your pocket ) .

Cons : none for me so far ( using for more than a year) .
PS: also if you don‚Äôt need anc u can consider buying the wired apple headphones, I use the usb c one and barring anc it‚Äôs as good as app2 in my opinion ."
2024-11-30,"I‚Äôm 67 so my ears don‚Äôt work the best.  I absolutely love my pro 2‚Äôs.  I use them for zoom calls all work day long.  Then to watch the tele at night. Weekends tune up some tunes.  I love all the modes, transparency, noise cancellation and adaptive.  I‚Äôve even started using them as a hearing aid when I‚Äôm physically present for meetings.  They have yet to disappoint me.  Best money I‚Äôve spent.   They switch flawlessly between the iPhone, iPad and MacBook."
2024-11-30,Love them although not happy that apple upgraded the standard airpods and not come out with an even better pro version.  Yep love me pro 2s - I also own apple pro max over head earphones but the very best for noise cancellation is Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Headphones
2024-11-30,yes they are 100% worth it. i love mine
2024-11-30,I just bought a pair and I‚Äôm loving them so far. Coming from a dead pair of Jabra Elite 75t wireless earbuds that stopped holding a charge after 4 years of abuse.
2024-11-30,"289‚Ç¨ is a lot for a product with a 2 year old chip. The AirPods Pro are due an upgrade and Pro 3 could come out mid 2025. I would wait and buy that. 
Now if you‚Äôre getting a deal on Black Friday and are getting it for under 200 I would say go for it."
2024-11-30,I just bought them after holding out for years because I have perfectly good jabra earbuds. I will say the seamless integration with iPhone makes it so worth it!!! Totally locked into the Apple ecosystem now though
2024-11-30,I got them last Xmas and am blown away by the sound and the functionality if you use an iPhone. IOS 18.1 introduced a hearing aid feature which is really interesting if you are older or have hearing loss.
2024-11-30,"Yes, I bought pro 1at launch, bought pro 2 at launch, last year. Now Target (US) sell pro 2 for $128, I bought extra two for my family."
2024-11-30,"I  bought them a couple of days ago, but already tested them thoroughly. They are phenomenal, music and podcasts sound very good and calls tell me that I am heard perfectly. I live in a big city and last night I ran for two hours in the middle of the city (very noisy environment due to traffic and many people) and I could hear the music perfectly (Pink Floyd) at low volume, it seemed like it was the middle of the night when the city is sleeping and there is no one around, when in reality it was rush hour. Same thing at work, very noisy, here I can only use one earphone (I listened to several podcasts) also in this case perfect, they allow you to listen to the entire podcast perfectly at low volume, narration voice always crystal clear. bought with Black Friday ... exceptional"
2024-11-30,"100% - recently went swimming with them in my shorts pocket out the case, then sauna and then rinse shower and they still worked fine. Beast in ear headphones/buds ever built."
2024-11-30,"hell yea, the modes are so useful especially transparency. Though you have to be careful not to get then too dirty cause the quality will diminish."
2024-11-30,After owning samsung buds sony xm4 earbuds and then AirPods pro 2 is the best i ever owned specially if you have tiny ear like me just but it you wont regret .
2024-11-30,"Keep them clean tho, I just replaced my right airpod pro for 118$ after 2 years of use."
2024-11-30,I recently upgraded from my AirPods Pro 2 Lightning to USB-C ones. Can't have it any other way. They're indispensable for me.
2024-11-30,"i have them, they‚Äôre okay if it isn‚Äôt windy, because the mics pick it up and amplify it like 5x whether nc is active or not"
2024-11-30,"Yep they‚Äôre amazing, have had them for 2 years now"
2024-11-30,They are worth the money but 290EUR is a bit too much at this point. Is there any way you can get somebody to get them to you from another EU country? They‚Äôre 173EUR on amazon.de at the moment.
2024-11-30,Well I‚Äòm convinced they‚Äòre worth the money alone for the ANC already. I consider them crucial for using public transportation and give me the chills even in crowded situations. I just love them because of this.
2024-11-30,It's the best Apple product literally for me
2024-11-30,"I bought mine a couple of weeks ago while it was on sale  (at a local store) and the experience so far has been satisfactory.

PROS: The ANC is decent (although sometimes it‚Äôs a hit or miss at certain places) and the audio quality when listening to music is amazing. The main reason I love it is because of its auto device switching feature, it works like a charm when you‚Äôre switching between Apple devices at a time. 

CONS: Mic quality is horrendous if you‚Äôre not in a silent room. It just got worse in the recent firmware update (btw you don‚Äôt have a choice to upgrade or not, they force it on you) 

All and all I‚Äôd say purchase it ONLY if it‚Äôs on sale. I can‚Äôt justify paying full price for it because of some of the cons."
2024-11-30,"Yes !! And Amazon has them on sale for $153 right now this very moment - bought them 2 days ago & there brand new , non refurbished air pod pro 2 h2 chip 

Sold by Amazon 

Deff worth it , and almost $100 off for Black Friday - cop them 

https://a.co/d/b8oSjVX"
2024-11-30,Yup
2024-11-30,"Is there no Black Friday deal now?

I wouldn‚Äôt pay 289 but if you can find them around the 200 tag I‚Äôd say go for it. Bought them on September two years ago and it‚Äôs the product I‚Äôve been happiest with and use every freaking single day"
2024-11-30,They are amazing honestly‚Ä¶joined the club recently and I am a big fan.
2024-11-30,"Definitely worth it. I had the AirPods Pro 1 since 2019 and was happy with them. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt think the Pro 2 would be much different. But last week, I bought the Pro 2 because it was on sale, and oh my gosh, the difference is like night and day! 

The sound on the Pro 2 is so much better‚Äîit feels like I‚Äôm using a completely different pair of headphones!"
2024-11-30,YES
2024-11-30,"I have them but prefer the AirPod 4 with active noise canceling, the noise canceling is better on the pros but the sacrifice in noise canceling is worth it for the improvement in comfort on the 4s for me. I just say this to point out ear shape can be a factor, as the pro  for me don‚Äôt fit as well and are less comfortable."
2024-11-30,They‚Äôre great but the battery life is pretty poor compared to my Powerbeats Pro
2024-12-01,they‚Äôre‚Ä¶something‚Ä¶ but nice for commutes. still prefer my over ear headphones but the ap2 are great for noise cancelling etc
2024-12-01,"Yes if you have an iPhone full stop. Everything is straight forward and the anc is really really good. I already saw that some people are bringing up specific headphones that have better anc. Yes it‚Äôs not the best but you will feel weird the first time you turn on anc.  No good way to explain but they also sound really good for wireless iems. 

I don‚Äôt understand why Reddit is so hateful"
2024-12-01,"If you like the gummies that stick out of the part that sound comes out of, yes. Otherwise go for a different model.

One obnoxious thing is that you have to adjust the volume of notifications every time you want to use them vs not use them. If you always have your phone on vibrate, this isn‚Äôt an issue, but for someone who normally has text message notification volume on 100% // or alarm volume on 100%, if you forget to change it when putting your earbuds in, you will definitely get hearing loss problems.

Another issue is that once dust, dirt or earwax gets into the mesh, it is impossible to clean it out. Over time, it will affect the sound and your only choice to have crisp audio again will be to get new ones.¬†

If your mind is set on getting some, you can get them way cheaper online. 289‚Ç¨ is way too expensive. I got some yesterday for $160. Try shopping Apple‚Äôs online store or Best Buy‚Äôs store, especially on Cyber Monday. Idk if your country acknowledges Cyber Monday but you can always try getting it shipped from America for cheaper, I can‚Äôt imagine overseas charges would add up to more than what you say it costs over there."
2024-12-01,Love them! Having them for I think a year and a half now and work totally fine! üíñ‚ú® get them with the BF sales!
2025-03-25,I bought mine a couple of weeks ago and I just returned them today. There is no difference from the first one to the second one.
2024-11-30,Get airpods 4 the are better and cheaper
2024-11-29,"Nah, honestly if you aren‚Äôt in a place to get good sales ( Black Friday in the US) you should go for the AirPod gen 4‚Äôs with noise cancellation. Pros are crazy good but I like my Gen 4‚Äôs better ( parents have the pro 2‚Äôs). Only main difference is the ear tips which seals a lot more sound in and prevents a lot more sound from getting in. I don‚Äôt like that feature though, it makes my ears feel a little too plugged, whereas the gen 4 AirPods with noise cancellation have pretty good ANC, but they feel more sleek and better fitting for me."
2024-11-29,"Nope, I'm not happy with the sound quality. The ""gadgets"" in them are nice, but I'm interested in the sound and should be way better for the price tag"
2024-11-30,Dominates them how?

2024-11-29,Thank you
2024-11-30,"I've went through 4 airpods pros first gen and second gens and they always end up breaking(ANC, transparency making a noise and battery life becomes worthless). For how much they go for, it's safe to say plastic doesn't cost 260 euros and using last gen 5.3 bluetooth, i'd expect them to use 6.0 bluetooth and to top that all of no multipoint and no codecs."
2024-11-29,I dont have any airpods yet
2024-11-30,"I got them at 180 cad so roughly 128 usd brand hew and I would still be quite happy to pay more because of how good the battery life, sound, noise cancellation is compared to the previous gen"
2024-11-30,"Since you use it all the time, how are you not worried about getting ear damage? Do you have some safety measures turned on?"
2024-11-29,I have a watch and iphone but nothing else
2024-11-29,So after 2 years they are still really good?
2024-12-01,"I had some sort of static noise with mine instantly right out of the package doesnt matter which mode i was on, decided to give them back, i assume thats normal? Even tough ive seen many complaints online"
2024-11-30,How‚Äôd you get that price?
2024-11-29,from where?
2024-11-29,I dont have any airpods yet so If im gonna buy any I want the best so I can have them for a long time
2024-11-29,Wow thats all good to know. I cant find airpods 1 anywhere are they not selling them anymore? I also never had noise cancelation so I wont really see how better the first ones were. I am worried about my ears hurting but the basic ones I have tried from friends and they dont stay in my ears so I think this would be a better option. I dont know what I will do I have never had any airpods so Im still thinking about it. Thank you for all of this info
2025-02-23,Airpods pro 2 are literally the same outer shell as the airpod pro 1. Did you get some fake 2s?
2024-11-29,I do like the fitted tips the ordinary I have tried from a friend and they just dont stay in my ears
2024-11-29,I do want them mostly for those options I have never had any good ones with any type of noise canceling and I would really like that
2024-11-29,Who sells them for ¬£140?
2024-11-29,Im not from US or UKüòî

2024-11-29,I would get 4‚Äôs without thinking if all of those originals didnt fall out of my ear üòû
2024-11-30,"Better sound, ANC, spacial"
2024-12-05,Yeah
2024-11-30,"The AirPods Pro (2nd generation) were released on September 23, 2022."
2024-11-30,You're talking about the re-release with usb C port
2024-11-30,"Valid point! No, when I say I use them all the time it‚Äôs more that I use them daily during commutes and such - not literally all the time!  
I also use the noice threshold to avoid blasting my ears at full volume - and so far I am doing excellent on my yearly health checks, which also include hearing health. I‚Äôm glad you brought this up, though, more people should be aware of how using headphones regularly without afterthought could impact their hearing!"
2024-11-30,"Then there might be cheaper alternatives if you‚Äôre on a budget. They are still great, and as far as I‚Äôm aware you could use only pre-downloaded stuff on the watch (or streamed if you have the eSIM-edition)."
2024-11-29,"Yeah, sound is still perfect. There is some battery loss on the pods themselves, haven‚Äôt noticed on the case but it‚Äôs not bad. They charge so fast though, it‚Äôs really not an issue. I haven‚Äôt compared side by side either though. All in all, they‚Äôre still great"
2024-11-30,"I only just bought some on sale for about ‚Ç¨180 as my AirPods Pro died after about a year, and Apple hasn‚Äôt accepted responsibility to replace them despite the other recall they‚Äôve done of AirPods Pro. I had gone back to my old AirPods and unless you really need noise cancelling or other special ‚Äòpro‚Äô features, I‚Äôm not convinced that an amount over ‚Ç¨250 is worth it compared with the Beats that I love!"
2024-11-30,If you have target account or credit card with them you‚Äôll get even cheaper. They currently have coupons if you spend $150 you‚Äôll get $25 off.
2024-11-29,It was a short lived Black Friday deal from one of the main mobile network operators in my country
2024-11-29,Then get the pro 2s fs
2024-11-29,Costco have a Black Friday deal on for ¬£159. Haven't seen them cheaper
2024-11-30,it was on sale from amazon until two weeks ago for $180 (\~¬£140)
2024-11-30,Whaat?! Wow. ¬£50 for me. ¬£229 to ¬£179
2024-11-29,"Wow okay fair enough, I mean they are good but maybe there is some alternative in your country that offers same quality for cheaper price? Sony?

Do you use iPhone as well?"
2024-11-29,"No problem! Make sure to check out the latest deal, unfortunately, I‚Äôm in US so I got AirPods Pro with AppleCare+ in just $199. As of now, Black Friday deals made it even crazy, going low as $154 on Amazon and Target, although you‚Äôre not from US so that‚Äôs a bad luck for you! üò≠"
2024-11-30,I‚Äôd say get them for sure. I love mine
2024-11-30,That‚Äôs way way too much! ü§Ø
2024-11-30,"Lol no way. 

Sony MX5s have much better ANC, spatial and sound. 

AirPods have better integration with iPhones but that‚Äôs about it."
2024-11-30,I‚Äôm seeing them for $169.99 right now. Hmmm
2024-11-29,Germany?
2024-11-29,I will look into that thank you
2024-11-29,"Yes I use Iphone
I was looking into some alternatives but idk I will check what else is there for sure before I buy"
2024-11-29,Yess If I had those deals I wouldnt be thinking about it I would just buy themüòÇ
2024-11-30,You‚Äôre comparing over the ear headphones with ear buds. It‚Äôs not exactly a fair comparison
2024-11-30,"I agree, the Sonys sound 1000 times better!! I have a lot of pairs of tws and frankly my AirPods Pro 2 are just for calls on the go, videos are everything when it comes to music the wf1000xm5 are way ahead for me the best ANC, I use them in anc at the gym, the passive anc is so excellent! The sound is Sony, very well managed no matter the style chosen and very open! 

Everyone knows that the AirPods Pro 2 sound much better without anc without spatial audio (more natural) but it remains generic, very well integrated into the Apple ecosystem"
2024-11-30,"I also have Bose QCU‚Äôs an Sennheiser true sport which sound really good, but the Pro 2‚Äôs just sound better"
2024-11-29,You‚Äôre welcome
2024-11-30,It‚Äôs changed few hours ago.
2024-11-30,Walmart has them for $154
2024-11-29,cheers mate
2024-11-29,"Yeah come up with a shortlist of options, maybe if there is something much cheaper.

Otherwise if there isn't then yeah these earphones are very good choice for iPhone users"
2024-11-29,Gotcha! ü§ì
2024-11-30,"No, I‚Äôm comparing Sony earbuds with Apple earbuds. 

Bose earbuds also have better ANC and arguably better sound.

2024-11-30,"Bah, that was my fear! I‚Äôll keep watching it in case it drops again. Enjoy your new pair!"
2024-11-30,You can price match and use $25 off for $150. If you register the account from Target.
2024-11-30,When I looked up Sony xm5‚Äôs all I found were the over the ear ones. Had to specifically add earbuds to the search for them to pop up. You right
2024-11-30,My airlods have always had better anc at the gym
2025-02-14,https://www.soundguys.com/airpods-pro-3-wait-124219/
2024-11-30,Yup. Check in Amazon its still in same price $154
2024-11-30,You ain‚Äôt google hard enough..
2025-02-15,lol ok
2025-02-15,So the guy you mention says they are the best (he owns it)
2025-02-16,He does not. He says they ‚Äúcan keep up‚Äù.
2024-05-05,pro gen 2 are worth it for me. sound cancelling is much better
2024-05-05,If you liked gen 1 you‚Äôll love gen 2. If you didn‚Äôt like gen 1 gen 2 probably won‚Äôt convince you.
2024-05-05,"Yes. I have the original AirPod Pros and there are some significant upgrades. 

Especially the tracking feature"
2024-05-05,YES!!! The noise canceling on these is amazing. My partner snores like a freight train and I can‚Äôt hear him at all with these in. WORTH EVERY PENNY!
2024-05-05,There incredible sound so so good
2024-05-05,I just went to a concert and these adaptive audio mode changed my life forever.
2024-05-06,Wait and see what the 2024 ones look like. They are supposed to a be a total overhaul
2024-05-05,"Yes, yes and hell yes. I had the gen 1s and upgraded to the 2s. The noise cancelling was already excellent, and these are even better."
2024-05-05,Tips are basically the same material but they do come in with different sizes to change them . I really like the adaption to sound.
2024-05-05,"Any generation AirPod Pro is 10000% better than any generation AirPod due to the tips. The difference the tips make is unreal. I would take a Gen 1 AirPod Pro over the latest AirPod any day of the week. There‚Äôs just no comparison in terms of comfort, fit, how well they stay in your ears (and thus how often you lose them), and sound quality.

On the other hand, AirPod Pro gen 3 is 1% better than AirPod Pro gen 1‚Äôs. I‚Äôve never succeeded in getting the side volume slider to work correctly. If you can use an AirPod Pro instead of an Airpod, always choose that option. But which version of the AirPod Pro you use does not matter. The only nice thing about the Gen 3 over Gen 2 is the USB-C connection instead of Lightning, and the only nice thing about the Gen 2 over Gen 1 is that it sticks to magnetic charging stations better (thus making which port it uses to charge irrelevant)

Try different tips. SpinDrift makes tips for AirPod Pros that come in more sizes and are more comfortable."
2024-05-05,Mine have the Problem that about half a year after buying them (directly from apple) the left earbud is significantly more quiet then the right one and I've seen no solution to fix it so far :(
2024-05-06,If the tips don‚Äôt work for you you can buy third party tips made of different materials. They‚Äôre worth it for sure either way
2024-05-06,If it‚Äôs on sale in your country definitely get it! I lost my older pair so I recently got the second gen. There are also additional settings
2024-05-06,"Worth every single penny, even at full price! I don‚Äôt know how I can fly without them, the noise cancelling feature is phenomenal üí™"
2024-05-06,"I got a pair recently to replace my original ones, and the ability to adjust the volume and activate the different modes makes them so worth it. My one gripe is that I don't really like the rubber nubs, I prefer the feel of a solid plastic piece. Had I known I would have definitely gotten a pair without the rubber ear nubs."
2024-05-06,"Bro i just got mine today because my left gen 1AirPods Pro started with crackling and white noise so I decided to upgrade to gen 2 and the sound quality is much better, also noise canceling and transparency modes are way better than Gen 1. Totally worth it"
2024-05-06,"Yes, but still a bit overpriced, at least in India it is the case."
2024-05-06,"I bought this 4 months ago and used it when working out , now the charging connectors have rust and even if it‚Äôs in warranty they won‚Äôt repair or replace the product. When I make calls my I have to adjust it a little bit so the other end can hear my voice. For me it‚Äôs a risky product if it works it works great but without good service and warranty this can easily become an expensive mistake like it feels for me."
2024-05-05,"Stick to the 3, my son got the pro 1 and didn‚Äôt fit me well and bought the 3 which are perfect. Now the pro 1 are busted and he got the pro 2, tested them last week and are the exact same fit as 1."
2024-05-05,Nope. Had mine for a year before they started doing the loud crackle static sound which physically hurt my ears. Tossing them was the best decision I could have made pertaining to them
2024-05-05,yes
2024-05-05,"Can‚Äôt get them to stay in my ears. Try end so many after market plugs. Dunno, my ears don‚Äôt like ear buds. I folded and went for the over ear apple headset. I way prefer everything about those ."
2024-05-05,I upgraded from Gen 1 and I‚Äôm absolutely blown away.
2024-05-05,Kinda ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  now your getting them for the apple ecosystem. For about half of the price you can get nothing a2 with the same specs. They also break easily. So I wouldnt buy them in 2024
2024-05-05,"I recently switched and yes, definitely!"
2024-05-05,"Best in ears concerning sound quality, they can even keep up with some better over ears. They are absolutely worth it, especially with the very good noise canceling snd the adaptive transparency they are a dream to use."
2024-05-05,"You can get custom made tips for the Pros that are made based on a scan from a audiometrist (is that the correct word for those people who make hearing aids?)

Quite pricey and I don‚Äôt have one of those, but might be worth having a look at it"
2024-05-05,"Yes, especially if you can get them for $179 or $189. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd pay full price for them seeing gen 3 will be out in the fall but if you can get them on sale (Amazon or Best Buy regularly have them for the prices I mentioned) then absolutely."
2024-05-05,Smokey!
2024-05-06,"Yes the transparency adaptive and the conversation detection makes it similar to the experience of wearing bone conduction headphones while blocking out unwanted noise.
While it‚Äôs not the same you can add a silicone cover with eartips to regular AirPods. But you won‚Äôt get transparency and anc and you have to take them on and off to charge"
2024-05-06,Loved the noise canceling in gen 2s but what surprised me the most is the adaptive transparency mode. Its so good
2024-05-06,Definitely worth it if you cool enough
2024-05-06,With 126 ms latency? Certainly worth it if you have money.
2024-05-06,Yeah imo. My wife has the Pro Max headphones and these have like 90% the same audio quality and noise cancelling (probably better noise cancelling if I‚Äôm being honest) at half the price. And they‚Äôre just really convenient to carry around.
2024-05-06,They are worth it. I wouldn‚Äôt have bothered to answer this thread if they weren‚Äôt.
2024-05-06,Absolutely. I work construction and the noise cancelling is perfect. The noise reduction is also incredible. I run that 80% of the time. It compresses loud sounds but I can still hear my guys.
2024-05-06,"Went from samsung buds 2 to airpods pro 2 gen usb. Sound quality is neck and neck, but noice cancelation is on another level."
2024-05-06,"I bought my 2nd gen pair because I lost my 1st gen pair, then I found my 1st gen pair :/ haven‚Äôt noticed too much of a difference"
2024-05-06,I love my gen 2 I‚Äôd buy them again if I needed to
2024-05-06,depends on ear
2024-05-06,"Absolutely , I just got some 2 weeks ago and don‚Äôt regret it one bit. That noise cancellation is amazing and always comes in clutch. Don‚Äôt even get me started on the Spatial Audio, all tho I think the AirPod gen 3 also has it. Transparency is also insanely good if you care about that"
2024-05-06,"I find these so uncomfortable, pros were a good investment"
2024-05-06,"Excellent Pods, I use the noise canceling on Plane flights... They come in Clutch when there is a Crying Brat on board"
2024-05-06,"For general use, they are amazing. But they are not low latency."
2024-05-06,"For me, the biggest difference from the Airpod Pro Gen1 and Gen 2 is transparency mode. Transparency mode in the gen 1's was good compared but the Gen 2's were the closest to normal hearing I've ever heard with any headphones I've owned. Better than the Sennheiser Momentums, Beoplay E2, Sony 1000xm5 and the gen1's. 

I also had problem with them falling out of my ears until I replaced the eartips with the Foam Master Memory Foam v4's.  These were a night and day difference for me and they don't fall out of my ears even after some activity. Kinda pricey though."
2024-05-06,"bought 2 pairs off the street for 50 bucks but

![gif](giphy|w0mylo7p4OXUQ)

and yeah they work great, audiophile here 2 üï∫üèª"
2024-05-06,"I'm new to the Apple ecosystem, well not new but haven't owned anything since the first ipod haha I'm a samsung user and have the airpod Pro 2s for my phone and laptop. 

The sound quality is really top notch, they sound great with good clarity. ANC is honestly amazing and the besr ive swen even compared to headphones, transparency is really nice too but i hardly, if ever, use it. 

The only con I've come across is the quality if the mic - its actually terrible, even more so at this price point. Ive been told the mic sounds distant, muted, or muffled and looking online on, on reddit and apple forums, this is a very common and known issue with no fix. 

My dad has an iphone that I used to check for updates and change settings, made a couple calls as well with the same issue, so the mic issue isnt because ""im not using an iphone"", even more so since apple forums are littered with the same issue lol 

I do say however, the pros outweigh the cons and im happy with my purchase. Well worth it."
2024-05-06,It depends with your needs. I think you‚Äôd be better off buying the previous gen as the changes are not that significant
2024-05-06,No get pros
2024-05-06,Yes! Adaptive Noise Cancellation is incredible.
2024-05-06,they are incredible! ü§©. the noise cancelling takes me away to my own world!
2024-05-06,"That picture is of regular AirPods, not AirPods Pro, isn't it?

I think the AirPods Pro 2 are quite good, fwiw."
2024-05-06,"Yes, everything that was wrong with the first gen, the second one optimised it and ANC is much better"
2024-05-06,Calling experience is really bad for the person who is trying to listen u. People always tell me I need new pair of headphones. Worst apple product. Noise canceling is really bad. The good: transparent mode and spatial sound mixed togueter bring a nice experience
2024-05-06,"The ANC is one of the best if not the best. I've tested the Sony's xm5s too and they're the only true competitors to the airpods pro gen 2. App2 are better because of the form factor and the seamless apple ecosystem.

PS: If you can, get an applecare plus for airpods. It will save a ton of money if they get damaged."
2024-05-06,I have both gen 1 and gen 2 pros. 2‚Äôs are way better in every way. Longer battery kind of similar noise cancelling effect.
2024-05-06,If u have more money left out in your bank account and u don't know how to spend it then airpods are 100% worth to buy
2024-05-06,I enjoyed getting the gen 2 pros. Better than the first gen but I handed those down for an upgrade excuse to get the new ones. I do like the newer features added to the case and the noise canceling is much better
2024-05-06,The ANC were so good as in you felt like drowning in a deep pool
2024-05-06,"I‚Äôve had AirPods1, Pro, and Pro gen 2. Pro gen 2 is superior to gen 1 on sound quality and adaptive audio. Also, and this may be minor to some, the ability to adjust the volume with a swipe on the earbud is a game changer for me."
2024-05-06,Well those are AirPods Gen 3 not AirPods Pro Gen 2
2024-05-06,The sound on these is great.  The problem for me is that they won't stay in my ears even with the largest tips.  I tried some of those foam tips on Amazon but those are no better.
2024-05-06,I feel like it‚Äôs the bass isn‚Äôt as strong as the first gen.
2024-05-06,I believe the tips are the same.
2024-05-06,"To me they were not, or at least not as much if I had bought them for full retail price. But they may be worth it for you, though. The ANC didn‚Äôt work well in my APP2‚Äôs."
2024-05-06,I did gen 3 because battery life was better but almost a year into them and the sound SUCKS!!!
2024-05-06,Yes..
2024-05-06,They have XS tips and you can also buy third party tips.
2024-05-08,https://amzn.to/3JRjmUf
2024-05-09,"If it‚Äôs only gonna be used on an Apple device, then yes, absolutely. My AirPods are without a doubt my favorite device. They are complete dog shit though when it comes to pairing it with anything else. I can never get a stable connection."
2024-05-09,"Yes!

I ended up buying mine randomly off some dude in Oakland who was selling a bunch of Apple Watches and AirPods out of his van‚Ä¶ You can‚Äôt beat $50 for brand new AirPod Pro 2 still in the plastic wrap! It made me wish I bought them legitimately SOONER!!! If I would have known how great they are I would have bought them for full price right when they came out."
2024-05-18,Every penny
2024-08-23,Air pods 2nd gen got good base ?
2024-10-13,Don‚Äôt pay 250 for them. You can get used or refurbished for half the price
2024-10-21,A definitive YES.  The Air Pod Pro 2's are incredible with the clarity of the no background noise when Noise Cancellation is enabled and the full range that they can produce. Absolutely a significant upgrade from the Air Pod Pro's. Better fit than the Air Pod Pro's. No distortion when the BASS is se to the max.  Overall are fantastic.
2025-03-22,I just want to see the feedback but idk how
2025-03-22,So new to this
2024-05-05,you might as well get a pair of Bose Quiet comfort buds for the noise cancellation and audio quality is about the same in my opinion
2024-05-05,"The tips are made from the same material. The only difference is that they now also include an xs size. You can purchase after market/third party ear tips made from different materials and are offered in even more sizes HOWEVER I doubt they would change your experience with them positively since what causes your problem (sweat and wax buildup) are from having ear tips in the first place.

I have recently ordered a few tips from Comply that are made of foam that apparently offer a better seal which improve sound quality and potentially comfort as they mould to your ear and a few more tips from a brand I can‚Äôt remember that are a combination of foam and silicone like the apple ones that would offer better longevity than the foam tips mentioned above. They can be a little pricey for what they are but I‚Äôm hoping they bring a lot of value as I use my airpods a lot. I‚Äôve got the 2nd gen non type C and honestly sq may be a little better than the og‚Äôs but when you‚Äôre out and about and being active I can‚Äôt really tell. I haven‚Äôt gotten to try any of the tips yet if you‚Äôre interested in what I think send me a message in about 4 weeks cause I‚Äôm overseas and haven‚Äôt tried them yet."
2024-05-05,"Nah.  Not loud enough , the mic is trash ."
2024-05-05,Search this sub for ‚Äúworth it‚Äù and you‚Äôll get literally dozens of posts answering this exact question
2024-05-06,Airpods are never worth it..  theres so much better stuff out there
2024-05-05,"No.
Overpriced battery powered nonsense with a half eaten apple printed on it is not worth it.

A pair of 30 euro Chifis sounds better that apples mess they call headphones."
2024-05-05,Naa
2024-05-05,"If you pay full price, then no. I bought them on eBay for $100. Pay more than that and you‚Äôll feel scammed."
2024-05-05,Nope.
2024-05-06,Are the Pro Gen 2 worth picking up with the Gen 3 coming out in a few months?
2024-05-05,Is it enough for airplanes?
2024-06-29,"Am I losing my mind? I just got these exclusively for the ANC that everyone is talking about and they cancel out about as much noise, with ANC on, as my 1s do without it on. Very disappointed and returning them."
2024-05-05,I did not like one but love 2
2024-05-06,Yes!! The tracking is quite a bit better!
2024-05-05,Suggest to your partner to look into getting tested for Sleep apnea.
2024-05-05,Isn‚Äôt a simple ear plug cheaper?
2024-05-05,You used them during the concert?
2024-08-26,"Thank you so much for saying this: I have been using earplugs and I don‚Äôt get any help from it, so this is a phenomenal tip!!!!!"
2024-05-06,The Pro 3s arnt due until 2025 I believe
2024-05-05,Just go to the Apple Store and they‚Äôll test and replace them. Apple‚Äôs very good like that.
2024-05-05,Mine have crackled since day 1!  Apple support not helpful yet.
2024-05-05,Deff don‚Äôt break easy
2024-05-06,"Are you sure yours are original? My pro 2 are excellent at sound quality, noise cancelling and also microphone is clear and crisp.
Note that fakes also have these features"
2024-05-05,The airpods sound better if you check online for the frequency response graph. If u can't tell the difference means there's smth wrong
2024-05-07,"Lol Pro Gen 3 isn't even coming out this year, let alone few months"
2024-05-05,"Did a fair bit of plane travelling in the month of March, flew 4 different times, two connecting flights and honestly the AirPods Pro 2 were a god send. Came off the plane not feeling as fatigued as normal, whether that was simply down to less noise, more peace and quiet, I‚Äôll let anyone else be the judge but personally it felt that way to me."
2024-05-06,"Yes, for short flights. Not really for long flights.

NYC <-> LA is absolutely perfect but anything longer you're gonna have to sit and wait until the APP2 are charged. You'll find the noise cancellation equal to the Sony XM4's (my only point of reference)."
2024-05-06,"There pretty good if your also playing music i personally use airpods max which are literally insanely good for plane travels.

If you travel alot id probably recommend that investment"
2024-05-06,I work in a fairly loud factory and I have had people screaming at me and couldn‚Äôt hear them (please don‚Äôt use around dangerous machines).
2024-05-05,Mine ran out of battery 3/4 way through the 3.5 hour flight
2024-05-06,Very much yes
2024-05-06,"The NC yes, but if you are prone to ear suck, the pressure feeling after long periods of use, airpods have been pretty bad for that in my experience, especially on planes."
2024-05-06,"I have both APP2 and Sony XM3, and tbh, you‚Äôre better off, like WAY better off with headphones"
2024-05-06,Most definitely yes sir very much so
2024-05-07,"My noise cancelling cancelled out the fire alarm in my school, which is criminally loud, so noise cancelling is great üëç"
2024-05-09,"Tbh, I can‚Äôt hear a damn thang with no sound playing and just the earbuds in! 

My girlfriend tries talking to me when I‚Äôm doing chores and pausing my music usually doesn‚Äôt work, I have to pull them out my ears to hear what she‚Äôs saying"
2024-07-04,"the 2's are waaay better than the 1's, at least that was my xp"
2024-05-05,How?
2024-05-06,idkw but i giggled at this
2024-05-05,"He definitely has it. He is a US Vet that acquired it while on active duty. He should have a CPAP machine but refuses to have one stating, ‚Äú I will not feel suffocated with something on my face while I sleep‚Äù. I totally get it!

2024-05-05,Saved some possible ear damage I guess
2024-05-05,"they‚Äôre better than most concert earplugs, you can still hear everything with a really good sound dynamic, just without destryoing-your-hearing levels of noise"

2024-05-05,"I have mine since december 2022 i bought a plastic protection case for ~10 dollars , they fell once in it and the case cracked inside.The battery life is trash after 1,5 years   and they sound  quieter.
Some how even xiaomi earbuds that I got in 2017 that even fell in water are louder and better battery life."
2024-05-09,Good to know! I‚Äôll pick some up then soon.
2024-05-06,Love the noise cancellation on my XM4s. My go to pair for air travel.
2024-05-06,charging is pretty quick though - using them always on flights up to 13h - they only need to go in the box for charging once i think
2024-05-06,"Is there some trick to the noise cancelling? I have xm4‚Äôs and the APP2 are not comparable in noise cancelling. I can still hear different noises, simple things like moving my have along a desk it sounds like the noise cancel is ‚Äúletting‚Äù that noise through electronically. And yes I have noise cancelling fully turned on but it still happens. When I put the xm4‚Äôs on I‚Äôm completely isolated."
2024-05-06,did you have them charged previously? mine last atleast 5 hours
2024-05-06,I had REALLY bad thumping with the 1s and I don‚Äôt think the audio quality was as good. The thumping while walking was the dealbreaker tho. It was overbearing.
2024-05-05,"Dang, well I can understand that.¬†

I use nasal cpap mask that cover my nose and doesn‚Äôt fee suffacoted but my friend and dad said that they don‚Äôt want to use it for the same reason üòÇ"
2024-05-05,"Tell him sleep apnea causes dementia. And the quality of sleep with a machine is sooo much better. You can get masks that only cover the nose, which helps mitigate the clunkiness."
2024-05-05,"The nasal pillows don‚Äôt suffocate at all, it‚Äôs pretty comfortable tbh‚Ä¶ just get him to get a proper cpap trial, it‚Äôll be worth it"
2024-05-06,"Lol this is exactly the opposite of what the CPAP machine does üòÇ without it = person doesn‚Äôt breathe, with it = person can breathe. 

Well, if it helps anyhow: my wife uses a CPAP mask that is very small, only covers her nose. Maybe showing this helps convincing him to try. 

Also, her sleep improved 1000% after starting using it. Before the CPAP she had constant headaches and always felt tired because she was barely sleeping since the apnea woke her up during the night multiple times (without her noticing)."
2024-05-05,Divorce?
2024-05-06,"Was he diagnosed with minor, moderate, or severe sleep apnea? If it‚Äôs minor, he could use a prescribed sleep apnea mouth guard."
2024-09-12,Sleeep apena is real bad i thought the same until i woke up feeling super refreshed.
2024-05-06,"This is 1000% a good use of their ANC!

I was a huge advocate for standard noise filtering earplugs but with the APP2‚Äôs, it‚Äôs a no brainer"
2024-05-05,I dropped mine without a case about a hundred times and they work perfectly fine.
2024-05-06,Nah
2024-05-06,If the microphone and transparency mode was just as good as APP2 it would be my choice for travel!
2024-05-06,"I‚Äôm not sure, have you accidentally turned on Adaptive instead of Noise Cancellation. 

Have you done the ear tip fit test?

I also use my APP2 in the office when taking meetings when it‚Äôs too loud and cancels everyone around me talking."
2024-05-06,It's probably just me using it before flight
2024-05-06,"Mine which are only 1 day old only lasts 100% to 20% in 2 hours. Mixed use but mostly just ANC on and nothing playing.
Other than all that crazy amount of white noise in the background"
2024-05-06,"I also have this and somehow nobody else does. I've owned the sony WF 1000XM3s and could only use them while sitting still, anything else would overpower what I'm listening to and be extremely uncomfortable while reviews always talk about running with earpods. The app2 are significantly better but I still can't run with them."
2024-11-07,eles preferem ter infarto. n√£o se sentir decansados... faz parte.
2024-05-06,AirPods are cheaperü§£
2024-05-06,"I would be scared to lose them, somehow none of the tips fit perfectly for me and I have to adjust every few minutes to make sure they still sit stable in the ear"
2024-05-06,Yea dude must be smashing his lmfao
2024-05-06,They are?
2024-05-07,They make sports clips for them that loop around your ear so they don‚Äôt pop out as well as they also have neckbands that prevent them from getting lost easily. Definitely worth it for special occasions or if you‚Äôre working in risky areas where you could drop and lose them!
2024-12-13,"Pro 2, better sound quality and anc and the silicone tips with various sizes help to better fit in your ear"
2024-12-13,"Pro 2, trust me it‚Äôs worth the money"
2024-12-13,I hated the way the Pro 2s felt in my ear.  I rarely ever used them.  Recently purchased AirPod 4s with ANC and I am in love with them. Granted the noise cancelling is not as good as the 2s however my ears certainly appreciate the comfort of these over the 2s
2024-12-13,"Pro 2, bought the 4 and returned them."
2024-12-13,"You either like silicone ear tips or you don‚Äôt! 
Me personally I have AirPod three and if I were to buy new ones, I would buy AirPod four with ANC. I can wear them longer and I don‚Äôt feel them in my ears. Wear silicone tips almost feel like over ear headphones and you will get more moisture or discomfort, wearing them long-term"
2024-12-13,"Get the 4. I have both and in my opinion, the 4 is just as good. Plus i find it so much more comfortable than the pro 2. The noise cancelling really surprised me too. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs as good as the pro 2 also."
2024-12-13,I'll give the same answer I always give when someone asks this question. Buy both try them out and return the ones you like less.
2024-12-13,"To me, it 100% came down to how they feel in my ears. I personally do not like the feeling of silicone tips fully in my ear. I feel stuffed and don‚Äôt find it comfortable.

So I upgraded from the AirPods Gen 3 to the Gen 4 with ANC about a month ago. The fit is generally the same, although I sometimes feel the right one is jiggling loose (although neither have ever fallen out). 

I‚Äôm very happy with the ANC. With the previous generations, listening on an airplane was nearly impossible. I didn‚Äôt like it. So I used Sony 1000XM4‚Äôs on flights. But with these, I can comfortably listen to a movie, podcast, or music on a plane. It does great to drown out the loud ‚Äúhum‚Äù. As others have said I‚Äôd say it has 70-80% of the noise canceling you‚Äôd expect from the pro‚Äôs which for me is definitely good enough."
2024-12-13,"AP4 ANC sound quality blew me away, coming from AP2. They fit perfect for me, and ANC is pretty good in a office setting."
2024-12-14,"I have Pro 2, my gf AirPods 4.

The sound is the same, AirPods 4 are big and fall from my ear if do much movement 

Pro 2 noise cancellation is MAGIC, and the volume command is something I love"
2024-12-13,"For me I have the ANC 4 and I love them, the noise canceling isn't overkill but it def enough for school and city use. They have great bass and sound quality. However Silicone tips don't work in my ears so it's a no-brainer for me personally!"
2024-12-13,"4 with anc, if you would rather have no silicone tips"
2024-12-13,I just got the 4 anc and it‚Äôs great. I don‚Äôt know that I would enjoy the way pro 2 would fit in my ear. Kind of sensitive to that thing. Just my two cents.
2024-12-13,"I didn‚Äôt like the silicone tips and it would always fall off my ear when I ran so I went with the 4 now and they feel good
On ears"
2024-12-13,"If the pros two are comfortable for you, they are much better value. That being said I have tried both and the pros two are so uncomfortable to me. Specifically, I do like my AirPods 4 with ANC more simply because they are comfortable for me."
2024-12-13,"I love the 2‚Äôs, the 4‚Äôs don‚Äôt stay in my ear. A lot of people have the opposite experience"
2024-12-14,"If you plan on using ANC while sleeping on your side, then AirPods4. If you don‚Äôt have this exact reason, then get AirPods Pro 2"
2024-12-14,Pro 2.
2024-12-14,Personally I like both styles but the pro 2 is more for your money and will have more/better working features.. depends on what you want tho.. do you want a silicone ear piece in your ear or do you want to sacrifice sound quality to be rid of that experience?? Do you like noise cancelling and auto detect conversation and such working at its best?? If so pro 2‚Ä¶ do you not care about those things and just want something that won‚Äôt fall out your ears easy and don‚Äôt want to spend pro2 money??? If so the 4s (keep in mind idek the price difference anymore so it‚Äôs really just what you personally like and want feature wise.. for a starter I‚Äôd go with the pro 2s just to have a better sound quality experience and get the 4s or any other gen of those AirPods later on when you don‚Äôt want to deal with the ear piece actually plugging your ear with silicone and then switch between the 2
2024-12-15,"The AirPods Pros 2 are so much better in every way sound quality, Comfort, style, tracking for the case including the AirPods"
2024-12-15,"The Pro 2 might just be the best tech purchase I've ever made, period. Worth every penny."
2024-12-15,"i don‚Äôt understand why everyone is just saying pros 2, it completely depends on if you like hard tip earbuds or soft tip. the airpods 4 are great for me because i‚Äôve never liked the way the pros fit in my ears with the silicone"
2024-12-15,4 is trash. Go for the 2.
2024-12-15,"i can‚Äôt do the silicone ear buds. they always pop out. my 2‚Äôs have stayed in my ear through some fuckin wild shit, including tumbling down a mountain on skis at 35mph while tearing my ACL."
2024-12-13,APP2!
2024-12-13,Pro 2. Watched a movie on a flight. I legit thought I had surround sound
2024-12-13,"I‚Äôve been stuck debating this exact thing for at least the last 2/3 weeks‚Ä¶

Yesterday I came home with Pro 2‚Äôs, I can‚Äôt say which is better as I‚Äôve never experienced 4‚Äôs but I have zero regrets for these pro‚Äôs. 

Same price as the 4‚Äôs/ANC but with more features, it‚Äôs a no brainer really."
2024-12-13,Pro 2 for sure
2024-12-14,I have pro 2 and it‚Äôs the best tech I own
2024-12-14,Pro 2‚Äôs. The only reason I‚Äôd ever recommend regular AirPods over the Pro‚Äôs is if you just can‚Äôt stand your ears sealed with the silicone tips. It bothers some people. I think the silicone is way more comfortable than just plastic in my ear like the regular ones but to each their own. If you don‚Äôt like the tips on the Pros there are tons of aftermarket options that are made from different materials. The ANC on the Pro‚Äôs is amazing.
2024-12-14,Buy the pro 2
2024-12-14,AirPod pros 2 ofcourse there amazing!! The surround sound and noise cancellation work really good
2024-12-13,Airpods 4 with Anc is awesome. I tried pro 2 but the bass and woofers hits different on 4 with Anc
2024-12-13,Yes.
2024-12-13,"The ANC on the 4s is not that strong, when I am on the bus I can still understand half of the stuff the annoying kids are screaming about"
2024-12-13,"You‚Äôre comparing AirPods Gen4 with AirPods PRO Gen2.

The initial all plastic AirPods are on their 4th gen just released, the AirPods Pro are the silicon tips and had a first gen and are still on their 2nd gen since September 2022.

The Pro‚Äôs with the silicon tips have the haptic stem. The Pro 2s you can raise/lower volume with the haptic stem. The regular 4s I think still use tapping the side which would kind of irritate my ears before I had the Pros. 

The Pros are the higher end line and the Pro 2s are nice headphones. I just upgraded from Pro‚Äôs to Pro 2s and I‚Äôm happy. I prefer the silicon over the hard pod."
2024-12-13,Doesn't apple still sell single replacements for pro 2s?
2024-12-13,I just upgraded from gen 3 to Pro 2 Thanksgiving week. I was skeptical before I made the purchase because I don't really like snug fit in ear headphones w/ silicone tips. After I get used to the feeling of having them in I cant tell I even have them in. All the features work great for how I use them too so I'd highly recommend giving the Pro 2s a shot.
2024-12-13,Depends really if you will like the ear tips I have the pros but I prefer not using the tips so I still use my AirPods gen2 over the pros just for comfort I might upgrade those to gen4
2024-12-13,"I‚Äôve never tried the pod 4 but it‚Äôs been roughly 2 years and my pros have almost completely bit the dust. The case holds very little charge, and the pods themselves have lost a lot of their good sound quality (heavy bass? Forget it.) Maybe it‚Äôs wrong to be disappointed, I just didn‚Äôt expect something so expensive to not last longer when handled with care.


I don‚Äôt know if this alters your decision, especially since I don‚Äôt know the life expectancy of the 4, but it feels wrong for me to order another pair of Pros knowing that I‚Äôm paying the same amount I did years ago."
2024-12-13,"Some ppl have the 4 fit better. For some the Pro 2 fit better. You have to try it for yourself.

Buy the one that fits your ear well, and if both fit equally well, get the Pro 2."
2024-12-13,I have pro 2 and airpods 4 on the way. Got Pro 2 on amazon for 120$ on sale. Well worth the money
2024-12-13,"I‚Äôn holding out for the Pro 3rd Gen, hopefully later in 2025. My 1st Gen Pro‚Äôs are awful now, bass has blown, any track with a hint of reverb sounds like it‚Äôs being played on vinyl down a phone line in the 50s."
2024-12-13,Bought the 4 pro since I didn't want in ear. Returned it and got the pro 2 for the extra hour of battery life and like it more. The tips don't bother me as much as I expected and I can still hear my surroundings.
2024-12-13,Any major difference between gen 1 and gen2 pro 2s?  Is it worth the extra money for the gen 2?
2024-12-13,One of my friends just got the 4 and exchanged their pro 2 and they said that they regretted it. I forgot the reasons but all I know is that they wanted their pro 2 back and wanted to return the 4 üò≠
2024-12-13,Noise cancellation will mess up eventually
2024-12-13,Wearing headphones with silicon tips makes me my ears hurt because of the air pressure lol. It‚Äôs such a weird feeling. So I like the AirPods 4s with ANC.
2024-12-13,"it‚Äôs what I‚Äôll get from santa until two more weeks., on christmas night -hannah. with the phone it plugs."
2024-12-13,Completely different fit
2024-12-13,I can‚Äôt stand silicone in my ear so I went with the 4 ANC. The noise canceling is extremely impressive and on par with some seal type I have.
2024-12-13,"Two different products for two different uses. 

Do you need full anc and want to be able to block out the world? Then pro

Do you prefer not to have that stuffy feeling of something in your ear and just want to silence light sounds and dim the rest on occasion but still be able to keep them in and talk without turning on pass through mode then pods 4.

I generally prefer the open style for day to day but use pro for flying."
2024-12-13,"I have both and prefer AirPods 4, much more comfortable to my ears, didn‚Äôt fall any single time while the pro 2 keeps falling, no matter the size of tips (I tried all the sizes). If you have big ears AirPods 4 will fit better"
2024-12-13,4 is basically the pro 2 but without silicone tips so id say its just up to if you want to save some money
2024-12-13,"I went from Pro1‚Äôs to 4 ANC and I found the 4‚Äôs more comfortable and better ANC than the Pro1‚Äôs I didn‚Äôt upgrade to Pro2‚Äôs because of uncomfortable silicone tips, but if you don‚Äôt care about silicone tips you should be fine"
2024-12-13,"I have both.  I prefer the 4's for comfort.  That said, there is better sound out of the Pro 2's, but after a while, the silicone in the ear annoys me."
2024-12-13,"I took the 4 and totally love them, ANC was crazy when I tried it outside.

I dont know why people here saying they dont stay in ears lol. I already tried and cant stand the feeling of the intra-tips."
2024-12-13,Buy the 4s with ANC and just return them if you don‚Äôt like them
2024-12-13,"I got the pros and they kept falling out. Even tried all different sizes. Got to the stage where Apple wouldn‚Äôt accept the return because they got damaged as a result. 

I ended up buying Powerbeats Pro (apple product) that clip around the ear."
2024-12-13,"Pro 2‚Äôs ANC is so bad you can‚Äôt tell it‚Äôs even on, you‚Äôll be constantly checking if it‚Äôs actually in pass through mode as you can hear everything around you perfectly clearly. 

So I would say do not buy them whatsoever. Any good reviews you see about ANC were before they removed it with an update."
2024-12-13,"I have both.  The 4s fit my ear better, so they are my daily use pair.  The Pro 2s have pretty much been relegated to airplane use, because the noise cancelling is better (though the 4s are better than I thought they'd be there)."
2024-12-14,I swear this question gets asked. Every. Single. Day.
2024-12-14,"I have both. AirPods 4 is small for my ears and honestly noise canceling is non-existent, sometimes I cannot even understand if active or not.

Get the AirPods Pro."
2024-12-14,Just bought the 4s yesterday and I‚Äôm returning it cause it keeps slipping out of my ears üò≠
2024-12-14,"You know you can get a replacement from Apple, right?

I think theyre like $60"
2024-12-14,"Depends what you want. Do you want the best there is, or do you want a slightly ‚Äòlighter‚Äô experience"
2024-12-14,which pair has the features you want the most? Buy those ones.
2024-12-14,"I have Pro 1st gen and yesterday bought Airpods 4 with ANC. I would return it and get the Pro 2. 

4 is just too light for my liking"
2024-12-14,"I have the 1st gen pros and the 4(ANC). I like the 4s better but the pros never really fit my ears well even with the different size silicone tips. I‚Äôve always liked no tips better anyway. This is personal experience. And don‚Äôt be fooled by the 4s not having silicone tips‚Ä¶the anc works extremely well without it. I mow my yard every week with them using a gas mower, and I can still hear the motor, but it drowns it out very well."
2024-12-14,AirPods 4. Silicone tip is just uncomfortable and I‚Äôd rather hear my surroundings a bit
2024-12-14,Wait for Pro 3
2024-12-14,"AirPods 4, I don‚Äôt like the rubber tips, in particular when I only wear one of two"
2024-12-14,"the airpod knockoffs on amazon for $30. work beautifully, and if you lose one you dont have to go spend $200 again."
2024-12-14,"Do you want stereo sound? Do you like old rock classics? Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, the Beatles? I‚Äôm so pissed. I had a 12 with AirPods 3 no stereo. My AirPods 3 have stereo on my iPad mini 6 with all music services. 

My wife is rolling on a 13 with my old AirPods 1 SHE HAS STEREO. I can‚Äôt stand the way pros feel in my ear.

So finally I upgraded to iPhone 16 with AirPods 4 and a free trial to Apple Music. 
Listened to Dark Side of the Moon with Apple Music De Dolby Atmos ‚Ä¢ Al Hi-Res Lossless‚Ä¶WTF NO STEREO!!!  I‚Äôm so pissed their flagship phone with their latest AirPods and no stereo. They are intentionally crippling their device on their own music player. Rant over. ***steps off soapbox***"
2024-12-14,The 4s. These silicon tips are not worth any kind of sound quality. Simplify awful.
2024-12-14,2‚Äôs
2024-12-14,Pro 2 if you‚Äôre comfortable with silicone or AirPods Gen 4 ANC
2024-12-14,Costco has the 2 pro for 200 dollars and comes with 2 years apple care for free.
2024-12-14,"I‚Äôd go with the Pro 2, I didn‚Äôt even know about them until I got them for Xmas the other year, I was surprised by how they felt and sounded! 

It‚Äôs worth the extra money. ü§© I love the NC option and the transparency options üëçüèº"
2024-12-14,"Depends on whether or not you like the silicone tips. I find them much more comfortable than the plastic, so I‚Äôd say Pro 2."
2024-12-14,Pro 2 since they are better and almost always on sale  for less than $180
2024-12-14,Could‚Äôve got the Pros for $160. Trades in my old ones and got another $35 off
2024-12-14,Go try them on. Whichever fit your ears best is the one.
2024-12-14,Bellsprout or angry alien. Simple choice.
2024-12-14,4
2024-12-14,Definitely the Pros. Amazon has them on sale for the holidays so now‚Äôs a good time to get them.
2024-12-14,"APP2, _definitely_. MSRP sucks but at sale price it's a way better deal."
2024-12-14,i got both. airpods 4 i use out and about/work and pros 2 i use in my own time or to sleep. pros 2 probably more quality but the 4s with ANC are valid
2024-12-14,I went for pro 2 on Black Friday
2024-12-14,Pro 2 they are also about the same price as the AirPod 4 ANC right now
2024-12-14,I love my PRO 2
2024-12-14,"I have both and after 2 years of using the Pro 2 I‚Äôm liking the AirPods 4 with ANC more and more each day, sound quality sounds the same to me and the ANC works really good. I find them more comfortable after a couple of hours of use. The only thing I miss is the slide to adjust volume feature."
2024-12-14,"Go with the 4's if you don't like the rubber tips, go with the Pro 2's if you like the rubber tips."
2024-12-14,Pro 2!!! FTW
2024-12-14,"I personally chose the AirPods 4 with ANC.

I used a pair of 1st-gen AirPods Pro before this. Even though the ANC was great, I didn‚Äôt like having to use the silicone tips because they were uncomfortable in my ears.

I can tolerate the AirPods 4 with ANC much more. The ANC is extremely impressive given that the earbuds don‚Äôt have silicone tips. Adaptive mode (combines Transparency and ANC) works amazingly, especially when combined with Conversation Awareness on. I don‚Äôt have to take off my headphones just to talk to someone or hear what‚Äôs going on around me. The audio quality is great for what I need.

I don‚Äôt need the extra perks that come with the AirPods Pro 2."
2024-12-14,Pro 2
2024-12-14,Depends on what you like - I have the pros with the comply foam tips and I‚Äôll never use anything else. My husband hates anything in-ear so he has the AirPods 4 and loves them.
2024-12-14,Pro 2s if u have money
2024-12-14,Wait for new version
2024-12-14,i‚Äôve had both. the pros 2 are much more comfortable. the ones on the left would hurt my ears.
2024-12-14,"Used the 4s for a week, fit horribly, haven't tried the Pro 2s but they're guaranteed to fit in any ear well."
2024-12-14,Combine them AirPod 6
2024-12-14,Pro 2 and buy comply foam tips.
2024-12-14,AirPods Pro Max. Best Buy has the lightning version on sale right now
2024-12-14,"Both are good - if you like the format of regular AirPods more than pro go with 4 - if you like pro format go with pros. 

To be honest even with 4s being newer the chip being used is the same so it‚Äôs not like the AirPod pro 2s are old they use both the same tech"
2024-12-14,none of these. So cheap on hardware.
2024-12-14,Pro 2... ofcourse
2024-12-14,"Neither, basic pods at Walmart sound better."
2024-12-14,"Have both , pro 2 is good in terms of sound and ANC. 4 is compact , no tips , okayish ANC if you get the ANC version ."
2024-12-14,I got the AirPod 4s upgrading from Gen 2 AirPods. And I love them. I‚Äôve tried my girlfriends pro 2s I don‚Äôt like how they fit and fall out of my ears
2024-12-14,"depends on what ur looking for! (i hate to be that person so imma make it rlly easy)

the most important:

do you want rubber tips?

if earbuds tend to fall out of your ear a lot, id go with the pro 2 since the silicone/rubber tip goes into your ear and prevents sliding. the airpods 4 are better shaped than the 1st gen airpods and they sit more comofortably in your ear but they can fall out if you're someone like me

i recommned the pro 2's:

i've had the gen 1 pros for like 3 years and i love them, batterys pretty decent, sound quality is great, noise cancellation is pristine, transparency mode is crisp, etc

  
also, the airpods 4 r more prone to getting dirty from earwax since nothing is protecting them, my airpods pro r super clean and i never clean them properly. not a single bit of earwax has obstructed the speaker"
2024-12-14,AirPods 4 didn‚Äôt fit well in my ears. It‚Äôs bigger than the original AirPods. I went with AirPods Pro 2 instead and have no regrets. The sound quality is really good in pro model.
2024-12-14,"Pro 2, for $150 it‚Äôs not even close"
2024-12-14,"Just got my Pro 2‚Äôs delivered yesterday after buying them on Amazon during Black Friday. For what it can do, I‚Äôd say get them. The silicone ear tips weren‚Äôt the best so I got a set of memory foam tips off Amazon that work great. üëç"
2024-12-14,"The AirPods 4 looks incredibly similar to the 3rd gen AirPods.. and let me tell you that was the worst purchase of my life. The 4th and 3rd look like they have the same shape in this photo, the 3rd gen‚Äôs would not stay in my ear for shit, fucking fly out of my ear, so unless you have enough earwax to act as an adhesive to the airpod then I highly reccomend you opt for the AirPods Pro 2.  Not to mention since the airpod fit so goddamn horribly in my ear, the sound quality was like I was listening to the music from the inside of a microwave. So I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this was also be the case for the 4‚Äôs, and all the whatever new fancy qualities it offers, they‚Äôre probably also compromised due to just how poorly they are designed. Those AirPods really pissed me the fuck off, and I bought em back when they were 200 something dollars.. never returned something faster. GET THE AIRPODS PRO 2 WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!!!"
2024-12-14,I prefer the AirPods 4 since I hate the silicon tip kind.
2024-12-14,"AirPod Pro 2‚Äôs have stem volume control, AirPod 4‚Äôs don‚Äôt (I learnt this the hard way) if it matters to you. I preferred the 2 Pros"
2024-12-14,Pro 2 is the best
2024-12-14,Pro
2024-12-14,Question as old as time. Prooooos before hooooes duuuuude
2024-12-14,"Buy either model, but sure you get the AirPods 4 with ANC."
2024-12-14,It‚Äôs one of those times when the price difference is not even that huge while the quality is absolutely on another level for all aspects there are so go with pro 2‚Äôs
2024-12-14,"I chose AirPods 4 ANC, not the price problem, but I went to an Apple Store and tried them both out.  

Both sounded amazing, but I hated the feeling of the earbuds in my ear canal.

I recommend trying them both out, and if you don‚Äôt mind the earbuds then get the AirPods Pro 2"
2024-12-14,"bought the pros 2 recently and they are amazing, have had the pros 1 since released and always liked them, but at this point they are a bit old and due for an upgrade so i got the pros 2 when i bought my new 16 pro max and they are insane, they‚Äôre so comfortable compared to the normal airpods imo and honestly, the ANC is actually kinda ridiculous, i was at a race track and wanted to zone out for a little when i was eating, so i put them in thinking they would get rid of a little noise, and i genuinely took them out again to see if there was a crash and the racing had stopped because of how good the ANC is, i literally couldn‚Äôt hear a thing. i‚Äôm not usually one to harp on about the quality of products but the pros 2 are actually insanely good, i can‚Äôt speak on the longevity but the sound quality, ANC and comfortability make these perfect for me"
2024-12-14,Go for pro 2. I promise you. Huge huge difference
2024-12-14,"Noise cancellation works best with a complete seal of your ears, (whether as in-ear silicone plugs or full over-ear cans for example).
You want the best that apple offers? Go Pro2.

AirPods 4 don‚Äôt have silicone tips, and being an ear bud without a full seal, means noise cancellation won‚Äôt be as good. 
The side effect of this is you‚Äôll hear more of the outside world while using them.

Why is this a good thing?
Some people are allergic to silicone, or find that the full seal is uncomfortable or irritating to be able to use the Pro2s for long.

So,
for most, go Pro2.
For those that take exception to silicone, go Pod4."
2024-12-14,Mods can we just pin this thread?
2024-12-14,What airpods 4 you want to buy? With noise cancellation or without?
2024-12-14,AirPods 4
2024-12-14,Definitely the Pro 2s
2024-12-14,The Pro 2 if you want the better sound quality
2024-12-14,"Pro 2 were cheaper ($153) than AirPods 4 anc on Black Friday, double whammy worth it"
2024-12-14,Anytime it‚Äôs AirPods Pro 2!!!
2024-12-14,"If you don‚Äôt like the gel tips like me, get the 4‚Äôs. I‚Äôve been using gen 2‚Äôs for years and these made me finally get an upgrade"
2024-12-14,"I‚Äôve tried both, and for me, the AirPods Pro 2 just feel better with the fit and sound quality, especially with the silicone tips. The AirPods 4 are not bad..but if you‚Äôre used to the Pro 2, you might miss that comfy fit."
2024-12-14,I have the AP 4 with ANC and they work amazing for me. Driving my moped with noise cancelling on i couldn‚Äôt even hear the engine under me while revving. They also fit really good in my ears and have never fallen out and i‚Äôve been using them for like 3 months. I really like them but can‚Äôt speak much about the APP2s
2024-12-14,You like in ear or not? That‚Äôs basically what the big deciding factor is when it comes to the pro.
2024-12-14,"Had the Pro 2 until I‚Äôve lost them. Went desperately to the store to buy a new pair and the clerk told me to buy the new Airpods 4 which are better. I listened to him and regretted it very deeply. Couldn‚Äôt return it because of Apple policy because I opened it. 


Buy the Pro 4."
2024-12-14,Pro2
2024-12-14,Wait 4 months and get AirPods Pro 3?
2024-12-14,Why don‚Äôt they just make one model with the silicone tips? The regular ones without the tips are useless.
2024-12-14,I have AP3 and went APP2 over the AP4 with NC when the Pro were ¬£179 on sale.
2024-12-14,"Pro 2, definitely. Or wait a year for the pro 3"
2024-12-14,"I think the most important distinction for this choice is how they fit. I would say AP4s because in ear headphones are super uncomfortable to me and any long use will make me feel like I need to get my ears clean. Plus I can never get them in any size tip to fit snugly in my ear without a hook. 

The regular AirPods have never had an issue with fit or staying in for me. The thing is that everyone‚Äôs ears are different, and the fit of your headphones will actually even have a big effect on the way they sound. 

If you have an Apple Store anywhere that you can get to, I would highly recommend you go and try them out in store before buying either pair. Yes they have a bunch of pairs of all three models that are for trying out, and yes they are very well and thoroughly cleaned."
2024-12-14,You can get 3rd party tips for the AirPod 4s.  I‚Äôm thinking of trying some‚Ä¶
2024-12-14,"Get the pros, but also buy a warranty and exchange them for a gift card right before it expires. Tell them the battery is degraded. Which it will be. Works every time. New pair every 2 years. Idk why more people dont do this. Warranties make money off people forgetting about them."
2024-12-14,"I find the not-Pros fall out of my ears all the time, and I can never get a good seal.

IMO, if you are fine with the silicone tips, that's your answer; pro by default, unless you don't like silicone."
2024-12-14,I have the pros 2 they are the best decision I‚Äôve ever made the noise cancellation and sound quality are just one of the many great things they come with they also charge fast have more battery life and better ways to track them when you lose them.
2024-12-14,4th Gen ANC
2024-12-14,"Just wait for the pros 3, they coming out soon"
2024-12-14,"I would say wait till the next AirPods Pro, which are AirPods Pro three or even bypassed them altogether and get its phones and devices that are using nearer Link, which is way way better than any Bluetooth device"
2024-12-14,Pro 2 still more advanced
2024-12-14,"Pro 2

Much much better in every way and it‚Äôs been on a great sale!"
2024-12-14,Pro2 - great sound and they don‚Äôt fall out of your ears like the AirPod 4‚Äôs did for me. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.
2024-12-14,Pro 2 trust me bro
2024-12-14,Pro 2 for SUUUURE. No other AirPods can compare.
2024-12-14,"If you like silicone tips, there‚Äôs no reason to consider the 4. If you dislike themd, the 4 are comfortable, has good ANC and great sound."
2024-12-14,Neither Get the Beats Fit Pros.
2024-12-14,"Just to share my experience, I have both because the AP4 are much more comfortable to me while sounding great and have good ANC.

When I go out I take the APP2 because the ANC is superior and for the loud noise reduction feature.

If I could only have one I would choose APP2 because when I need those features I really need them, but it‚Äôs very nice to have the AP4 for around the house and in the home office. I use them both enough to justify it but others may not."
2024-12-14,"I'd recommend just getting the AirPods Pro 2 for various reasons. I've never really liked the larger charging case of the Pros and usually preferred the simpler look of regular AirPods but recently have found the ANC (mainly for work and commute) to be pretty effective. I also find that the tips with the Pros make it so that they don't fall out of the ear as easily and actually make it easier to simply clean with a Q-tip as the Airpods themselves aren't making direct contact with your ears.

I also have been using a pair of fully functional Airpods 2nd Gen that I purchased years ago for $89.99 which have served me well through undergrad and beyond. I find regular AirPods in general to be slightly more comfortable, not by a significant margin, at the cost of slightly more difficult cleaning and falling out more often.

For a slightly higher price, I think that they're worth the investment in the long run. I got my Pro 2s from Costco on sale for $179.99 a few weeks ago with about 51 months of AppleCare included."
2024-12-14,short answer: definitely pro 2
2024-12-14,"Personally, I like the AirPods Pro 2. The AirPods 4 were designed for people who didn‚Äôt like the pro two because of the silicone. I absolutely think the silicone makes them fit much better and I would not buy the AirPods 4 specifically for that reason for me. The good thing about the AP4 is that it has the same exact chipset as the APP2 and same features so you‚Äôre not giving up anything in that respect."
2024-12-14,Pro 2. I just returned my AirPods 4
2024-12-14,"Just got the APP2 today since my older pro ones were dying, absolute blast experiencing good ANC again and the icing on the cake for me was the conversational awareness feature, literally so intuitive. Go for the Pro2, you‚Äôll love the volume controls, too!"
2024-12-14,I have heard the Pro 2‚Äôa are AMAZING
2024-12-14,Whichever is more comfortable for you. I like the open ear design for comfort but silicone (comply foam) for better sound and noise protection on my jobsite
2024-12-14,"I loved the originals but those were discontinued with the releases of the 4‚Äôs & were the only ones from Apple that felt good in my ears.  

I feel like they were the most popular - I wonder why Apple killed them off?"
2024-12-14,Pro 2 are so godly
2024-12-14,I have the standard earbuds that come with the iPhone and they suck. They hurt my ears a lot. Planning on going for the 2s simply for the silicone tip and ANC.
2024-12-14,"Pros 2, I've had a pair since 2022, they've been through war, and they still work marvelously. Battery ain't the same of course, but still last a good almost full 3 hours with ANC on. And still charges very fast in the case. And once they die I'll just buy a new pair, or maybe wait for air pods pro 3."
2024-12-14,I got the 4‚Äôs because I absolutely hate the way those little rubber things feel on the pro 2‚Äôs
2024-12-14,Neither
2024-12-14,My Pro 2s started squeeking after I slept on it. They also now squeek when i turn noise cancellation on
2024-12-15,Both are amazing
2024-12-15,Basically the same just without the silicone tips lol
2024-12-15,Max üòÉ
2024-12-15,"I prefer the Pro 2s, but I can never get the regular airpods to rest in my ears well..."
2024-12-15,"I recently got the AirPods Pro 2. I believe they are more expensive, but they are really very good. Just be aware that you need iOS 17 or later to support their full functionality. I found out the hard way that my iPhone8 was too old to be properly compatible with my new AirPods, because the older phone doesn‚Äôt support iOS 17 or later, apparently. I‚Äôm sure the vast majority of people who decide to get the super cool and expensive AirPods Pro 2 will have fairly new iPhone models, so won‚Äôt have this problem that I‚Äôve had. I‚Äôve had to get a new iPhone just so I can enjoy the full range of groovy features on my new headphones."
2024-12-15,"I love my airpods pro 2 tbh it‚Äôs not that different from the og ones but noise cancelling is soo good on them by a landslide.. 

if you‚Äôre sensitive/don‚Äôt like the feeling/ or are allergic to the silicone tips maybe get the airpods4
but otherwise, airpods pro 2 are the way to go"
2024-12-15,"definitely airpods 4, pro 2 falls out way too easy due to silicone tips"
2024-12-15,"Pro 2. It may be the best purchase I‚Äôve ever made. The quality is incredible. The build quality is incredible too: I literally had my AirPods Pro 2s in my pants pockets in the wash AND dryer, and they worked fine when I got them out. Unreal."
2024-12-15,P2 if they fit your ears and if not stick to the 4s
2024-12-15,Pro 2's by far.
2024-12-15,"Just get pro 2 dude, the sound quality and ANC with the eartips can‚Äôt be beaten by airpods 4"
2024-12-15,"If you still have the charging case and one of your airpods, you can go to the Apple store and get a replacement for the missing earpod cheaper than either of these options."
2024-12-15,Pro 2 is immediately better
2024-12-15,AirPods Pro 2
2024-12-15,Take the pro 2 it has better sound quality and comes with better noise control
2024-12-15,Honestly ever since I‚Äôve gotten the AP2 my ears have been so waxy but like a watery waxy feeling. I never had this problem with any other headphones even the OG AP
2024-12-15,"Everyone says Pro 2 is bang for buck
4 has less features even though they are newer and hence less price tag.

Pro 2 is a successful model, so Apple did not make any SKU that outperforms it.

I was an avid user of Gen2 Airpods, just 2 days ago bought the Pro 2 myself.

Worth it."
2024-12-15,4 cuz theyre 2x better than the 2s /s
2024-12-15,"Take 4s only if you have problems with silicone tips, I hate those, and I am pretty satisfied with 4s, but 4s are inferior in many ways, including sound quality."
2024-12-15,"Pro 2 Are better than 4, if you are already used to it better stay with it üëç"
2024-12-15,Pro 2 the 4s are budget while the pro 2 are more studio quality. I have had every AirPods besides the 4s and have definitely preferred the pro 2s
2024-12-15,"Pro2 will fuck your audition, ear canals need to breath so 4s are a better choice."
2024-12-15,"I have the pro 2s and oh my god I don‚Äôt think the AirPod 4s can come even close to the quality of sound, the features and the silicone tip comfort that the pro 2s have, I‚Äôd say go for the pro 2s"
2024-12-15,Personally I hate the clogged feeling of silicone tip earbuds. I'll take the non silicone ones all day.
2024-12-15,"Tips or no tips, that answers your question."
2024-12-15,Pros all the way
2024-12-15,AirPod 4 with ANC are really great. I was skeptical at first but like them a lot.
2024-12-15,"im a big fan of my airpods pro 2, silicone tips never fit my ears right so i opted for memory foam tips from amazon! way better fitted"
2024-12-15,Always pro
2024-12-15,"Once you use pro, I don‚Äôt think you can go back. I started with AirPods Gen 2 and shifted to pro 1 and now pro 2"
2024-12-15,"I know you‚Äôre asking about AirPod 4 vs pro2
But it reads like you lost one AirPod pro 2 bud and are now considering buying a whole new set. 
You can (or used to be able) to get a replacement for a single bud.  So just go get that replaced."
2024-12-15,"Pro 2. Although I don‚Äôt like how when you use only one of them, the noise control is always set to transparency. The pro 1 you could use only one and set noise control to off. You can‚Äôt do that with pro 2s"
2024-12-15,"It all depends if you like the tips or not, you won't be able to tell the difference in sound while wearing them regularly."
2024-12-15,Pro 2 is the bestüëåüèªüë¥üèº
2024-12-15,No
2024-12-15,"I have both, the 4's ANC is decent - surprising given the lack of silicone tips, but the Pro 2's ANC is miles ahead, with better sound quality as well (possibly due to the seal it creates.)"
2024-12-15,PRO 2
2024-12-15,"I personally HATE AirPods Pro‚Äôs.  They have great sound but they refuse to stay in my ears.  I‚Äôve tried all the tips that come with them and even bought several different 3rd party tips, and never with any luck. 

My AirPod Pros are essentially backup AirPods should my AirPod 3 or AirPod 4‚Äôs run out of battery."
2024-12-15,Pro is better sound quality but they always hurt my ears so I stopped using them. In hindsight I‚Äôd get the 4‚Äôs.
2024-12-15,"I got the AP4 because the silicone tips fall out of my ears almost immediately. The seal on the AP4 isn‚Äôt great, but it was a great upgrade from my first gen ones. If you know silicone tips work with your ears, just go for those"
2024-12-15,"Not sure if anyone else commented about this but if you lost one of your airpods pro 2, cant you just get a replacement?"
2024-12-16,"Just got mine from Walmart because Amazon was sold out, temporarily. $154 plus tax.  Amazon currently has them for 179, which is still fair.  I deliberated between the pro 2 and the 4 since I e always liked the fit of AirPods 2 ‚Ä¶was concerned about in-ear comfort, but they‚Äôre great. Better noise cancelling, I can use wireless charging ( currently using my watch charger), and it has that neat hearing test ‚Äî my hearing is pretty good so there were only minimal adjustments, but I thought it was interesting. Only think I had to get used to was to turn off noise cancelling if on the phone ‚Äî it sounds weird when I‚Äôm speaking if I don‚Äôt.  I‚Äôm quite pleased with the sound quality, fit, and noise suppression. I‚Äôm wearing them near but not into the ear canal and they haven‚Äôt fallen out. If you font need them right away you might want to wait until after Christmas when prices may blip back down."
2024-12-16,"The AirPods 4 with anc are almost as expensive as the pro 2 on sale, so I‚Äôd say just go with the pro 2 when you find a good price."
2024-12-16,I have both the noise canceling is better on the pros but the fit is better of the 4s.
2024-12-16,"The AirPods Pro because they‚Äôll stay in your ear better and more securely. 
Regular AirPods and the wired ones slide out so easily."
2024-12-16,Which is cheaper?
2024-12-16,"Neither, buy OnePlus buds 3 (or 3 pro if you wanna splurge) and be happier. (Semi) Kidding aside, except fir the rare cases if not tolerating the silicone tips, pro are muchly better than regular"
2024-12-16,AirPods Pro 2 I have had all 3 versions original AirPods Pro AirPods Pro 2 lighting now AirPods Pro 2 usb-c
2024-12-16,Sony and airpods ste the best for me. Linkbuds are my fav
2024-12-16,"Pro 2, it‚Äôs night and day."
2024-12-16,Airpods pro 2. Get them at costco if possible. It‚Äôs like $200
2024-12-16,if you bring your original Pro 2‚Äôs case and remaining pod you can buy the missing pod instead of a whole new set.
2024-12-16,airpods 4 without noise cancellation $129 with noise cancellation it‚Äôs $179 then airpods 2 has the noise cancellation n ear tips but can also track them idk ab that airpod 4s
2024-12-16,"I see people suggesting Pro. I have both and use them for different cases. 
AirPods pro2: commuting, listening music as it‚Äôs the best in ANC and sound quality. 
AirPods 4: watching movies and taking calls as the mic is upgraded as wearing buds for longer time cause ear pain and creates room for bacterial growth. AirPods 4 without buds just sits nicely in your ear and you can wear it for longer duration."
2024-12-16,"ooou, i love this question. i recently just bought air pod pros 2 as an upgrade from the 1st gen and yes the original pairüòè. but before purchase i debated the airpods 4 and as a now owner of pros i wish i got the 4. the rubber tip on the pros suck (personally) they slip easily and attract lint. the active cancellation doesn‚Äôt work as good as i thought given my environments. and i‚Äôm not sure if its just my pair of pros but they‚Äôre not as loud as my 1st gen and more bass heavy sounds sound odd."
2024-12-16,I‚Äôm on team 4s they just fit in my ear better.
2024-12-16,Got my pro 2‚Äôs 2 days ago best purchase yet Noise cancellation should be illegal!
2024-12-16,"Get Status audio instead 
More speakers, actual longevity and much better price"
2024-12-16,I love my Pros and won‚Äôt go back to the other version.
2024-12-17,"I just lost one of my AirPod 2 pros on the subway, will be replacing immediately can't live without these things. Even if new ones come out next month living without these things for a day is a nightmare. Can't workout without it, I could if the gym didn't play their own shitty music and it was silent but not listening to this shitty new age rap trap bs. This will be my...3rd set of airpod pro 2's lol"
2024-12-17,"Well, one fits in any ear, the other doesn‚Äôt."
2024-12-17,I have both and honestly it comes down to how you like the fit and feel.
2024-12-17,Pro2. AirPod drops out of your ears
2024-12-17,"If you like silicon, APPro
If not AP4"
2024-12-17,The pros with the silicone tips do not stay in my ear other than that they are better overall
2024-12-17,"Neither. 
Get the Apple EarPods 2. They have tap to pause/next/rewind, etc. 
Everything after that, you have to press to pause/next etc. 
Sound quality still good"
2024-12-17,App2
2024-12-17,"Buy them off of Temu or like AliExpress, I got a pair for 30¬¢ and for 30¬¢ they sound pretty dang good"
2024-12-17,AirPods Pro 2 are in sale again today for 189.99 at Target
2024-12-17,in ear buds work best for me. so i bought the pros. they are just absolutely incredible. got them for 180¬£ on a black friday deal.
2024-12-17,"Despite being more expensive, the AirPods Pro 2 will be better value because the ANC is way better and plus I like the volume controls on the pro 2‚Äôs"
2024-12-17,Get the beats pro earbuds. Same Apple chip as the AirPods Pro and better sound quality/bass.
2024-12-17,You should go to an Apple Store and check if the AirPods 4 fit your ears
2024-12-17,Pro 2 for sure!
2024-12-17,Pro 2 every day. Apples aced the quality and performance
2024-12-17,if the silicone eartips fit get the pros
2024-12-17,Idk man I heard good things about AirPods 4 with noise cancellation of course. That‚Äôs coming from AirPods Pro 2 user
2024-12-17,Pro 2 all day
2024-12-18,I got the pros because they actually seal the ear off. They also have more features
2024-12-19,I've been wondering the same recently. I found that on amazon there is a good side by side comparison that shows you where the Pro 2 is better
2024-12-20,I use AirPods 4 (but I think pros are better)
2024-12-30,If it hasn‚Äôt been to late. I recommend the Pros. The 4 are good but man do these earphones fall off my ears
2025-01-05,"I‚Äôve had the 4s since a little before Christmas (a gift from my bf) here‚Äôs my opinion as someone who came from pro 2s 
The 2s did fit my ear better. The 4s have some connectivity issues as well as the noise cancellation isn‚Äôt that great imo. I work in a loud environment and even with the adjustments it‚Äôs difficult to hear my music. I feel like the volume can‚Äôt go up as high as the 2s. The conversation adapter just turns off the music entirely whereas I felt the 2 just lowered the volume. There are some pros when I‚Äôm not in a super loud environment and I‚Äôm using Apple Music instead of Spotify the sound is amazing. I feel like the spatial is a lot better on the 4s. I‚Äôm able to find my phone a lot faster due to that. The 4s do fall out of my ear a lot more than the 2 but they are also a lot smaller in my opinion and don‚Äôt hurt my ears as much as the 2s did. I can wear them all night and they feel fine. I have also notice the call quality is better on the 4s. 
Just my opinion"
2025-01-14,"Pro2, definitely, they are considered to be the best"
2025-01-29,"I recently visited the Apple Store and tested both the AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2. Both impressed me with their audio quality and build, but here‚Äôs a detailed comparison based on my experience:

Active Noise Cancellation (ANC):

While the AirPods Pro 2 have slightly better ANC, the difference isn‚Äôt huge. The AirPods 4‚Äôs ANC is surprisingly effective. I shook my head and jumped with full force while wearing them, and they stayed securely in place.

Key Features and Differences:

AirPods 4:

	‚Ä¢	Comfort: Extremely comfortable, ideal for long hours of wear.
	‚Ä¢	Fit: Feels slightly less secure due to its lightweight, comfort-focused design.
	‚Ä¢	Mic Quality: Surprisingly better than the AirPods Pro 2.
	‚Ä¢	Volume Control: Lacks touch volume control, but you can easily adjust it using Siri.
	‚Ä¢	Future Expectations: Apple will likely remove volume control entirely, shrink the case size, and make it even more portable in future versions.

AirPods Pro 2:

	‚Ä¢	Fit: Offers a tight, secure, and snug fit in the ear canal, making it great for sports and physical activities.
	‚Ä¢	ANC: Slightly superior noise cancellation compared to the AirPods 4.
	‚Ä¢	Battery Life: Better battery performance.
	‚Ä¢	Comfort: Feels heavier and can create pressure in the ear canal, making it uncomfortable for extended use.
	‚Ä¢	Precision Finding: Exclusive feature that helps locate misplaced AirPods.
	‚Ä¢	Volume Control: Features swipe-based volume control for easy adjustments.

Conclusion:

If you prefer comfort over a tight fit and can‚Äôt wear in-ear or over-ear headphones for long periods, go with the AirPods 4. They‚Äôre lightweight, easy to wear for hours, and offer great mic quality.

However, if you‚Äôre active in sports or need a secure, snug fit, the AirPods Pro 2 are the better choice. Just be aware that the tighter fit may cause pressure and discomfort over time."
2025-01-31,Airpods 4 non ancs are useless junk in urban spaces. Scam product by so called ‚Äúapple‚Äù
2025-03-17,"I've got both.  For me, the AP4 / ANC are more comfortable, but the APP2 has SLIGHTLY better ANC.  The ANC on the AP4 is amazingly good considering there is no seal, but the APP2 obviously has better ANC given that it has a silicone plug.  But I don't like having to 'work the seal' into my ear every time, and after an hour or so, my ears feel 'fatigued' compared to the APP4s. 

But be aware - the Apple store will demo both of them to you and let you stand there for an hour if you want, trying them both.  I couldn't believe how the entire store went totally silent when I popped in the simple AP4s !"
2024-12-13,"4 acn are odwety good, but would buy pro2 if would choose again"
2024-12-13,Pro 2 easily
2024-12-13,pro 2 i love mine
2024-12-13,"Pro 2, worth it"
2024-12-13,"Pro 2 
The noise cancellation and other features definitely make it worth the money imo"
2024-12-13,I have both. Get the AirPods Pro 2. 100%.
2024-12-13,"airpods 2 costco, best buy on sale"
2024-12-13,Pro 2 of course
2024-12-13,I use my Pro 2s 8-12 hrs a day. They‚Äôre incredible especially if you‚Äôre going to consistently use ANC. The ANC works extremely well even when using one earpiece at a time.
2024-12-13,"The AirPods Pro 2 offer several key advantages over the AirPods 4, making them a better choice for most users:
	
1.	Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and Transparency Mode: The AirPods Pro 2 come with industry-leading ANC to block out external noise and a Transparency Mode for situational awareness. The AirPods 4 don‚Äôt offer either of these features.

2.	Improved Sound Quality: With a more immersive audio experience, the AirPods Pro 2 have better sound quality, thanks to their adaptive EQ and spatial audio capabilities, which adjust to the shape of your ear for a more personalized experience.

3.	Comfort and Fit: The Pro 2 includes customizable silicone ear tips for a secure fit, making them ideal for long use and workouts. The AirPods 4 rely on a universal fit that might not work for everyone.

4.	Advanced Features: The AirPods Pro 2 come with features like adaptive transparency, better sweat/water resistance, and Precision Finding with a U1 chip in the case, making them a more robust and versatile option.

5.	Battery Life and Case: Both models have strong battery life, but the Pro 2‚Äôs MagSafe charging case includes a speaker and lanyard loop for added convenience.

For a slightly higher price, the AirPods Pro 2 deliver a premium experience that‚Äôs worth the investment, especially if you value noise cancellation, sound quality, and comfort."
2024-12-13,AirPods Pro 2 especially if you want noise canceling. There was deals were the pros were the same price as the 4‚Äôs with ANC
2024-12-13,"pro 2, not having a silicon tip just hurts my ear and also feels loose"
2024-12-13,pro 2 and it‚Äôs not even a competition
2024-12-13,AirPods Pro 2 have been life changing for me once you get used to the silicon‚Ä¶
2024-12-13,Pro 2. The insulation tips make a world of difference with ANC
2024-12-13,"airpods pro 2 for sure , better sound quality and the battery lasts longer"
2024-12-13,I‚Äôve always had the AirPod pro 2 and lost them. I decided to be cheap and get the AirPod 4. So disappointing. THEN one fell out of my ear because of their lack of grip. Ended up going back for the AirPod pro 2.
2024-12-13,Pro 2 well worth it
2024-12-13,I just got the APP 2. Def a great upgrade from the first gen Pros.
2024-12-13,Pro 2!
2024-12-13,"Pro 2, no doubt!"
2024-12-13,"Pro 2. Get it at Costco, it‚Äôs the best deal. Comes with AppleCare."
2024-12-13,"I have the pro 2 and let me tell you, those are the most solid apple earbuds on the market in terms of sound quality. Just maybe get apple care cause they might or might not fail in their lifetime, mine have been good for a year, but my old pro 1s broke down a lot"
2024-12-13,"Pro 2. Better sound quality (mostly), better fit, and way better noise cancellation than the 4 with ANC.

I bought the 4s with ANC and they kept on sliding out of my ears. My previous AirPods 2 (non-pro) were a perfect fit. I ended up giving the 4s to a friend solely for that reason and buying the Pro 2 (even though I typically -hate- in ear headphones).

Honestly, they still slide out of my ears a tiny bit sometimes, but they never fall completely out and just require readjusting. I‚Äôve tried all the tip sizes and think this is as good as it gets. Obviously, YMMV. The Pro 2 is the only IEMs I‚Äôve use with silicone tips that don‚Äôt cause me discomfort.

The AirPods 4 did sound a tiny bit more clear, but every other aspect of the sound is worse. The ANC in the 4s is the worst I‚Äôve heard of any headphones in its price range, while the 2 Pros have more effective noise cancelling than my flagship Senneiser Momentum 4 over ear. I was pretty blown away.

TLDR, get the Pro 2."
2024-12-13,"We should pin a note at the top of the sub that just says ‚ÄúYes, the Pro 2s are still better than the standard 4s‚Äù"
2024-12-13,Haven‚Äôt tried the 4 but got the pro 2 3 weeks ago and love them! There amazing. I wear them all day at work for the anc they work awesome.
2024-12-13,"Pro 2 - Amazon has them on sale atm for $189 - it‚Äôs a steal 

Got them myself Black Friday for $148 , can‚Äôt beat it"
2024-12-13,"APP2 gen 2 (USB-C). They are expensive but great so if you can afford them, buy them - but don‚Äôt buy them second hand. The fakes show genuine numbers and look so close to the real ones, it can be very hard to tell the difference. 

I have the APP1 and as soon as I can afford the new ones, I‚Äôll buy them. The batteries on these are worn down."
2024-12-13,I bought the pro 2s and they are great. Any will be good tho
2024-12-13,"Pro, they fit so much better with the rubber thing"
2024-12-13,Pro 3
2024-12-14,"Pro 2 and if you lost one AirPod, you can just buy the missing piece separately."
2024-12-14,Pro 2. Without a doubt.
2024-12-14,"I can say I had Pro 2‚Äôs, bought 4s, returned 4‚Äôs, kept Pro 2‚Äôs.¬†

4‚Äôs felt like they were not secure in my ear after being used to Pro 2‚Äôs (I‚Äôm sure they actually were)."
2024-12-14,I‚Äôd say the Pro‚Äôs 2‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs because I can‚Äôt use any earbuds without the squishy tips
2024-12-14,"Pro 2! I got the twos specifically for the ear tips, cause I was afraid they‚Äôd fall out. That being said, they‚Äôre pretty good! I really like them a lot."
2024-12-14,AirPods Pro 2 >>>>>>> anything else
2024-12-14,I personally can't use any ear buds that don't have silicon tips. I generally don't use Apple products but one of my daughters has the 4's the other has the 2 pro's and I've used them both quite a bit and for me personally there is nothing about the 4's that would make me choose them over the others.
2024-12-14,Pro 2 all the way! Life changing
2024-12-14,For me the pro 2 fit better. I love em
2024-12-14,Pro2 always
2024-12-14,AirPods Pro 2 definitely. Best earphones I‚Äôve ever used. And I‚Äôve tried almost all AirPods.
2024-12-14,Should I give you an advice or a suggestion?
2024-12-14,"I didn‚Äôt bother, jumped ship to Sennheiser MTW4 and haven‚Äôt looked back.    
I know this will probably get some hate üòâ, but personally I think they look better too (copper/black)."
2024-12-14,Dude the 4 hurt my ears üò´
2024-12-13,"Pro 2 if you can afford them, it‚Äôs far more for the money"
2024-12-13,Pro 2 with comply foam/ foam master ear tips has been world changing.
2024-12-13,Pros 2 u can buy customized ear tips from amazon like foam masters for $25 and up
2024-12-13,"i have both 4 and pro
2, definitely go with pro 2, better quality, anc, bonus if you like silicone tips"
2024-12-13,Bose
2024-12-13,"It's basically audio quality vs. convenience. Airpods 4s are a lot easier to just pop in and out of your ear when you're taking calls or watching Youtube or whatever, and probably a bit more comfortable long term simply due to not having something shoved into your ear canal, but the sound quality, while decent, isn't even close to the Pros (assuming they're properly fitted for your ears). Both have their use case. Also, there are ""purchase defender"" people here lately who will downvote anyone for saying that the Airpod 4s don't sound as good as the Pros but like... just look into how IEMs work. They can't possibly sound better if they're fitted properly for your ears. They're simply not engineered to sound as good. What they are is a lot less of a pain to use. 

Personally, I've been gravitating away from IEMs in favor of over-ear headphones for serious music listening (both for comfort and sound quality) but my Airpods still get a good amount of use."
2024-12-13,AirPods Pro 2 has a larger battery than the AirPods 4
2024-12-14,Someone stole my 3‚Äôs so I bought the Pro 2. Pro 2 is the best no contest
2024-12-14,"i don't like tips, i picked up the 4"
2024-12-14,Idk I just bought the 4s bc they were cheaper
2024-12-14,Are you fellow sheep waiting for the AirPod 5‚Äôs or getting the 4‚Äôs?
2024-12-14,Air pod 1s
2024-12-15,neither.
2024-12-14,This is the way. Last week the APP2s were on sale and were almost the same price as the AP4s.
2024-12-14,I‚Äôve used both. The Pros are much much better than the 4s. Even the price suggests that.
2024-12-15,Plus the hearing health features
2024-12-15,"Not to forget, that can act as OTC Hearing Aids, which is why I got them."
2024-12-16,The pro twos I bought and they don‚Äôt fit in my ear. I even took the silicone tip and put it in the smallest ones and they still fall out of my ear and then I got those other Apple AirPods without the silicone tips. Those don‚Äôt fit in my ear eitherthey all fall out
2024-12-16,Do you have to use the tips? I hate the feeling of those in my ears
2024-12-16,Nothing such better sound quality if you're the old model. The reason why pro 2 is a higher price bc of its in ear anc.
2024-12-14,I just got the pro 2 and they really hurt my ear in all sizes. No returns either :(
2024-12-14,Air pods 4 ANC.
2024-12-16,"OP, make sure you get the newest generation of the Pro 2! They have newer models but they're still just called Pro 2."
2024-12-17,Never realized how much different the Pros were until I got them myself. It's honestly staggering.
2024-12-14,mine stopped working after 4 years so not entirely sure if it‚Äôs worth the money
2024-12-14,Wait for the airpods pro 3s coming out Q1 2025
2024-12-14,"It‚Äôs all dependent on your ears. Every time I‚Äôve tried pros, with an arrangement of different tips, they fall out of my ears. I have no problems with regular airpods."
2024-12-13,"The noise canceling on the twos is so bad? I remember my first generation AirPods (before Apple destroyed ANC with an update) and I couldn‚Äôt even hear myself snap! It was really good.
The update ruined them, ended up getting 2 pros after awhile because I heard it was better‚Ä¶ and they are exactly the same noise canceling as the 1‚Äôs, post-update. Garbage. Not worth even calling noise canceling"
2024-12-14,Why do people not realize that you can simply just buy different sized ear cover pieces that will fit whatever ear hole size you have?
2024-12-14,"Same. I had to return the Pro 2‚Äôs because almost immediately my ears ached (with all tips). Meanwhile my partner says they‚Äôre the comfiest earbuds ever. 
OP, if Pro 2 already worked for you, stick with that!"
2024-12-14,"I only like original 2‚Äôs no pros, i don‚Äôt want to discover if they fit in my ear or not fuck allll of that"
2025-01-22,Can people hear what u listening in AirPods 4?
2024-12-13,I‚Äôm just afraid that I‚Äôll get the 4s and they‚Äôll be slipping out of my ears all the time
2024-12-13,Why did you return them? Did they not fit?
2024-12-13,[removed]
2024-12-13,"Same, get the Pro 2"
2024-12-14,"I bought both of them and returned them both lmao. The sound quality isn‚Äôt all that great. However, the noise canceling is good."
2024-12-14,The top comment really needs to be about fit/ preference. Non-pro AirPods fit in my ears way better than anything with a silicone tip so that‚Äôs my preference but it‚Äôs inverse for a lot of people
2024-12-13,The four with anc is buggy when it gets too loud though
2024-12-13,Complys and thats x10 better with pros.
2024-12-14,I couldn‚Äôt agree more. I‚Äôve had both & currently using the 4th Gen ANC & have no regrets in changing. They‚Äôre smaller but so much more comfortable & louder in my opinion.
2024-12-20,thanks for this !
2025-01-22,Does people hear what u listening in AirPods 4?
2025-01-22,Is it as loud as gen 2 AirPods?
2024-12-15,It‚Äôs that or kicking a winning goal in soccer is how all my friends torn their ACLs
2024-12-14,What more features?
2025-01-22,Can people hear what u listening in ur AirPods 4?
2024-12-13,It wouldn‚Äôt make sense for me to replace when my current ones are so old
2024-12-13,I‚Äôm not rich enough to afford both at the same time
2024-12-14,You can hear your surrounding with the pro 2. ANC/transparency mode etc are magic ü™Ñ
2024-12-14,I‚Äôm scared that the AirPods 4 will keep slipping out of my ears
2024-12-14,"For some weird reason, pods without the silicon tips don't fit well with my ears. The sounds are muffled, and it feels like the shape of my ears blocks the vents where the sound is coming.

AirPods Pro 2 is a better fit for me."
2024-12-14,Where does it cost 150???
2024-12-15,WTF
2024-12-13,Brother did you type this with your toes
2024-12-13,Link?
2024-12-14,Amazon had a smokin deal around Black Friday too. Costco‚Äôs deal includes AppleCare so it‚Äôs usually the best around.
2024-12-13,I can only afford the AirPods 4 right now
2024-12-14,ChatGPT answered this one lol
2024-12-13,How much is it?
2024-12-14,Why not both?
2024-12-14,My biggest fearüò©
2024-12-13,I currently can only really afford the AirPods 4 rn. Maybe I could just have those as backup and purchase the AirPods Pro 2 as my main ones in the future. Idk
2024-12-14,Yep I got mine couple weeks ago for $160 on amazon
2024-12-14,Man the old airpods use to go on sale for $80 and i got a second pair cuz my first pair was dying after a couple years. The new entry level airpors are only gonna be worth it if they drop to that again
2024-12-15,What about the BBC?
2024-12-15,"My APP2s were lost for 2 months. I went to their last know place (a business) and they were nowhere to be found. Fast forward to that Target sale. I order new ones for $140. The day after I pick them up, I find my old ones in my backpack. üòû I was a bit confused because when using Find My, they said they were at the business I was at."
2024-12-15,They are almost always on sale somewhere.
2024-12-17,"During the Black Friday days a while back, they were around $150. It was actually crazy."
2024-12-14,Try the comply foam tips on Amazon. They sell an assorted size package.
2024-12-14,Getting downvoted for saying your ears hurt is crazyüòπüòπ
2024-12-14,Mine hurt for a couple days when I first got them then they stopped hurting. No issues now for years.
2024-12-14,"I agree the pros sound much better, but are not as comfortable."
2024-12-14,They hurt for me in the first hour or so then it went away. Something with the noise cancelling.
2024-12-14,"I love how ur getting downvoted but i never use earphones bc my ears are too small and they fall out, but normal airpod 2s fit perfectly and are alot more comfortable. Its personal preference ig"
2024-12-16,Mine did too till I realized you just have to position them differently (properly) in your ear üòÇ
2024-12-14,"While this is true, ANC without a seal in your ear is kind of questionable."
2024-12-14,Your kaka loco buy the best airpods 4 anc
2024-12-14,"Pro 2 is NOT 4 years old lmao. Besides, I still got pro 1 since launch and it still works as new."
2024-12-14,They‚Äôve been out for 2 years‚Ä¶
2024-12-14,4 years is a long time tbh. Many earbuds wouldn‚Äôt last more than 2.
2024-12-14,"If it‚Äôs really been 4 years, you must be talking about the 1st generation. AirPods Pro 2 came out in 2022."
2024-12-15,Why would you post something that anyone who knows anything about AirPods would know is a lie?
2024-12-14,4 years is a long time for earbuds especially if you're using them daily
2024-12-16,"omg guys my bad, I meant I got the AirPods Pro 1st gen in 2020 and mine have stopped working"
2024-12-15,He should wait for the pro 7s in 2041
2024-12-15,"Funny enough it‚Äôs the exact opposite for me. Love Pro and can‚Äôt stand the regular style, they fall out and hurt my ears too much."
2024-12-14,OP it‚Äôs super dependent on your ears. I have a slightly different skull shape which changes what fits into either of my ears. The pros don‚Äôt fit my right ear well but the 4s fit it great. However the 4s fall out of my left ear a lot and the pros fit that side perfectly. I‚Äôm considering getting the pros because they seemed to stay in more scenarios but I‚Äôve been using them for a month and for casual use they‚Äôre not bad. But it‚Äôs really a case by case thing
2024-12-14,Same here. I‚Äôve always had smaller than average ear canals. I‚Äôm glad apple is taking care of us small eared ppl while also making a silicone tipped earphone too
2024-12-16,I have AirPods with the wire those fit in my ear perfect and never fall out. I have had these Apple AirPods generation three those don‚Äôt fit so I got the pro twos now those don‚Äôt fit. I don‚Äôt know what to do.
2024-12-16,So what AirPods do you have now because none of these Apple ones fit in my ear except for the ones that are wired
2024-12-14,"They are no headphones so you‚Äôll never get as good isolation with them.

The ANC is ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù for listening to music and content but it‚Äôs not the same experience as a pair of Sony headphones."
2024-12-14,Even the XS tips that I had to buy separately didn‚Äôt work for me. They quickly got uncomfortable. Some people just don‚Äôt like earbuds that intrude into their ear canals.
2024-12-14,Honestly I've tried every size and they all fall out of my ear
2024-12-13,Mine have never fallen out of that helps.  The 2s were super tight and very uncomfortable for me so I think I have a rather small ear.
2024-12-13,I actually find that pro 2‚Äôs fall out way easier than my regular 3‚Äôs ever did.
2024-12-14,They will.
2024-12-14,"I think it really depends. The 4s look like they are the same form factor as the 3s and they would fall out of my ears immediately. I had to buy little pads to put in the side of them and they worked, mostly. If you did a lot of walking, they still slipped out and you had to replace the pads every few months. You could be about 12 in a pack so you paid $13 every 6 months."
2024-12-14,The fit will depend on the shape of your ears since each person‚Äôs different. Only the Pros are good for me since regular airpods would slip from my ears.
2024-12-14,"If you have an Apple Store or a friend that is cool with you, put them in and shake your head back and forth. I saw a Marques Brownlee do this and they fall out instantly in his ears. There are 2 types of people those who can wear AirPods and those that they just fall out of."
2024-12-14,Yup. 4s are better if they fit. Pros are better if they 4/ s don‚Äôt fit .
2024-12-14,Well I had the pros and they never stayed in my ear no matter which tips I used. The only reason AirPods 4 even exist is because a number of people simply can't use pros and this is an alternative for them. Honestly I'm not sure what is the best way to know which ones will work better for you aside from just trying them. Hopefully you can get them from a place with a good return policy. Otherwise keep the box and keep them in good shape for maximum resale value.
2024-12-14,"AirPods Pro‚Äôs silicone ear tips were uncomfortable and made the earbuds keep slipping out of my ears, especially during exercise.

I stuck with them for a while, but they never felt comfortable to me.

I went with the AirPods 4 with ANC. Solved that problem.

It ultimately just depends on your ear shape as well as preference."
2024-12-14,"Pros gave me ear ache, I worried the same as you and just did it anyway and I love the 4s! Don't even notice they're in"
2024-12-14,"Even with the pro 2s they‚Äôre gonna slip out of your ear. I‚Äôve dropped mine dozens of times over the years, they still work fine though even though there‚Äôs some cosmetic damage"
2024-12-14,"Mine would not fit and kept falling out and there‚Äôs no way to make them without putting a little sticky tape on them the pro 2‚Äôs are fantastic, especially with theANC"
2024-12-15,"My problem was the original AirPods fit me best. I bought the 3‚Äôs (cause I‚Äôm not a fan of the inner ear tip seals that the 2‚Äôs are) and those fell out of my ears after a solid 10 mins. I decided to try the 4‚Äôs and they fit better in my ears than the 3‚Äôs did, and don‚Äôt fall out, but they DO feel loose sometimes, like I have to adjust them. You could always try the 4s OR pros, and you are allowed to return them within 21 days, if I‚Äôm not mistaken. I hope you get some you‚Äôre happy with!"
2024-12-15,"In my experience AirPods have always sat pretty secure in my ears. Reviews on YouTube corroborate. IMO it comes down to whether or not your ear canal is large enough to comfortably fit the gel tips. Mine aren‚Äôt so I went with the 4‚Äôs


Also as far as the ANC goes, I have the 4‚Äôs and background noise is unnoticeable when I have music playing 90% of the time. The only time I‚Äôve had background noise noticeably leak through with music on was refueling next to a busy highway, and waiting for food in a busy restaurant, but these will still be much quieter. Percussive sounds like a door shutting or compressors running will leak through."
2024-12-13,They just wouldn‚Äôt stay in my ear securely. They felt cheap.
2024-12-13,"As someone who just bought the 4s yesterday, I'm going to return them too. Imo the sound quality is awful and the bass is extremely amplified. They just sound weird and cheaply made, I'm disappointed because I really thought I would like them. Have been needing new airpods for a while. Probably going to go and try the Pro 2s now or just stick with my regular 2nd Gens."
2024-12-13,"The sound cancellation was weird while flying, the software did not adequately adjust and there is no manual override."
2024-12-14,"What you mean ""fit""? They are just regular earphones, they won't fit tightly like the IAC"
2024-12-14,"Listen!! Most ppl hate the rubber buds, if you are like me and enjoy them, get the pros!! (Or new pros possible soon who knows?) 
Apple made AirPod 4 with ‚Äúanc‚Äù bc so many ppl hate rubber tips, it‚Äôs nowhere near the quality experience."
2024-12-13,"The 4 don‚Äôt stay in your ear, they feel cheap."
2024-12-14,I have Bose sport buds and sound quality is better than the Apple. But the Apple AirPods integrate better with the iPhone and Siri plus all the other features. I use the Bose for biking and the Apple for home
2024-12-13,"Yeah, I saw people talking about that on YouTube. I‚Äôm sure they will improve on it but it‚Äôs pretty exciting that finally there‚Äôs ANC for an open earbuds. It will only get better."
2024-12-14,huh
2025-01-22,No idea.
2024-12-15,i just woke up from a dream that i jumped and ran. no fun. my first ever major injury but it has not been a good time at all.
2024-12-14,"better noise cancellation, volume control on the buds themselves, hearing aid features + more"
2025-01-22,You mean people around us ?
2025-01-22,"I never asked anyone, but I assume not. I barely have to go above half volume"
2024-12-13,"If you have Apple Store near you, you can try for free. And depending where you‚Äôre from, you may purchase it and return it if it doesn‚Äôt fit well."
2025-01-22,Depends on the volume
2024-12-14,"Why not grab one and try for a week? If it doesn‚Äôt work, replace for pro"
2024-12-14,That's perfectly valid. Everyone has different ears. It's just a matter of personal fit and preference.
2024-12-13,I think the Nothing ear 3 is better and it has an application for it
2024-12-14,I have the AirPod 4s without anc and they are great I have had no problem with them and they stay in my ears with no problems never falling out I have not tried the pro 2s tho but for the price they are very nice
2024-12-13,"$200. It comes with AppleCare which extends your warranty for an additional 2 years. This is the best deal, but you do need a Costco membership."
2024-12-13,Then it sounds like you already have your answer
2024-12-13,"Well, that is certainly up to you. I own the generation two the generation threes and the pros. They‚Äôre all good. They just have different feature sets in different controls."
2025-01-26,Most lf the time no but if it‚Äôs really quiet and your AirPods are at 100% volume then a little bit
2024-12-15,"I did the same at Target after getting some refunds on items I purchased that went on sale,  mine were $125."
2024-12-15,I ordered mine on Black Friday and still haven‚Äôt received it
2024-12-21,"Wait, what?"
2024-12-14,Will do! Any recommendations?
2024-12-14,"For some reason I seem to have really small ears, like my left side is S and my right side is XS. It seems like in my right ear the XS can slide out easily (not like actively falling out but if I move my head correctly it will fall out. I've gone on runs and maybe had to adjust it, but I'd like to start being more active with them in and would really like them to stay in the whole time), but the S is somehow too big I can literally feel it slipping out. I really like Apple but it's poor design imo, do the foam tips counter that? Like, do they 'grip' (for lack of a better word) your ear so they don't fall out? It seems like they would but I've never heard of them. And do you think the sizes are pretty comparable or is there any big difference?"
2024-12-14,Honestly! Yet im getting downvoted by appletards because my ears aren‚Äôt shaped like theirs üòÇ
2024-12-14,"Your ear canals hurt from the tips or your eardrums hurt from the ANC? The OP is referring to the former, but I think you‚Äôre referring to the latter."
2024-12-17,"Yea Samsung tried that out with their galaxy buds live, the ANC was so bad you wouldn‚Äôt even know when it was on or not"
2024-12-14,Not really. It's just not as good. Doesn't mean it doesn't work at all.
2024-12-14,"I mean, they did commit to their name"
2024-12-14,4 years is only long in comparison because of the state of the industry‚Ä¶ if I pay 300$ i should expect them to work longer
2024-12-14,Had my APP1 for nearly 5 Years without complaints; bought the second ones just because I throw the first ones into the washing machine üò¨
2024-12-15,‚Ä¶ or literally 3-4 months: https://www.yahoo.com/tech/apple-airpods-pro-3-tipped-080000568.html
2024-12-15,"I bought different tips for mine and thT worked for me. Never like the standard AirPods. Move accurately, my ears don‚Äôt."
2024-12-16,I borrowed my wife‚Äôs normal AirPods and I basically bruised my ear canal. Now my pros that I have never had an issue with are hurting me. Everyone is different though.
2024-12-16,It‚Äôs an either/or depending on peoples ears. You either love or hate one of them.
2024-12-15,"Just make sure you twist them in your ear, someone at work was complaining his pros were coming out and all he had to do is twist them after putting them in"
2024-12-14,"Brother I know exactly how good the ANC could be, it‚Äôs just that they completely nerf‚Äôed it in an update shortly after all the reviews were done, on BOTH the original and the 2‚Äôs, they got nerfed after purchase for me. 

Widely documented, ask anybody who had the OG firmware it was so good you‚Äôd have friends try it and be amazed. Now you can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs on or not."
2024-12-14,"This is kind of gross, but I think part of it is the ear wax gets onto the rubber tips and essentially greases them up so they fall right out which is shitty design. Not that I know how to counteract it, but still, I think that might be the issue. I really like the AirPods but I do wish they stayed in better. Someone in this thread recommended Comply, which makes like foam tips so I might try that. If it stays in I'll be obsessed with it lol"
2024-12-13,Aren‚Äôt they the same build quality of the pros minus the silicone tips? I‚Äôm looking at getting 4s
2024-12-13,This is my fear. I have a feeling they will keep falling out
2024-12-14,"I bought the 4s and was going to return them, because of sound quality, until I read about the ‚ÄúHeadphone Accommodations‚Äù accessibility setting. It bumps up the mids and highs and, for me, it fixes the sound quality issue. The ANC works surprisingly well too. 

I like the 4s l but they are overpriced @ $180. I managed to grab them on a sale last weekend for $138. 

I have the APP2 and they are better headphones. Costco usually has them for $199 and that price includes Apple Care."
2024-12-15,I love the pro 2s and the noise cancelling is amazing with them.
2024-12-13,"It doesn‚Äôt fit everyone‚Äôs ears, what works for others may not work for you. I‚Äôm glad you like the Pros though!"
2024-12-14,"I think it was a reference to 'Comply', a brand of replacement tips which can be used in the Pro's. I use them and the fit is much better and they don't fall out as easily as the original Apple tips."
2024-12-14,Thanks! Can i also change song on the buds?
2024-12-13,Ugh
2024-12-13,But I‚Äôm worried what if I buy the 4s and they don‚Äôt fit in my ears properly
2024-12-15,For Airpods Pro 2? Is that with the refund value applied toward your purchase?
2024-12-14,Comply is the brand name.  Search for ‚Äúcomply air pod tips‚Äù or something like that.   There‚Äôs a set with three different sizes.
2024-12-14,I think the sizes are pretty comparable. I used medium of the standard rubber ones and the foam comply ones.  The foam stays in a lot better for me. I‚Äôm not super active but I use them for probably 6 hours a day at work and they don‚Äôt fall out.
2024-12-17,Definitely try some foam tips I had a similar fitting issue with the silicon ones but I loved my foam ones. Only issue with foam tips is cleaning
2024-12-17,"Look up AirPod pro 2 ear hooks. Ive been using them since the first AirPods were released, probably haven‚Äôt used any AirPod without them since. I ride motorcycles too, (with one AirPod in) and with the windshield open on my helmet the ear hooks will keep the AirPod sturdy in my ear. They come with one that slips over the ear insert part, and one that hooks around the ear like glasses."
2024-12-14,"Yeah, I‚Äôm not sure why the downvotes for an honest plea. Not all of us are ‚Äúappletards.‚Äù"
2024-12-14,‚ÄúQuestionable‚Äù = ‚Äúnot as good.‚Äù He never said it doesn‚Äôt work at all.
2024-12-14,Where did I say it didn't work at all?
2024-12-14,If that was true why wouldn‚Äôt the Pros have the ‚Äúgood‚Äù ANC??
2024-12-15,I‚Äôd say cleaning both your ears the AirPod tips more frequently is a good start
2024-12-13,They didn‚Äôt feel like the pro 2. They were even lighter and didn‚Äôt feel snugged in the ear. They would fall out every time I bend over or tipped my head. That‚Äôs just me could be different for you.
2024-12-13,The pro 2 stay better in the ear. I say get the 2 and they are on sale.
2024-12-14,Yea I did that whole thing but it still doesn't sound right. Would you say the pro 2s have better sound quality. Like is the bass not so funky
2024-12-13,"Yes, fits mine perfectly. I find the silicon tip style earphones uncomfortable.

Still, if you know the Pros are comfortable, I'd go with those."
2024-12-13,Your right .
2024-12-14,"yes, you double press the airpod to skip and triple press to restart song/go back"
2024-12-14,"If you‚Äôre not interested in a Costco membership, you can always find someone you know who does."
2024-12-13,You should return them if it turns out they're not for you.
2024-12-15,I wasn‚Äôt very clear. I purchased some items prior that went on sale Black Friday week. I had Target refund me the difference between purchase price and sale price. They will do this within two weeks of purchase.
2024-12-14,Thank you so much!
2024-12-16,"Alright thank you! Like I said my right ear is XS, do you think using an S form tip for it would cause any discomfort or anything? Or is pretty form fitting if you will, like it won't press against my ear super hard?"
2024-12-17,"Alright, I'll definitely try them out! Do you have any tips for cleaning them like how often, what to use etc? Or does the manufacturer sell a cleaning kit of sorts as well?"
2024-12-17,"Thank you! I just looked those up, seriously considering them now. Do you happen to know if they're compatible with the foam tips someone else recommended? If not that's ok, it's kind of a long shot tbf. They look to be, but I'd be curious to know what a real user thinks lol"
2024-12-14,"What? Again, it did! It was amazing!"
2024-12-16,"I looked at it but I couldn't find any that seem marketed specifically for AirPods (or really anything at all tbh) except hearing aid cleaners, do you have any recommendations?"
2024-12-14,"I got the AirPods 3 and they did the same to me. Kept falling out, was too big for my ears. But I even tried the pro 1 and they also didn‚Äôt feel snug and I tried all the sizes. I just went back to my trusty Apple earbuds on wire."
2024-12-13,On sale? On the apple website they are literally the normal 250 dollar price
2024-12-14,And you would think earbuds being able to stay put in your ear is the bare minimum especially for the cost.
2024-12-13,And left
2024-12-14,The press is so annoying considering the pod is so small. Why did they remove the tap on the pod for gestures? It was in first gen
2024-12-15,Yea. Same here. But I got two refunds within the timeframe as negot or ice down to $159
2025-01-03,It‚Äôs mostly a cue tip and a metal or plastic pick. You‚Äôd probably be best buying multiple sets as they are foam but plus side they‚Äôre cheap. Definitely DO NOT use rubbing alcohol I did and they melted.
2024-12-14,So why did apple remove it? I‚Äôm trying to get to the bottom of your conspiracy
2024-12-16,This is exactly what I had to do. I want headphones that aren‚Äôt why you‚Äôre though.
2024-12-13,Are you in Canada or USA?
2024-12-13,I been seen them on sale I guess in the USA. I just checked Best Buy has them for 299$.
2024-12-14,It was on sale for Black Friday/ Cyber Monday.
2024-12-14,[Bro‚Ä¶](https://a.co/d/f4wGKG5)
2024-12-14,"Buddy it‚Äôs not my conspiracy. 
On gen 1, it was related to their lawsuits 
On the pro 2‚Äôs, no idea. But I got a call from a friend after the 7A249 update ‚Äúthey‚Äôve fucked it again‚Äù and I pulled mine out, they still worked good, checked and they were on previous firmware. 

So I tried to charge the case without the AirPods in them for as long as I could(they can‚Äôt update like that)
But eventually one side lost its pair with the case and I had to remove and re set them up, it updated them, and bam, ANC totally sucks. 

It‚Äôs not a conspiracy, I don‚Äôt know why they did it, it‚Äôs just what happened.


Edit: the firmware that killed ANC was 7a294, not 249"
2024-12-13,USA
2024-12-14,"Best Buy has them for 249, but they‚Äôve been on and off sale for a while, and I‚Äôm sure other places that have them for under $200 currently"
2024-12-14,"Thank you for the details, I‚Äôm a nerd who‚Äôs curious so I wanted you to explain yourself haha.

Excuse me while I sink into this google hole"
2024-12-13,Unless the sale is over the last week I‚Äôve seen all kinds of post regarding the sale of AirPods in the USA.
2024-12-13,"Target had them on sale $60 off twice in the last few weeks.  
Edited: To add a keyword"
2024-12-14,I‚Äôm not the guy who said they got worse -_-
