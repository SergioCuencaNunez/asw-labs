2024-11-20,"No, I‚Äôm skipping because this is legitimately the longest post I have ever seen on reddit. You put to shame every teenager who writes a book on their relationship problems."
2024-11-20,Any chance you can expand on your thoughts üòí
2025-02-05,"A bit long lol but anyway, thanks to this post, I got the AirPods Pro 2 they are much better from the 1 generation. Any suggestions for a leather case?"
2024-11-20,I would love to read these but it's just too long man. Maybe try paraphrasing each paragraph? Would love to read these if it were shorter.
2024-11-20,"I love that in spite of the extensive knowledge and experience offered in this post, I will see at least 5 more posts tomorrow of ""Are the Airpods Pro 2 worth it?"""
2024-11-20,"Nice review. Not sure why you're getting cooked for it being long. Would rather a review be detailed than it be just a set of bullet points with no elaboration. Was able to get through *most* of it without skipping to the bottom, though I did skip some of the later sections comparing the APP2 with the APP1 and the AP4 since I already own the APP2. I generally agree with you on most points with a few differences in opinion that mostly come down to personal preference. Only nitpick would be your equating larger headphone driver size with better sound quality since it's not quite as simple as that, but otherwise, good looks üëç"
2024-11-20,"i have been rocking them since there release however I have always had terrible experience with the microphone, sound quality is good for ear buds for sure but nothing out of the world, a 60$ noise cancelling over the ear headphone easily outperforms airpods, but can not give you the portability and the apple experience."
2024-11-20,"I dont mind this being long, clearly you enjoyed doing it more people need to just do things they find joy in and pass on it if they don't rather than dragging others down for doing it in the first place."
2024-11-20,"Though seeing the post I thought it‚Äôs too long to read, when I started reading it was flowing. I could also see which portions I can skip. Good writing. Thanks for the review. I got a pair of AirPods Pro C version from my company. I have to set it up."
2024-11-20,"I appreciate how much detail you went into, as someone deciding whether to buy APP2 when they go on sale to upgrade from the OGs. Yes, it is a long post... I didn't have time to read it, so I chose to have Siri read it to me -- id rather have all the info from someone who has used all the options for a long time that what most reveiws are... ""I just got these today, they seem amazing so far!"" LOL"
2024-11-21,My English teacher is hounding me for the annotations on this puppy. due Friday
2024-11-21,"People hating on the best, most thorough review   I've seen on AirPods Pro gen 2s is so stupid. If you want a review, you should want one with all the details you can fit in it. I know that half the people hating are very unsatisfied with their other purchases due to the fact they can't read a review cuz it's ""too long""."
2024-11-22,Nice review. I‚Äôm a new Air Pod user and mainly bought them as a hearing aid. After many years in a manufacturing environment my ability to hear high soft voices is frustrating. I also listen to music and have several blue tooth over the ear sets. The initial hearing test was a bust for me as it kept getting an error message in the end saying that the noise in the room was too loud. That wasn‚Äôt the problem and after reading on Apples forum it a big problem. I was able to use an App called Mimi and upload those results after an hour of hearing tests. I really like them and use them for everything from watching tv to any important conversations. They are a game changer for the money to me.
2024-11-20,Is this writing prompts?
2024-11-20,Do you expect anybody to read your dribble of a review
2024-11-20,Please elaborate on your points
2024-11-21,"motherfucker made an entire fucking essay for a pair of airpods jfc

thank god for that summary but‚Ä¶

GOOD MICROPHONE???? this sentence alone made your entire 10k word essay invalid. This is a very bad lie and there‚Äôs no way in heck you have any idea of how a mic should actually sound like"

2024-11-22,"Welp, that's probably around 5-10 minutes of Youtube video in writing.

I just have a question though, your battery life is 4-4.5 hours after 2 years of daily usage or that's what you got when it's brand new?"
2024-11-30,"Nice review and a good read. By some of the comments, it does amuse me how lazy people have gotten and expect everything to pushed into their eyeballs by some crappy TikTok video."
2024-12-26,this review has convinced me to pull the trigger and buy the APP 2‚Äôs. Thank you for taking your time and adding much needed details and personal experience with the product in question
2025-01-12,Thanks mate for this review‚Ä¶ I found a good deal of new airpods pro 2 with lightning for 150 euro and i was hesitant buying them due to the lightning. Seeing your post though changed my mind. Thanks
2025-03-16,Thank you for the comprehensive post. It was well written and nmot too long as it covers all aspects in detail and was very easy to read.
2024-11-20,"Great review. Idk why people are beating you up about how long the post is‚Ä¶
Wouldn‚Äôt you guys want a more in depth review? If you don‚Äôt have the time to read it that‚Äôs your problem, not OPs"
2024-11-20,Great well flushed out review! Willing to bet half the people commenting wouldn‚Äôt have an issue if there was some subway surfers at the bottom and an AI voice narrating it lol
2024-11-20,Going to have to Apple AI summary that
2024-11-20,"I tried apple airpod 2 after having beat fit pro and swear I couldn‚Äôt tell a sound quality difference,"
2024-11-20,"I bought these for video meetings but they neither work with Microsoft Teams, or Google Meet - known issue that Apple doesn't care to worry about."
2024-11-20,I‚Äòve seen other posts and noticed myself that the ANC has gotten worse maybe because of the hearing health updat? Did you notice the same thinng or is it just getting used to it?
2024-11-20,I‚Äòve seen other posts and noticed myself that ANC has gotten worse. Is it because of the hearing health update or just getting used to it?
2024-11-20,"Anyone has had problems with ANC?

Like i had blood dripping from my ears and it happened two times i read ANC it‚Äôs not safe to continuous use and i never had this problems until i bought my APP2 :(

Just ended never using ANC anymore"
2024-11-20,"Good review but I recently tried the APP2, and personally was not a fan with the sound, it was too neutral for my liking"
2024-11-20,They suck. Mine only lasted 2 years before being fried from using. Apple Store said there‚Äôs nothing they can do but I can drop 300 for a new pair. Fuck these.
2024-11-20,"I returned my AirPods Pro gen 2, sound quality was awful on them so idk if I got a bunk pair or not but they sounded so nasally and the bass was barely there. My xm4 earbuds are still superior"
2024-11-20,Nobody:  The Original AirPods are so comfortable
2024-11-20,This is so long it exceeds the context window of ChatGPT bro
2024-11-21,Skipped post and came straight here for the comments.
2024-11-21,"My long term review:



Sounds good. 1 and half years in the right side stopped working. Classic Apple move, 6/10"
2024-11-21,Mucho texto
2024-11-21,Someone lmk what happened to his case cuz ain‚Äôt nobody reading that post üòÇ
2024-11-22,Don‚Äôt know why so many people are ragging on an in-depth review‚Ä¶
2024-11-22,"I would want a review this long for a car maybe.

I ain‚Äôt reading all that for a pair of headphones ü§£"
2024-11-22,Yeah whatever just put the fries in the bag bro
2024-11-22,"crazy replies, thanks for this post. ill get a pair this black friday"
2024-11-22,What happened to the case? Looks melted
2024-11-22,"I've been using them for a couple months, they seem to be more reliable than jabra, sony or bose breakage wise in reviews with second best anc after bose, bose qc fails to even pair correctly, but inferior battery life to sony and not water resistant like jabra. I also got that terrible right bud buzzing bug a few times which is so unacceptable on a new product. Sometimes they won't even fix or replace your product if it has this. I have applecare and it's gone away so well see I guess. Like any bud besides sony I have to listen on like 35 percent volume with ANC enabled to get 4-5 hr battery life. I use them with android and works fine so far . They really need to aim for a higher water resistance as well

Can I turn on this loud sound reduction for better performance in full ANC mode? Any way to do in on android, or do it on an iPhone and keep it set that way on android"
2024-11-23,"I was having buyers remorse from purchasing them from Amazon because I already have the AirPod pros, but this post made me excited for them.

I‚Äôve had my AirPod pros since 2021 and I have definitely noticed battery degradation. The left pod also makes an odd sound unless I use both pods at the same time. That left pod also makes a weird sound to whoever I‚Äôm on the phone with, so I‚Äôm basically forced to only ever use the right pod.

I also had been looking into beats or sonys for my new headphones and was a bit sad I wouldn‚Äôt be trying something ‚Äúnew‚Äù but that feeling is also gone because I love my AirPods. This post made me excited to receive a brand new, upgraded pair of my favorite headphones.

Thanks for this write up, my buyers remorse has disappeared."
2024-11-23,Congrats on finishing your dissertation bro
2024-11-24,Shit even chat gpt malfunctioned when I asked it to summarize this saying it‚Äôs too long
2024-11-24,‚ÄúI have come to believe that AirPods cases are largely a mistake. They just make them more bulky and don‚Äôt do that much to protect them.‚Äù - I gave up reading at this point‚Ä¶
2024-11-24,"This weird thing about attention is really off putting. This is much longer than it needs to be and people are not interested in wasting their time listening to you wax poetics, get over yourself lmao. Gtfo here with that weird postering shit bro"
2024-11-24,"I have the AirPods first gen and second gen and I love it! Last year I found a brand new AirPods Pro 2, like 7 days since actived. I tried to reach out the owner but he was from another country and told me I could keep it since would be too much work to shipping and stuffs ( he might be some rich üòÖ). So now I‚Äôm using it and it‚Äôs pretty amazing. The noise cancellation it‚Äôs just amazing! To travelers it‚Äôs perfect! I could finally sleep in an airplane flight!"
2024-11-25,Good review bro
2024-11-27,"""Obviously, a pair of over-ear headphones like AirPods Max will have better sound quality and bass due to having much larger drivers, but for the size of the earbud, they‚Äôre super impressive.""  
I actually disagree. I \*am\* one of those audio people, and the airpods pro 2 sound multiple times better than the airpods max in my opinion. it's that much better. Seriously, these things sound amazing."
2024-11-28,Can anyone comment on their experience Airpods Pro 2nd Gen. vs. Airpods Pro 2
2024-11-29,this a video script not a Reddit post
2024-12-03,"Thanks for the review and your thoughts. They fit my ears well (which was not true with Airpod Pros 1, which fell out), and the sound and noise reduction greatly improved."
2024-12-04,i aint readin allatüò≠üôè
2024-12-05,"Even chatGPT could not summarise this. Thank you for the very long, detailed review"
2024-12-20,"At first glance, I didn‚Äôt want to read all of this. After all the hate comments, I decided to give this post a shot anyway. It was thorough, well written (as a review should be) and offered short summaries for those of you with learning issues. Well done and I found the information I needed!"
2024-12-22,Can you elaborate some more please ü§£
2024-12-22,"I read the whole review and like the comparisons with the airpods 4 and pros 2 as im in the market at the moment and was undecided. Coming from the AirPods 2, any of these two is an improvement. Thank you! Im gonna try to pros 2 as they are on sale at the moment."
2024-12-29,Very detailed thank you - just trying decide if I buy in man or wait 8 months now as I suspect the next will be out in September 2024
2025-01-01,"They're a waste of money. I bought $30 ear buds that do 100% what these do. They even provide more noise canceling. I took my new airpods out three or four times today because outside noise was bothering me. The price of this subpar product is exactly whi I avoid Apple like the plague. Only reason I bought them is my sister bought me a $15 case I loved that only fit them. Only good thing I can say, Apple is finally using the same charger port everything else is. In summary, if you enjoy your own farts and music on vinyl, this product is for you. If you actually work hard for your money and watch your budget, there are far better options."
2025-01-08,Have you had any issue with crackling sounds in noise cancellation mode?  That‚Äôs my main reason for wanting to upgrade.
2025-01-15,I read every single bit of your review and thoroughly appreciate the effort. I currently use Heavys H1H headphones and they‚Äôre the best I‚Äôve ever had. But they suck to travel with which is why I‚Äôm considering APP2. This was super helpful.
2025-01-20,Holy fuck even skipping over that took awhile.. I‚Äôm just gonna buy em lol
2025-01-22,Can you make this any fucking longer???
2025-01-26,just picked some up for $50. theyre pretty good.
2025-01-31,"Nice writeup. I just bought pro 2 and wanted to read someone‚Äôs experience, this fit the bill perfectly. Thanks."
2025-02-01,"So many people are hating on how long it is, and sure it‚Äôs long, but you‚Äôre getting overhated man. I read the whole thing and I know my exact thoughts on these airpods now lmao."
2025-02-12,"Thank you so much for the review.  I have the Shokz conduction set of headphones, and while they do a pretty good job when they work, they are inconsistent in connecting, and I am considering the Airpods Pro 2."
2025-02-13,I just bought my first air pods today at Costco for $180. I don't know if this is a good price as I never bought air pods before. I read 90% of your post and I think I made the right choice as you seem happy. Costco also had the regular 3rd gen there for $149. I will attempt to connect them to the phone now as I think the case is fully charged which I don't know but I had it plugged in to the charger for 2-3 hours. a red light blinks when i move the case but never see green. Maybe there is no green. Anyway thanks for your review.

2025-02-14,"Excellent review!  Mahalo nui!  And no, your review wasn‚Äôt too long, I appreciate your thoroughness. I have been using Sony WF-C700N earbuds for two years now. They‚Äôve done well, but they just lost the microphone function. I am considering buying AirPods Pro 2 or Bose QuietComfort. Any opinions on this choice are appreciated."
2025-02-18,"Here you go guys:

AirPods Pro 2: Two-Year Review Gist
Overall: The author is very satisfied with the AirPods Pro 2 after two years of daily use, citing excellent sound quality, impressive noise cancellation, and convenient features.  While there are some minor design flaws, they are overshadowed by the pros.
Key Points:
 * Design: Comfortable fit, durable buds, but the case scratches easily and the charging pins are finicky.  Case design could be improved to prevent AirPods from flying out when dropped.
 * Sound:  Excellent sound quality for the size, good microphone quality.  Personalized Spatial Audio is a plus, but Conversation Awareness and Personalized Volume are less useful. No built-in EQ.
 * ANC/Transparency: ANC is highly effective, even rivaling some over-ear headphones. Transparency mode is good but not as natural as removing the earbuds. Adaptive Audio is less useful than either.
 * Battery: Battery life is satisfactory, with quick charging. Degradation is noticeable after two years.
 * iOS 18:  Hearing health features (hearing test, hearing aid functionality, hearing protection) are revolutionary. Siri Interactions are less useful.  Spatial Audio for gaming and improved voice isolation are welcome additions.
 * Upgrades:  Upgrading from older AirPods or first-gen AirPods Pro is recommended if battery is degraded or new features are desired. Upgrading from Pro 2 with Lightning to USB-C is generally not worth it (unless you have specific connectivity issues with the Lightning version and use a Vision Pro).
 * AirPods 4: The author strongly recommends AirPods Pro 2 over AirPods 4 due to significantly better noise cancellation and the lack of volume controls on the AirPods 4. The open-ear design of the AirPods 4 results in significant sound leakage and inferior ANC.
TLDR (Apple Intelligence Summary):
The AirPods Pro 2 offer a comfortable design, impressive sound quality, and highly effective noise cancellation.  While the case has some minor issues, the overall experience is excellent.  Upgrading is recommended for users of older AirPods or first-gen AirPods Pro.  The new hearing health features in iOS 18 are a major selling point.  Avoid the AirPods 4 in favor of the Pro 2 unless the in-ear fit is absolutely unbearable.  Upgrading to the USB-C version of the Pro 2 is generally unnecessary."
2025-02-20,"From my experience they are not good at all,You can‚Äôt use Siri and connectivity issues. As of now one of my airpods refuse to connect because I have to update them but its been hours since then and they still don‚Äôt work..i never had a problem with the other airpods pro."
2025-02-25,"Thanks for the detail, I'm considering buying these refurbished when they go down in price"
2025-02-25,"OMG - Are you one of the last remaining humans that can think longer than a Tik Tok or Instagram post? Be very careful, soon you be hunted for having your own, very detailed thoughts. Chemical kosh coming for you!

How dare you write an actual review with comments that may be genuinely useful for someone who is thinking of buying them.

Next time can you please use chat gpt to create something and then ask it to then reduce it to 8 words and post it?"
2025-02-27,I really appreciate the post! Helped me a lotüòÅ
2025-02-28,"I have an unrelated question. How do you return used AirPods, after having opened the packaging and sealing etc? Serious question. I've been wanting to try on some AirPods prior to investing in them, but no stores offer that."
2025-02-28,Recently just got my APP1‚Äôs stolen after having them for 3 years and this convinced me to get the upgrade next month for my birthday. Thanks! Also I don‚Äôt understand the people who are saying the review is long. I think you summed up the points perfectly and I was able to skim through some of your explanations without missing much.
2025-03-01,Do not buy these POS! Not worth a penny of what they charge.
2025-03-04,"hi, i read through the sound quality and i couldn‚Äôt find if you said anything about sound leaks so just wondering if there were any sound leaks when you have it at a moderately high volume"
2025-03-05,"Im having so much connectivity issue with mine, so just using my airpod pro 1 again."
2025-03-13,mine got ran over by a truck and lost in the snow for 2 months and they work and charge the same
2025-03-13,Thank you for the in-depth post:) What I needed
2025-03-14,"man had a great time reading the review and you have convinced me thoroughly, just wondering about two things; can people hear my music if I have it blasted all the way up and will they pop out if im excercising, say playing basketball. thanks"
2025-03-25,"I bought these AirPods maybe a month ago‚Ä¶ my only complaint is when I am on the phone with the AirPods in, I can almost hear myself? Like it‚Äôs like I can hear myself on the other end of the person I‚Äôm talking to‚Ä¶ almost like an echo‚Ä¶? I don‚Äôt know how to describe it but it is SO irritating. I never noticed this with any previous AirPods I owned. I know these AirPods have a setting where when you‚Äôre talking, the music can turn down so you can have a conversation with the AirPods in, but I have this feature turned off. Is anyone else experiencing this? And if so, is there a setting that can be turned off because I currently DESPISE having any phone call with these AirPods in"
2025-03-26,"Look. I had a big concern of whether to upgrade to the AirPods Pro 2 or the AirPods 4 having owned the AirPods Pro 1 for a long time. The AirPods Pro 1 are a very good AirPods but my seller asked me to just test the AirPods Pro 2s and if I did not like then I could return. We did a bet. 

Results: The transparency mode on the AirPods Pro 2 is miles‚Ä¶.miles ‚Ä¶..miles better than the AirPods Pro 1s. For get noise cancelation. These AirPods Pro 2 sit on my ears like I am wearing nothing. 

Another thing. When I was wearing the AirPods Pro 1 with the transparency set in accommodation mode I would bang the car door and want to remove the AirPods. The bang was so loud because of the sensitivity. The AirPods Pro 2s removes that completely.

Finally the hissing that came with transparency is gone.

In short. AirPods Pro 2s are far ‚Ä¶.far better than the AirPods Pro 1s. 

As for the AirPods 4s what I hear is the noise cancellation is not as good as the AirPods Pro 2s. Of course this is the case because they have no proper seal the the ANC algorithm keeps having to work hard to compensate."
2024-11-20,"Jesus, take a breath m8."
2024-11-20,Uhm why
2024-11-20,"I asked ChatGPT to summarize your post and it says ‚Äúit‚Äôs too long, submit something shorter‚Äù"
2024-11-20,Brother post a TLDR. Ain‚Äôt nobody all that.
2024-11-20,I will get in 2 weeks airpods pro 2 type c (lightning is unavilable and i would still get typce c)
2024-11-20,AirPod 4 is better.
2024-11-20,they lwky suck if i‚Äôm being realistic right now
2024-11-20,My exact thoughts even the TLDR is too long
2024-11-20,I hate the fact that I am compelled to make a post that I hate the fact that someone has enough time to write something this long.
2025-01-19,made me self-conscious about my attention span for a second.
2025-02-20,lol redditors are so whiny
2024-11-20,"Yes, check out my profile for the rest of my in depth reviews. But I forgot you people need everything spoon-fed to you in a way that doesn‚Äôt make you do any work whatsoever"
2025-02-17,Are they comfortable for long usage? Say binging a show or listening to music for a long time while studying. Cause I find the pris comfy but when I wear them for a long time my ears start sweating a bit.
2025-02-21,Maybe too late but I bought the nomad leather case at Best Buy like 4 years ago and they aged great
2024-11-21,Past it in chat gpt and ask for the main take away. Or apple intelligence
2025-01-25,have ya'll ever heard of skimming?
2024-12-26,Why would you admit that?
2025-01-07,"TLDR good ANC, Spatial Audio, voice isolation, and sound. Also reliable, good battery and uses USB-C."

2024-11-27,really? that's interesting considering they measure really well. better than pretty much any wireless over-ear ever.
2024-11-20,"Nope, I did use the proofread feature to correct grammar and mistypes. That‚Äôs it though"
2024-11-21,Thank you Garglyballs69 for your productive and insightful comments
2024-11-22,My experience it's like that brand new listening at only 35 percent volume with anc enabled. Sony supposedly gets better life but they have round tips and seem to break more.
2024-12-01,Thank you. Good to know there are still people who are able to read more than a sentence. I‚Äôll make sure next time to upload it in video form with AI reading it over subway surfers
2024-12-26,Thank you for the kind words! So glad it was helpful! Enjoy your AirPods Pro!
2025-01-12,Glad to hear it! I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll love them! And with wireless charging it basically makes the lightning port irrelevant!
2025-03-17,Thanks for reading! Glad it‚Äôs still helping people even months later
2024-11-20,"Thank you lol, I forgot many people are incapable of reading anything longer than a sentence these days"
2024-11-20,"Not to mention, they have the ability to just stop reading and move on. Instead, they spend the time they could have used to read the post or move on to other things to point out that the review was ""too long"" for them.

I personally enjoyed the in-depth review as I was really on the fence about upgrading from the APP1 to APP2."
2024-11-21,"Agreed, it‚Äôs definitely helped me make up my mind about my next purchase! Thanks OP"
2024-11-20,Exactly lol üòÇor if I made a YouTube video instead
2024-11-21,I feel like you stole this from TikTok about a woman doing just that for her husband because her text was too long
2024-11-20,If you read the very first sentence then you‚Äôd know that I offer exactly that at the end

2024-11-21,My firm just updated our laptops and now my AirPod pro 2s always connect! They did not on my old one. I started a thread about it a few years ago on Apples site.

2024-11-24,‚Äú I gave up reading the moment someone said something I disagreed with‚Äù
2024-11-24,"If you don‚Äôt want a detailed review, that‚Äôs fine. Just say you want things spoonfed to you in a way that doesn‚Äôt require any effort or reading comprehension on your part. This whole thread is wild because it just proves most of you haven‚Äôt read a book in years, which is crazyüòÇ"
2024-12-29,"Buy now. They‚Äôre great, and waiting 8 months in hopes of new ones when they aren‚Äôt definitely coming out is ill advised in my opinion"
2025-01-08,"I had that issue on the first gen pros but not on the second, lightning or usbc"
2025-01-22,Can you make a more unnecessary comment???
2025-02-13,"It depends what you want. The AirPods Pro work great as a convenient option to bring with you everywhere and the noise cancellation is very impressive. Now for long flights or when you want an over the ear fit, then over your headphones, like the XM4s might be a good option. But at that point it‚Äôs really up to personal preference in terms of which over ear headphones you prefer. I really like the Bose 700 series headphones, and I know so nice just came out with a pair of headphones that have gotten good reviews. The only ones I wouldn‚Äôt recommend are the AirPods Max because they haven‚Äôt actually been updated in over five years, are way overpriced, and I really just worst in most ways compared to other options. Hope that helps."

2024-11-20,Thank you!

2024-11-20,Great choice! I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll love them!

2025-01-19,Holy shit it's my cake day
2024-11-20,Bruh no one wants to read a book of a review on AirPods
2024-11-20,You‚Äôre on the wrong app my guy ü§£üò≠
2024-11-21,Substack is that way üëâüèª
2024-12-02,"personally love your review man, great information and personal experience that might not be useful to everyone but i still enjoyed reading, sorry for the brain rotted commenters lol"
2025-03-11,"Right bro. You did a great job on the review and idc what any of these bums have to say YOU DID A VERY GOOD JOB THIS. Ima buy these today. Also you‚Äôre right. These smoothed brain, barely formed amoeba want to be spoon fed and never put work in for anything."
2024-11-21,You sound like youre on too high of a dose of adderall
2024-11-21,says the guy that used Apple Intelligence to summarize his dissertation of a post lol.
2025-01-05,"A bit late to that post‚Ä¶ but let me first say thank you for the in-depth review based on your experience. Not sure why you were downvoted‚Ä¶. People, if you can‚Äôt spend 10 minutes reading something.. than the problem is you, not the person who wrote it‚Ä¶ especially when you‚Äôre clicking on a topic that‚Ä¶ supposedly interests you."
2025-03-04,"Okay I know this is all very old, but I just need to say‚Ä¶. No fucking shot people are roasting you for writing up an extremely detailed and comprehensive review of headphones that cost $250?! Like I mean if this review was for like $15 Walmart headphones then maybe I could get on board with saying like‚Ä¶. Hey bro, it‚Äôs not that serious. But this is not an insignificant purchase for many people, and having someone with extensive real world experience with a product laying out pros and cons and giving some insight as to if it may be the right purchase for you on not is extremely valuable. Idk fuck all these idiots, I appreciate your impeccable work done here ü´°"
2025-03-06,"Hey there! Just wanted to say thanks for posting this. I *did* read it all, found it useful, and appreciate the effort you put into it."
2025-02-19,I get what you mean! In general the AirPods Pro 2 are pretty comfortable for long use because of the soft silicone tips. Much better from the Airpods 3 that I had
2025-02-21,"I had other ones before, but after using Vionentus wallets for a year, I switched to their AirPods case as well. Now I can really see the difference from my old case it‚Äôs so much better especially the leather."
2025-01-26,have you ever got someone to talk to?
2024-12-29,Cuz it‚Äôs better than replying to a 40-day old post
2025-01-27,i want to get it just for that LOL
2024-11-27,"yeah that‚Äôs been my experience :), i wont generalize though, but i am also a headphones enthusiast with like 6 pairs of headphones for different occasions and purposes"
2024-11-20,"People read what they find interesting, regardless of length.

It's pretty poor form for an author to blame the reader for their writing being too boring"
2024-11-21,no lol just a common format used for retention span on apps nowadays
2024-11-20,"the AAP2 have a newer chip, and everyone on here universally says the sound is way better , I think maybe my ears are just shot"
2024-11-20,"Surface pro. Audio doesn‚Äôt work on either teams or Google meet.

Gone through the support and it‚Äôs a dead end, just an issue with the Bluetooth, noise cancellation and the way teams and meet work."
2024-11-28,"I mean I‚Äôm currently a full time college student about to be doing post grad work, I spend most of my week reading shit way more complicated than your shitty AirPods review lol. I think you just want something to argue about online man. Either way you‚Äôre being rude as fuck to people for no reason. I‚Äôm sorry if there‚Äôs something going on in your life that is hard or if somebody has hurt you in some way, I hope things get better man‚Ä¶"
2025-01-23,Cry
2024-11-21,Never learned to read. My bad.
2024-11-21,Some things aren't worth reading.
2024-11-20,It‚Äôs true. Bro even said 3 paragraphs was too long.
2024-11-22,"Then what would you like the review to say ""*It iz good, buy now*"".  Some folks like long form reviews.  It takes skill to give a detailed breakdown and cover things a consumer would want to know.

The mighty short attention span will doom our species."
2025-02-01,"agreed. if you don't want the details, the conclusions are at the bottom. if you actually want to investigate all the claims about the product, OP provided them! obviously, care went into this review. not sure why that would bother a potential customer. again, if you don't want to read it, don't. no one's holding a gun to your head"
2024-12-30,That reply makes no sense.
2024-11-27,i have a few myself haha
2024-11-21,"""am i so out of touch? No...its the children who are wrong."""
2024-11-20,"ahh, good point, mea culpa."
2024-11-28,"Argue online? Bitch you‚Äôre the one who came at me lol, and if you‚Äôre doing such important work and your time is so important that you can‚Äôt be bothered, then shouldn‚Äôt you be doing that instead of browsing the AirPods Pro subreddit and arguing with strangers online? I‚Äôm just existing and you decided to be adversarial. Don‚Äôt twist it"
2024-11-21,But are worth commenting. Tiktok brainers logic :D
2024-11-21,"It's too long for what it is. 3 paragraphs of an interesting story is nothing and I'd happily read it. 

3 paragraphs of a review from someone I don't know for a TLDR is boring and a waste of my time"
2025-02-21,"Yeah long form is fine, and yes we do have a short attention span. But THIS IS JUST POOR WRITING. The dude uses like 3 long sentences to convey a single, simple thought. It‚Äôs fluff."
2025-01-01,cuz yours dont
2025-01-07,Huh?
2024-11-29,Ive had my pro 2s for two years and love them. I have other high end pairs and the Pro 2 dominates them
2024-11-29,"Go try the Pro2 at an Apple Store, you will love the clarity and the bass, instrument separation is fantastic too. No comparison. But the pro2, you won‚Äôt regret it. Invest in yourself!"
2024-11-29,"Just got them. I like them so far, but I got them for a good deal in the states $153, as there are holiday sales going on now. I‚Äôm not sure how much I would like them for $100 more. When you say ‚Äúare they worth it‚Äù it‚Äôs hard to say. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd spend my last $250 on them. But as an upgrade over the AirPod Gen3, which I‚Äôve been using for a while, I‚Äôd say they are ‚Äúworth‚Äù it."
2024-11-29,"I use mine all the time, and prefer the gen 2 to the gen 1. the main feature I appreciate with the newer pair is the volume adjustment on the AirPods themselves. Super handy that I never have to pull out my phone at all to skip/rewind or adjust volume.  
However, if you only have an iPhone (no watch, iPad or Mac), then there might be other cheaper alternatives."
2024-11-29,"Yes. I have 3 sets. I bought my first set when they came out. Bought a second set just to leave at work. Then a third when the usbc models dropped. They all work great. My original set has some battery degradation, they aren‚Äôt terrible but I use them constantly so with that being considered, they‚Äôve been fantastic. I‚Äôll prob never buy another brand again. I don‚Äôt like over the ear headphone, so with everything as a package, for in ears, app2‚Äôs are def worth it"
2024-11-29,Depends on the amount of money you have but I see the value proposition. It‚Äôs become to me a ‚Äúmust-have‚Äù. I wouldn‚Äôt buy if I was tight with money though.
2024-11-29,Yes
2024-11-30,"I have them and a whole bunch of other earbuds. They are worth the money only if you need the transparency mode/ hearing aid or if you really need VERY good ANC. In any other scenario, no, they are not worth the money. In my case , I'm using the CMF buds pro 2 connected to both my phones and the experience is excellent. OnePlus buds 3/3 pro could be another excellent option (a bit more costly tho). Search scarbir on Google"
2024-11-29,Got it for $129 worth every pennies.
2024-11-30,"Yes, absolutely yes."
2024-11-30,Yes they are definitely worth the money. Even just for the noise cancelation. Even without music you can just tune out at work or on a plane - they are great quality- and especially worth it if you already have an iphone/apple ecosystem. That said the Bose Ultra Quietcomfort II earbuds are even better - no joke
2024-11-29,Absolutely not. Their initial firmware is great. Unbelievable noise cancelling. Then they will update themselves and become essentially useless. Do not buy AirPods
2024-11-29,"I just bought mine but waiting to pick them up. From what I have read and heard, it‚Äôs a noticeable difference from Pro 1."
2024-11-29,"I picked them up for 170‚Ç¨, they are alright for this price... I guess. For 289‚Ç¨, I don't think so"
2024-11-29,"I‚Äôll be honest, coming from AirPods 3 they were a LOT better than I expected. Make sure you use the correct tips for you and they should sound superb for their size. I absolutely love them and never really use my AirPods Max now."
2024-11-29,"I got mine not too long ago.

Honestly, I'm iffy about them, just personally speaking.

The noise cancellation on the first gen was SO MUCH BETTER than these with their weird Active Noise Cancelation.  
With the first gens, I bought them at a Best Buy and tried them out there and it completely canceled all the noise from the busy environment, it Actually kinda blew me away at the time.

I Just bought the Air pod pro 2 recently, and it just doesn't seem like it cancels ANY noise at all, even with both air pods in and full noise canceling active. But maybe I'm just in a louder environment than I was before, so I'm fine just sitting on the fence about that one.

The one MAJOR gripe I have is that they just simply hurt my ears.  
I have no idea what exactly it is, but I've tried every single tip large to small, including aftermarket tips and they just hurt my ear and I can't tell why.  
The air pod pros, I used the smallest ear tip and they fit PERFECTLY so much that I'd fully forget I was wearing headphones at times, especially with the Listen Through feature.



But the air pod pro 2? I stg I can feel the irritation on my ears after less than half an hour.



If I could go back in time, I'd 100% get the first gen air pod pros all over again.



I've had:  
Air pods, Air pod first to 4th gen, and air pod pro 1st and 2nd gen, and the first gen air pod pro was by far the Best out of all of them, in terms of sound quality and comfort. 



tldr2nd gen sounds GREAT, the ANC is \*\*okay\*\* at best but that's whatever to me.  
But they just HURT my ear and I could never figure out why."
2024-11-29,"If you like the in ear with tips go for it they are fabulous, if you don‚Äôt like the fitted tips go for the ordinary AirPods (I had gen3, not tried gen4)"
2024-11-29,"I‚Äôve had the AirPods Pro 2 for a while, and tbh, they‚Äôre great if you care about noise canceling and sound quality. The transparency mode is super natural too. But if you‚Äôre not using those features daily, there might be cheaper options that still sound good."
2024-11-29,In the UK / US they are on sale now for like ¬£140-160
2024-11-29,No guarantee but my original pros are 4 years old this Christmas and going strong - except for one incident where the case broke entirely and wouldn‚Äôt connect. That was fixed by smacking it on a desk. Hopefully these are as durable which might mean you can consider it price/lifespan $per year
2024-11-29,"Apple gear is expensive but it‚Äôs great quality. A bit overpriced, but great."
2024-11-29,Use my 2‚Äôs all the time amazing invention! Use mine all the time. ANC is unreal
2024-11-29,Getting mine tomorrow. God bless Black Friday üòÇ
2024-11-29,"Absa-effing-lutely

They are solid. Second best gadget/tech I have ever purchased in my 35 years as a techie.

290 euro seems steep though? I got mine on sale for 175 british pounds"
2024-11-29,"Bro, it is worthy to say that AirPods Pro 2 is an absolute beast! One of the best product out there! I use AirPods Pro as a Hearing Aids, although, I‚Äôm soon going to buy an actual Hearing Aids again, but this AirPods Pro blows my mind with the Active Noise Cancellation and the Hearing Aids (note that Hearing Aids isn‚Äôt made for severe hearing loss). Also, my AirPods Pro 2 last 6hrs 20mins which is crazy but still not good because I use this as a hearing aids so I want them to be 12hrs of Battery Life :/"
2024-11-29,I have pro 2s and love them. I had the pro 1s before though and I can‚Äôt tell the difference between them other than a couple minor features. I‚Äôd get them if you don‚Äôt have any pros but I would spend the money upgrading if you already have the 1s
2024-11-29,They work great with Apple TV
2024-11-29,Yup! Also get AppleCare+! Just got a whole new set of pros for free! Battery replacements! Still 4 months of AppleCare left! Delivered on black Friday no less!
2024-11-29,"Got my pro 2 today and damn their good, fits good I my ear (even when running) compared to my EarPods, and the sound is amazing."
2024-11-30,"Def do it now if you‚Äôre gonna, got mine off a target circle for 129"
2024-11-30,I have the first version as well but they developed a rattle after a couple of years so I bought a pair. No regrets. The first version is still good but version two are great.
2024-11-30,Absolutely.
2024-11-30,"Yes they are worth it. To preface what Im going to say next, I want to say that I have dropped my AirPods a lot, overcharged them, and dropped water on one of them, they withstood most of these actions. I had the AirPods Pro for 4 years now and I‚Äôm only replacing them because the charging case doesn‚Äôt hold much battery and one AirPod doesn‚Äôt have good sound compared to the other AirPod"
2024-11-30,Yah they‚Äôre rly good. I just got sm called nothing ear from work and they‚Äôre cool but I still use the AirPods bc they have better transparency and noice cancellation. Like music sounds a little better on the other ones but I I still like the AirPods better
2024-11-30,"I have the pro 2s since a week now and I am more than excited! They fit perfectly without disturbing me in any way, even after some hours it doesn‚Äôt hurt my ears even a bit. And I don‚Äôt have the feeling they could fall out of my ears. If the transparency mode is activated (and the music is not too loud) the surrounding can be heard very clear, if noise cancellation is activated voices and noises around me are nearly completely faded out. Really amazing!
The sound quality blew me away! Very clear, very precise and an impressive bass. I had a couple of different earphones but the pro 2s are playing in a totally different league. I never would have thought that they‚Äòd thrilled me that much.

Isn‚Äôt there a way that you buy them from another country where you can get them much cheaper?"
2024-11-30,"My pair just survived a wash AND dry cycle, which my previous non-Pro ones did not, I‚Äôm amazed."
2024-11-30,"So I have been using Liberty Pro 3s for a couple of years and have had my eye on Air Pod Pros for a few years but could never justify the cost. I also recently got them on an open box sale for ¬£154.

I would say that anyone point is amazing. To be honest I expected amazing noise cancellation but I would say it‚Äôs not that much better than a liberty pro 3 but it is noticeable. Sound quality as well is good but not overwhelming. But what does it for me is they just work. I have an Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad and Apple TV. It works with everything. The adaptive noise cancelling and then just normal noise cancellation but notices when you speak it lowers it if you are talking to someone. Saying hey siri with no button press. List goes on and on that they are just better. Not a single amazing feature but overall the simple ease and functionality are unbeatable."
2024-11-30,"I have never used airpod pro2, but airpod 4 anc was mind blowing. I think airpods pro 2 has a better feature/noice cancelling, so yes it will be worth every penny.

the biggest difference i found between pro2 and airpod 4 anc is noise cancellation, really, and maybe volume control."
2024-11-30,So you come to the airpods subreddit to ask if the top of the line buds are worth it? lmfao
2024-11-30,I love them. I also have an Apple Watch. I hate the watch.
2024-11-30,"I‚Äôve had them for 1-2 years I love them with my 13 pm
* Plan on getting the AirPods Max for the iPhone 16 pm

Only negative is the noise cancellation is heavily dependent on your silicone fit. 
* Too small and they hurt my ears though. Never something I think about at a 7am bus ride but if it‚Äôs jam packed like going to an airport. 

I think a bigger one with 30h battery time would be better. 
* I‚Äôm somewhere between 3-6h battery until I need a 15 min charge to get through the rest of my day.

Pretty sure black week has some good prices under 200$ to look around"
2024-11-30,"bro mine actually suck. I thought I was upgrading from the beats fit pros, and it‚Äôs a downgrade. the only thing that‚Äôs better is the nodding/shaking your head to answer prompts, and it has a better transparency mode. it‚Äôs crisper. WHEN IT WORKS!!!!! But 90% of the time when using transparency mode, it starts to skip the music, then disconnects. Can‚Äôt even go 10 minutes without it happening. If noise cancellation is on it‚Äôs fine, but i‚Äôd rather have some awareness while walking. 

Long story short they‚Äôre glitchy. REALLY glitchy. There‚Äôs actually a lawsuit you can look up. Go the beats route they‚Äôre 98% as good (although I like bass so the sound quality I enjoy more), and in 2 years it‚Äôs never glitched out on me. I find myself using those more. They fit better too.

rant over."
2024-11-30,"Yea sound quality is 9/10 
Sweat proof 
& you can adjust volume from the earbud itself"
2024-11-30,"As someone who paid 250 USD for my AirPods, I can say they are definitely some of the best sounding earbuds I‚Äôve ever used, and if you use Apple Music and leverage spatial audio as well as spatial audio on Netflix, it‚Äôs a game changer‚Ä¶ Also kind of cool to be able to nod my phone to answer phone calls or shake my head not to decline them. That‚Äôs fun."
2024-11-30,For $160. There are no better ones
2024-11-30,They are on sale at Walmart for 160cdn
2024-11-30,They‚Äôre outstanding. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll beat them for the money.
2024-11-30,"I have Gen 1 still. 
I do hear static noises here and there. 
But I‚Äôm still going to use it"
2024-11-30,They‚Äôre my least used pair. Hurt my ears and slip with minimal exercise or movement. They get bumped and have too much grip on my ear. Now the noise cancelling and crackling is back to being shit after I already replaced the pods themselves after only having them about 6 months. When they work they are the best sound from an ear bud. But it‚Äôs not worth the drawbacks at that price in my opinion. I‚Äôm getting the 4‚Äôs with anc for Christmas and it‚Äôs nice because I have been waiting for that hardware pretty much since the pros came out.
2024-11-30,"289‚Ç¨ üò≥ 
Are you by any chance from üáπüá∑?"
2024-11-30,"I just upgraded my APP to the Pro 2 and I can say the Surround Dolby thing sounds way better, the Adaptive is impressively good. I have a loud sports care and in adaptive turns it down by 40% which is crazy. Also more base slightly than the last version. Overall I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth the money on sale"
2024-11-30,I just got them last week for $288 aud and ive used them everyday and love them so worth it
2024-11-30,If you have an iPhone and are looking for earbuds then AirPods Pro 2 are a no brainer! Especially with all the sales on right now
2024-11-30,"Pro: Sound stage is amazing ( clarity even at the highest volume . 
Amazing ANC . 
Great battery life.
Seemless integration with other apple device.
Compact size ( use a case once u get it as it will get scratched easily in your pocket ) .

Cons : none for me so far ( using for more than a year) .
PS: also if you don‚Äôt need anc u can consider buying the wired apple headphones, I use the usb c one and barring anc it‚Äôs as good as app2 in my opinion ."
2024-11-30,"I‚Äôm 67 so my ears don‚Äôt work the best.  I absolutely love my pro 2‚Äôs.  I use them for zoom calls all work day long.  Then to watch the tele at night. Weekends tune up some tunes.  I love all the modes, transparency, noise cancellation and adaptive.  I‚Äôve even started using them as a hearing aid when I‚Äôm physically present for meetings.  They have yet to disappoint me.  Best money I‚Äôve spent.   They switch flawlessly between the iPhone, iPad and MacBook."
2024-11-30,Love them although not happy that apple upgraded the standard airpods and not come out with an even better pro version.  Yep love me pro 2s - I also own apple pro max over head earphones but the very best for noise cancellation is Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Headphones
2024-11-30,yes they are 100% worth it. i love mine
2024-11-30,I just bought a pair and I‚Äôm loving them so far. Coming from a dead pair of Jabra Elite 75t wireless earbuds that stopped holding a charge after 4 years of abuse.
2024-11-30,"289‚Ç¨ is a lot for a product with a 2 year old chip. The AirPods Pro are due an upgrade and Pro 3 could come out mid 2025. I would wait and buy that. 
Now if you‚Äôre getting a deal on Black Friday and are getting it for under 200 I would say go for it."
2024-11-30,I just bought them after holding out for years because I have perfectly good jabra earbuds. I will say the seamless integration with iPhone makes it so worth it!!! Totally locked into the Apple ecosystem now though
2024-11-30,I got them last Xmas and am blown away by the sound and the functionality if you use an iPhone. IOS 18.1 introduced a hearing aid feature which is really interesting if you are older or have hearing loss.
2024-11-30,"Yes, I bought pro 1at launch, bought pro 2 at launch, last year. Now Target (US) sell pro 2 for $128, I bought extra two for my family."
2024-11-30,"I  bought them a couple of days ago, but already tested them thoroughly. They are phenomenal, music and podcasts sound very good and calls tell me that I am heard perfectly. I live in a big city and last night I ran for two hours in the middle of the city (very noisy environment due to traffic and many people) and I could hear the music perfectly (Pink Floyd) at low volume, it seemed like it was the middle of the night when the city is sleeping and there is no one around, when in reality it was rush hour. Same thing at work, very noisy, here I can only use one earphone (I listened to several podcasts) also in this case perfect, they allow you to listen to the entire podcast perfectly at low volume, narration voice always crystal clear. bought with Black Friday ... exceptional"
2024-11-30,"100% - recently went swimming with them in my shorts pocket out the case, then sauna and then rinse shower and they still worked fine. Beast in ear headphones/buds ever built."
2024-11-30,"hell yea, the modes are so useful especially transparency. Though you have to be careful not to get then too dirty cause the quality will diminish."
2024-11-30,After owning samsung buds sony xm4 earbuds and then AirPods pro 2 is the best i ever owned specially if you have tiny ear like me just but it you wont regret .
2024-11-30,"Keep them clean tho, I just replaced my right airpod pro for 118$ after 2 years of use."
2024-11-30,I recently upgraded from my AirPods Pro 2 Lightning to USB-C ones. Can't have it any other way. They're indispensable for me.
2024-11-30,"i have them, they‚Äôre okay if it isn‚Äôt windy, because the mics pick it up and amplify it like 5x whether nc is active or not"
2024-11-30,"Yep they‚Äôre amazing, have had them for 2 years now"
2024-11-30,They are worth the money but 290EUR is a bit too much at this point. Is there any way you can get somebody to get them to you from another EU country? They‚Äôre 173EUR on amazon.de at the moment.
2024-11-30,Well I‚Äòm convinced they‚Äòre worth the money alone for the ANC already. I consider them crucial for using public transportation and give me the chills even in crowded situations. I just love them because of this.
2024-11-30,It's the best Apple product literally for me
2024-11-30,"I bought mine a couple of weeks ago while it was on sale  (at a local store) and the experience so far has been satisfactory.

PROS: The ANC is decent (although sometimes it‚Äôs a hit or miss at certain places) and the audio quality when listening to music is amazing. The main reason I love it is because of its auto device switching feature, it works like a charm when you‚Äôre switching between Apple devices at a time. 

CONS: Mic quality is horrendous if you‚Äôre not in a silent room. It just got worse in the recent firmware update (btw you don‚Äôt have a choice to upgrade or not, they force it on you) 

All and all I‚Äôd say purchase it ONLY if it‚Äôs on sale. I can‚Äôt justify paying full price for it because of some of the cons."
2024-11-30,"Yes !! And Amazon has them on sale for $153 right now this very moment - bought them 2 days ago & there brand new , non refurbished air pod pro 2 h2 chip 

Sold by Amazon 

Deff worth it , and almost $100 off for Black Friday - cop them 

https://a.co/d/b8oSjVX"
2024-11-30,Yup
2024-11-30,"Is there no Black Friday deal now?

I wouldn‚Äôt pay 289 but if you can find them around the 200 tag I‚Äôd say go for it. Bought them on September two years ago and it‚Äôs the product I‚Äôve been happiest with and use every freaking single day"
2024-11-30,They are amazing honestly‚Ä¶joined the club recently and I am a big fan.
2024-11-30,"Definitely worth it. I had the AirPods Pro 1 since 2019 and was happy with them. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt think the Pro 2 would be much different. But last week, I bought the Pro 2 because it was on sale, and oh my gosh, the difference is like night and day! 

The sound on the Pro 2 is so much better‚Äîit feels like I‚Äôm using a completely different pair of headphones!"
2024-11-30,YES
2024-11-30,"I have them but prefer the AirPod 4 with active noise canceling, the noise canceling is better on the pros but the sacrifice in noise canceling is worth it for the improvement in comfort on the 4s for me. I just say this to point out ear shape can be a factor, as the pro  for me don‚Äôt fit as well and are less comfortable."
2024-11-30,They‚Äôre great but the battery life is pretty poor compared to my Powerbeats Pro
2024-12-01,they‚Äôre‚Ä¶something‚Ä¶ but nice for commutes. still prefer my over ear headphones but the ap2 are great for noise cancelling etc
2024-12-01,"Yes if you have an iPhone full stop. Everything is straight forward and the anc is really really good. I already saw that some people are bringing up specific headphones that have better anc. Yes it‚Äôs not the best but you will feel weird the first time you turn on anc.  No good way to explain but they also sound really good for wireless iems. 

I don‚Äôt understand why Reddit is so hateful"
2024-12-01,"If you like the gummies that stick out of the part that sound comes out of, yes. Otherwise go for a different model.

One obnoxious thing is that you have to adjust the volume of notifications every time you want to use them vs not use them. If you always have your phone on vibrate, this isn‚Äôt an issue, but for someone who normally has text message notification volume on 100% // or alarm volume on 100%, if you forget to change it when putting your earbuds in, you will definitely get hearing loss problems.

Another issue is that once dust, dirt or earwax gets into the mesh, it is impossible to clean it out. Over time, it will affect the sound and your only choice to have crisp audio again will be to get new ones.¬†

If your mind is set on getting some, you can get them way cheaper online. 289‚Ç¨ is way too expensive. I got some yesterday for $160. Try shopping Apple‚Äôs online store or Best Buy‚Äôs store, especially on Cyber Monday. Idk if your country acknowledges Cyber Monday but you can always try getting it shipped from America for cheaper, I can‚Äôt imagine overseas charges would add up to more than what you say it costs over there."
2024-12-01,Love them! Having them for I think a year and a half now and work totally fine! üíñ‚ú® get them with the BF sales!
2025-03-25,I bought mine a couple of weeks ago and I just returned them today. There is no difference from the first one to the second one.
2024-11-30,Get airpods 4 the are better and cheaper
2024-11-29,"Nah, honestly if you aren‚Äôt in a place to get good sales ( Black Friday in the US) you should go for the AirPod gen 4‚Äôs with noise cancellation. Pros are crazy good but I like my Gen 4‚Äôs better ( parents have the pro 2‚Äôs). Only main difference is the ear tips which seals a lot more sound in and prevents a lot more sound from getting in. I don‚Äôt like that feature though, it makes my ears feel a little too plugged, whereas the gen 4 AirPods with noise cancellation have pretty good ANC, but they feel more sleek and better fitting for me."
2024-11-29,"Nope, I'm not happy with the sound quality. The ""gadgets"" in them are nice, but I'm interested in the sound and should be way better for the price tag"
2024-11-30,Dominates them how?

2024-11-29,Thank you
2024-11-30,"I've went through 4 airpods pros first gen and second gens and they always end up breaking(ANC, transparency making a noise and battery life becomes worthless). For how much they go for, it's safe to say plastic doesn't cost 260 euros and using last gen 5.3 bluetooth, i'd expect them to use 6.0 bluetooth and to top that all of no multipoint and no codecs."
2024-11-29,I dont have any airpods yet
2024-11-30,"I got them at 180 cad so roughly 128 usd brand hew and I would still be quite happy to pay more because of how good the battery life, sound, noise cancellation is compared to the previous gen"
2024-11-30,"Since you use it all the time, how are you not worried about getting ear damage? Do you have some safety measures turned on?"
2024-11-29,I have a watch and iphone but nothing else
2024-11-29,So after 2 years they are still really good?
2024-12-01,"I had some sort of static noise with mine instantly right out of the package doesnt matter which mode i was on, decided to give them back, i assume thats normal? Even tough ive seen many complaints online"
2024-11-30,How‚Äôd you get that price?
2024-11-29,from where?
2024-11-29,I dont have any airpods yet so If im gonna buy any I want the best so I can have them for a long time
2024-11-29,Wow thats all good to know. I cant find airpods 1 anywhere are they not selling them anymore? I also never had noise cancelation so I wont really see how better the first ones were. I am worried about my ears hurting but the basic ones I have tried from friends and they dont stay in my ears so I think this would be a better option. I dont know what I will do I have never had any airpods so Im still thinking about it. Thank you for all of this info
2025-02-23,Airpods pro 2 are literally the same outer shell as the airpod pro 1. Did you get some fake 2s?
2024-11-29,I do like the fitted tips the ordinary I have tried from a friend and they just dont stay in my ears
2024-11-29,I do want them mostly for those options I have never had any good ones with any type of noise canceling and I would really like that
2024-11-29,Who sells them for ¬£140?
2024-11-29,Im not from US or UKüòî

2024-11-29,I would get 4‚Äôs without thinking if all of those originals didnt fall out of my ear üòû
2024-11-30,"Better sound, ANC, spacial"
2024-12-05,Yeah
2024-11-30,"The AirPods Pro (2nd generation) were released on September 23, 2022."
2024-11-30,You're talking about the re-release with usb C port
2024-11-30,"Valid point! No, when I say I use them all the time it‚Äôs more that I use them daily during commutes and such - not literally all the time!  
I also use the noice threshold to avoid blasting my ears at full volume - and so far I am doing excellent on my yearly health checks, which also include hearing health. I‚Äôm glad you brought this up, though, more people should be aware of how using headphones regularly without afterthought could impact their hearing!"
2024-11-30,"Then there might be cheaper alternatives if you‚Äôre on a budget. They are still great, and as far as I‚Äôm aware you could use only pre-downloaded stuff on the watch (or streamed if you have the eSIM-edition)."
2024-11-29,"Yeah, sound is still perfect. There is some battery loss on the pods themselves, haven‚Äôt noticed on the case but it‚Äôs not bad. They charge so fast though, it‚Äôs really not an issue. I haven‚Äôt compared side by side either though. All in all, they‚Äôre still great"
2024-11-30,"I only just bought some on sale for about ‚Ç¨180 as my AirPods Pro died after about a year, and Apple hasn‚Äôt accepted responsibility to replace them despite the other recall they‚Äôve done of AirPods Pro. I had gone back to my old AirPods and unless you really need noise cancelling or other special ‚Äòpro‚Äô features, I‚Äôm not convinced that an amount over ‚Ç¨250 is worth it compared with the Beats that I love!"
2024-11-30,If you have target account or credit card with them you‚Äôll get even cheaper. They currently have coupons if you spend $150 you‚Äôll get $25 off.
2024-11-29,It was a short lived Black Friday deal from one of the main mobile network operators in my country
2024-11-29,Then get the pro 2s fs
2024-11-29,Costco have a Black Friday deal on for ¬£159. Haven't seen them cheaper
2024-11-30,it was on sale from amazon until two weeks ago for $180 (\~¬£140)
2024-11-30,Whaat?! Wow. ¬£50 for me. ¬£229 to ¬£179
2024-11-29,"Wow okay fair enough, I mean they are good but maybe there is some alternative in your country that offers same quality for cheaper price? Sony?

Do you use iPhone as well?"
2024-11-29,"No problem! Make sure to check out the latest deal, unfortunately, I‚Äôm in US so I got AirPods Pro with AppleCare+ in just $199. As of now, Black Friday deals made it even crazy, going low as $154 on Amazon and Target, although you‚Äôre not from US so that‚Äôs a bad luck for you! üò≠"
2024-11-30,I‚Äôd say get them for sure. I love mine
2024-11-30,That‚Äôs way way too much! ü§Ø
2024-11-30,"Lol no way. 

Sony MX5s have much better ANC, spatial and sound. 

AirPods have better integration with iPhones but that‚Äôs about it."
2024-11-30,I‚Äôm seeing them for $169.99 right now. Hmmm
2024-11-29,Germany?
2024-11-29,I will look into that thank you
2024-11-29,"Yes I use Iphone
I was looking into some alternatives but idk I will check what else is there for sure before I buy"
2024-11-29,Yess If I had those deals I wouldnt be thinking about it I would just buy themüòÇ
2024-11-30,You‚Äôre comparing over the ear headphones with ear buds. It‚Äôs not exactly a fair comparison
2024-11-30,"I agree, the Sonys sound 1000 times better!! I have a lot of pairs of tws and frankly my AirPods Pro 2 are just for calls on the go, videos are everything when it comes to music the wf1000xm5 are way ahead for me the best ANC, I use them in anc at the gym, the passive anc is so excellent! The sound is Sony, very well managed no matter the style chosen and very open! 

Everyone knows that the AirPods Pro 2 sound much better without anc without spatial audio (more natural) but it remains generic, very well integrated into the Apple ecosystem"
2024-11-30,"I also have Bose QCU‚Äôs an Sennheiser true sport which sound really good, but the Pro 2‚Äôs just sound better"
2024-11-29,You‚Äôre welcome
2024-11-30,It‚Äôs changed few hours ago.
2024-11-30,Walmart has them for $154
2024-11-29,cheers mate
2024-11-29,"Yeah come up with a shortlist of options, maybe if there is something much cheaper.

Otherwise if there isn't then yeah these earphones are very good choice for iPhone users"
2024-11-29,Gotcha! ü§ì
2024-11-30,"No, I‚Äôm comparing Sony earbuds with Apple earbuds. 

Bose earbuds also have better ANC and arguably better sound.

2024-11-30,"Bah, that was my fear! I‚Äôll keep watching it in case it drops again. Enjoy your new pair!"
2024-11-30,You can price match and use $25 off for $150. If you register the account from Target.
2024-11-30,When I looked up Sony xm5‚Äôs all I found were the over the ear ones. Had to specifically add earbuds to the search for them to pop up. You right
2024-11-30,My airlods have always had better anc at the gym
2025-02-14,https://www.soundguys.com/airpods-pro-3-wait-124219/
2024-11-30,Yup. Check in Amazon its still in same price $154
2024-11-30,You ain‚Äôt google hard enough..
2025-02-15,lol ok
2025-02-15,So the guy you mention says they are the best (he owns it)
2025-02-16,He does not. He says they ‚Äúcan keep up‚Äù.
2024-05-05,pro gen 2 are worth it for me. sound cancelling is much better
2024-05-05,If you liked gen 1 you‚Äôll love gen 2. If you didn‚Äôt like gen 1 gen 2 probably won‚Äôt convince you.
2024-05-05,"Yes. I have the original AirPod Pros and there are some significant upgrades. 

Especially the tracking feature"
2024-05-05,YES!!! The noise canceling on these is amazing. My partner snores like a freight train and I can‚Äôt hear him at all with these in. WORTH EVERY PENNY!
2024-05-05,There incredible sound so so good
2024-05-05,I just went to a concert and these adaptive audio mode changed my life forever.
2024-05-06,Wait and see what the 2024 ones look like. They are supposed to a be a total overhaul
2024-05-05,"Yes, yes and hell yes. I had the gen 1s and upgraded to the 2s. The noise cancelling was already excellent, and these are even better."
2024-05-05,Tips are basically the same material but they do come in with different sizes to change them . I really like the adaption to sound.
2024-05-05,"Any generation AirPod Pro is 10000% better than any generation AirPod due to the tips. The difference the tips make is unreal. I would take a Gen 1 AirPod Pro over the latest AirPod any day of the week. There‚Äôs just no comparison in terms of comfort, fit, how well they stay in your ears (and thus how often you lose them), and sound quality.

On the other hand, AirPod Pro gen 3 is 1% better than AirPod Pro gen 1‚Äôs. I‚Äôve never succeeded in getting the side volume slider to work correctly. If you can use an AirPod Pro instead of an Airpod, always choose that option. But which version of the AirPod Pro you use does not matter. The only nice thing about the Gen 3 over Gen 2 is the USB-C connection instead of Lightning, and the only nice thing about the Gen 2 over Gen 1 is that it sticks to magnetic charging stations better (thus making which port it uses to charge irrelevant)

Try different tips. SpinDrift makes tips for AirPod Pros that come in more sizes and are more comfortable."
2024-05-05,Mine have the Problem that about half a year after buying them (directly from apple) the left earbud is significantly more quiet then the right one and I've seen no solution to fix it so far :(
2024-05-06,If the tips don‚Äôt work for you you can buy third party tips made of different materials. They‚Äôre worth it for sure either way
2024-05-06,If it‚Äôs on sale in your country definitely get it! I lost my older pair so I recently got the second gen. There are also additional settings
2024-05-06,"Worth every single penny, even at full price! I don‚Äôt know how I can fly without them, the noise cancelling feature is phenomenal üí™"
2024-05-06,"I got a pair recently to replace my original ones, and the ability to adjust the volume and activate the different modes makes them so worth it. My one gripe is that I don't really like the rubber nubs, I prefer the feel of a solid plastic piece. Had I known I would have definitely gotten a pair without the rubber ear nubs."
2024-05-06,"Bro i just got mine today because my left gen 1AirPods Pro started with crackling and white noise so I decided to upgrade to gen 2 and the sound quality is much better, also noise canceling and transparency modes are way better than Gen 1. Totally worth it"
2024-05-06,"Yes, but still a bit overpriced, at least in India it is the case."
2024-05-06,"I bought this 4 months ago and used it when working out , now the charging connectors have rust and even if it‚Äôs in warranty they won‚Äôt repair or replace the product. When I make calls my I have to adjust it a little bit so the other end can hear my voice. For me it‚Äôs a risky product if it works it works great but without good service and warranty this can easily become an expensive mistake like it feels for me."
2024-05-05,"Stick to the 3, my son got the pro 1 and didn‚Äôt fit me well and bought the 3 which are perfect. Now the pro 1 are busted and he got the pro 2, tested them last week and are the exact same fit as 1."
2024-05-05,Nope. Had mine for a year before they started doing the loud crackle static sound which physically hurt my ears. Tossing them was the best decision I could have made pertaining to them
2024-05-05,yes
2024-05-05,"Can‚Äôt get them to stay in my ears. Try end so many after market plugs. Dunno, my ears don‚Äôt like ear buds. I folded and went for the over ear apple headset. I way prefer everything about those ."
2024-05-05,I upgraded from Gen 1 and I‚Äôm absolutely blown away.
2024-05-05,Kinda ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  now your getting them for the apple ecosystem. For about half of the price you can get nothing a2 with the same specs. They also break easily. So I wouldnt buy them in 2024
2024-05-05,"I recently switched and yes, definitely!"
2024-05-05,"Best in ears concerning sound quality, they can even keep up with some better over ears. They are absolutely worth it, especially with the very good noise canceling snd the adaptive transparency they are a dream to use."
2024-05-05,"You can get custom made tips for the Pros that are made based on a scan from a audiometrist (is that the correct word for those people who make hearing aids?)

Quite pricey and I don‚Äôt have one of those, but might be worth having a look at it"
2024-05-05,"Yes, especially if you can get them for $179 or $189. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd pay full price for them seeing gen 3 will be out in the fall but if you can get them on sale (Amazon or Best Buy regularly have them for the prices I mentioned) then absolutely."
2024-05-05,Smokey!
2024-05-06,"Yes the transparency adaptive and the conversation detection makes it similar to the experience of wearing bone conduction headphones while blocking out unwanted noise.
While it‚Äôs not the same you can add a silicone cover with eartips to regular AirPods. But you won‚Äôt get transparency and anc and you have to take them on and off to charge"
2024-05-06,Loved the noise canceling in gen 2s but what surprised me the most is the adaptive transparency mode. Its so good
2024-05-06,Definitely worth it if you cool enough
2024-05-06,With 126 ms latency? Certainly worth it if you have money.
2024-05-06,Yeah imo. My wife has the Pro Max headphones and these have like 90% the same audio quality and noise cancelling (probably better noise cancelling if I‚Äôm being honest) at half the price. And they‚Äôre just really convenient to carry around.
2024-05-06,They are worth it. I wouldn‚Äôt have bothered to answer this thread if they weren‚Äôt.
2024-05-06,Absolutely. I work construction and the noise cancelling is perfect. The noise reduction is also incredible. I run that 80% of the time. It compresses loud sounds but I can still hear my guys.
2024-05-06,"Went from samsung buds 2 to airpods pro 2 gen usb. Sound quality is neck and neck, but noice cancelation is on another level."
2024-05-06,"I bought my 2nd gen pair because I lost my 1st gen pair, then I found my 1st gen pair :/ haven‚Äôt noticed too much of a difference"
2024-05-06,I love my gen 2 I‚Äôd buy them again if I needed to
2024-05-06,depends on ear
2024-05-06,"Absolutely , I just got some 2 weeks ago and don‚Äôt regret it one bit. That noise cancellation is amazing and always comes in clutch. Don‚Äôt even get me started on the Spatial Audio, all tho I think the AirPod gen 3 also has it. Transparency is also insanely good if you care about that"
2024-05-06,"I find these so uncomfortable, pros were a good investment"
2024-05-06,"Excellent Pods, I use the noise canceling on Plane flights... They come in Clutch when there is a Crying Brat on board"
2024-05-06,"For general use, they are amazing. But they are not low latency."
2024-05-06,"For me, the biggest difference from the Airpod Pro Gen1 and Gen 2 is transparency mode. Transparency mode in the gen 1's was good compared but the Gen 2's were the closest to normal hearing I've ever heard with any headphones I've owned. Better than the Sennheiser Momentums, Beoplay E2, Sony 1000xm5 and the gen1's. 

I also had problem with them falling out of my ears until I replaced the eartips with the Foam Master Memory Foam v4's.  These were a night and day difference for me and they don't fall out of my ears even after some activity. Kinda pricey though."
2024-05-06,"bought 2 pairs off the street for 50 bucks but

![gif](giphy|w0mylo7p4OXUQ)

and yeah they work great, audiophile here 2 üï∫üèª"
2024-05-06,"I'm new to the Apple ecosystem, well not new but haven't owned anything since the first ipod haha I'm a samsung user and have the airpod Pro 2s for my phone and laptop. 

The sound quality is really top notch, they sound great with good clarity. ANC is honestly amazing and the besr ive swen even compared to headphones, transparency is really nice too but i hardly, if ever, use it. 

The only con I've come across is the quality if the mic - its actually terrible, even more so at this price point. Ive been told the mic sounds distant, muted, or muffled and looking online on, on reddit and apple forums, this is a very common and known issue with no fix. 

My dad has an iphone that I used to check for updates and change settings, made a couple calls as well with the same issue, so the mic issue isnt because ""im not using an iphone"", even more so since apple forums are littered with the same issue lol 

I do say however, the pros outweigh the cons and im happy with my purchase. Well worth it."
2024-05-06,It depends with your needs. I think you‚Äôd be better off buying the previous gen as the changes are not that significant
2024-05-06,No get pros
2024-05-06,Yes! Adaptive Noise Cancellation is incredible.
2024-05-06,they are incredible! ü§©. the noise cancelling takes me away to my own world!
2024-05-06,"That picture is of regular AirPods, not AirPods Pro, isn't it?

I think the AirPods Pro 2 are quite good, fwiw."
2024-05-06,"Yes, everything that was wrong with the first gen, the second one optimised it and ANC is much better"
2024-05-06,Calling experience is really bad for the person who is trying to listen u. People always tell me I need new pair of headphones. Worst apple product. Noise canceling is really bad. The good: transparent mode and spatial sound mixed togueter bring a nice experience
2024-05-06,"The ANC is one of the best if not the best. I've tested the Sony's xm5s too and they're the only true competitors to the airpods pro gen 2. App2 are better because of the form factor and the seamless apple ecosystem.

PS: If you can, get an applecare plus for airpods. It will save a ton of money if they get damaged."
2024-05-06,I have both gen 1 and gen 2 pros. 2‚Äôs are way better in every way. Longer battery kind of similar noise cancelling effect.
2024-05-06,If u have more money left out in your bank account and u don't know how to spend it then airpods are 100% worth to buy
2024-05-06,I enjoyed getting the gen 2 pros. Better than the first gen but I handed those down for an upgrade excuse to get the new ones. I do like the newer features added to the case and the noise canceling is much better
2024-05-06,The ANC were so good as in you felt like drowning in a deep pool
2024-05-06,"I‚Äôve had AirPods1, Pro, and Pro gen 2. Pro gen 2 is superior to gen 1 on sound quality and adaptive audio. Also, and this may be minor to some, the ability to adjust the volume with a swipe on the earbud is a game changer for me."
2024-05-06,Well those are AirPods Gen 3 not AirPods Pro Gen 2
2024-05-06,The sound on these is great.  The problem for me is that they won't stay in my ears even with the largest tips.  I tried some of those foam tips on Amazon but those are no better.
2024-05-06,I feel like it‚Äôs the bass isn‚Äôt as strong as the first gen.
2024-05-06,I believe the tips are the same.
2024-05-06,"To me they were not, or at least not as much if I had bought them for full retail price. But they may be worth it for you, though. The ANC didn‚Äôt work well in my APP2‚Äôs."
2024-05-06,I did gen 3 because battery life was better but almost a year into them and the sound SUCKS!!!
2024-05-06,Yes..
2024-05-06,They have XS tips and you can also buy third party tips.
2024-05-08,https://amzn.to/3JRjmUf
2024-05-09,"If it‚Äôs only gonna be used on an Apple device, then yes, absolutely. My AirPods are without a doubt my favorite device. They are complete dog shit though when it comes to pairing it with anything else. I can never get a stable connection."
2024-05-09,"Yes!

I ended up buying mine randomly off some dude in Oakland who was selling a bunch of Apple Watches and AirPods out of his van‚Ä¶ You can‚Äôt beat $50 for brand new AirPod Pro 2 still in the plastic wrap! It made me wish I bought them legitimately SOONER!!! If I would have known how great they are I would have bought them for full price right when they came out."
2024-05-18,Every penny
2024-08-23,Air pods 2nd gen got good base ?
2024-10-13,Don‚Äôt pay 250 for them. You can get used or refurbished for half the price
2024-10-21,A definitive YES.  The Air Pod Pro 2's are incredible with the clarity of the no background noise when Noise Cancellation is enabled and the full range that they can produce. Absolutely a significant upgrade from the Air Pod Pro's. Better fit than the Air Pod Pro's. No distortion when the BASS is se to the max.  Overall are fantastic.
2025-03-22,I just want to see the feedback but idk how
2025-03-22,So new to this
2024-05-05,you might as well get a pair of Bose Quiet comfort buds for the noise cancellation and audio quality is about the same in my opinion
2024-05-05,"The tips are made from the same material. The only difference is that they now also include an xs size. You can purchase after market/third party ear tips made from different materials and are offered in even more sizes HOWEVER I doubt they would change your experience with them positively since what causes your problem (sweat and wax buildup) are from having ear tips in the first place.

I have recently ordered a few tips from Comply that are made of foam that apparently offer a better seal which improve sound quality and potentially comfort as they mould to your ear and a few more tips from a brand I can‚Äôt remember that are a combination of foam and silicone like the apple ones that would offer better longevity than the foam tips mentioned above. They can be a little pricey for what they are but I‚Äôm hoping they bring a lot of value as I use my airpods a lot. I‚Äôve got the 2nd gen non type C and honestly sq may be a little better than the og‚Äôs but when you‚Äôre out and about and being active I can‚Äôt really tell. I haven‚Äôt gotten to try any of the tips yet if you‚Äôre interested in what I think send me a message in about 4 weeks cause I‚Äôm overseas and haven‚Äôt tried them yet."
2024-05-05,"Nah.  Not loud enough , the mic is trash ."
2024-05-05,Search this sub for ‚Äúworth it‚Äù and you‚Äôll get literally dozens of posts answering this exact question
2024-05-06,Airpods are never worth it..  theres so much better stuff out there
2024-05-05,"No.
Overpriced battery powered nonsense with a half eaten apple printed on it is not worth it.

A pair of 30 euro Chifis sounds better that apples mess they call headphones."
2024-05-05,Naa
2024-05-05,"If you pay full price, then no. I bought them on eBay for $100. Pay more than that and you‚Äôll feel scammed."
2024-05-05,Nope.
2024-05-06,Are the Pro Gen 2 worth picking up with the Gen 3 coming out in a few months?
2024-05-05,Is it enough for airplanes?
2024-06-29,"Am I losing my mind? I just got these exclusively for the ANC that everyone is talking about and they cancel out about as much noise, with ANC on, as my 1s do without it on. Very disappointed and returning them."
2024-05-05,I did not like one but love 2
2024-05-06,Yes!! The tracking is quite a bit better!
2024-05-05,Suggest to your partner to look into getting tested for Sleep apnea.
2024-05-05,Isn‚Äôt a simple ear plug cheaper?
2024-05-05,You used them during the concert?
2024-08-26,"Thank you so much for saying this: I have been using earplugs and I don‚Äôt get any help from it, so this is a phenomenal tip!!!!!"
2024-05-06,The Pro 3s arnt due until 2025 I believe
2024-05-05,Just go to the Apple Store and they‚Äôll test and replace them. Apple‚Äôs very good like that.
2024-05-05,Mine have crackled since day 1!  Apple support not helpful yet.
2024-05-05,Deff don‚Äôt break easy
2024-05-06,"Are you sure yours are original? My pro 2 are excellent at sound quality, noise cancelling and also microphone is clear and crisp.
Note that fakes also have these features"
2024-05-05,The airpods sound better if you check online for the frequency response graph. If u can't tell the difference means there's smth wrong
2024-05-07,"Lol Pro Gen 3 isn't even coming out this year, let alone few months"
2024-05-05,"Did a fair bit of plane travelling in the month of March, flew 4 different times, two connecting flights and honestly the AirPods Pro 2 were a god send. Came off the plane not feeling as fatigued as normal, whether that was simply down to less noise, more peace and quiet, I‚Äôll let anyone else be the judge but personally it felt that way to me."
2024-05-06,"Yes, for short flights. Not really for long flights.

NYC <-> LA is absolutely perfect but anything longer you're gonna have to sit and wait until the APP2 are charged. You'll find the noise cancellation equal to the Sony XM4's (my only point of reference)."
2024-05-06,"There pretty good if your also playing music i personally use airpods max which are literally insanely good for plane travels.

If you travel alot id probably recommend that investment"
2024-05-06,I work in a fairly loud factory and I have had people screaming at me and couldn‚Äôt hear them (please don‚Äôt use around dangerous machines).
2024-05-05,Mine ran out of battery 3/4 way through the 3.5 hour flight
2024-05-06,Very much yes
2024-05-06,"The NC yes, but if you are prone to ear suck, the pressure feeling after long periods of use, airpods have been pretty bad for that in my experience, especially on planes."
2024-05-06,"I have both APP2 and Sony XM3, and tbh, you‚Äôre better off, like WAY better off with headphones"
2024-05-06,Most definitely yes sir very much so
2024-05-07,"My noise cancelling cancelled out the fire alarm in my school, which is criminally loud, so noise cancelling is great üëç"
2024-05-09,"Tbh, I can‚Äôt hear a damn thang with no sound playing and just the earbuds in! 

My girlfriend tries talking to me when I‚Äôm doing chores and pausing my music usually doesn‚Äôt work, I have to pull them out my ears to hear what she‚Äôs saying"
2024-07-04,"the 2's are waaay better than the 1's, at least that was my xp"
2024-05-05,How?
2024-05-06,idkw but i giggled at this
2024-05-05,"He definitely has it. He is a US Vet that acquired it while on active duty. He should have a CPAP machine but refuses to have one stating, ‚Äú I will not feel suffocated with something on my face while I sleep‚Äù. I totally get it! I guess that means I suffer‚Ä¶oh well! ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
2024-05-06,"I‚Äôm a fan of white/brown noise. So although cheaper, I need to hear something- just don‚Äôt the snoring üòÜ"
2024-05-05,Saved some possible ear damage I guess
2024-05-05,"they‚Äôre better than most concert earplugs, you can still hear everything with a really good sound dynamic, just without destryoing-your-hearing levels of noise"
2024-11-07,J√° estamos em Novembro! vc mentiu pra n√≥s! O purgat√≥rio te espera!
2024-05-05,"I have mine since december 2022 i bought a plastic protection case for ~10 dollars , they fell once in it and the case cracked inside.The battery life is trash after 1,5 years   and they sound  quieter.
Some how even xiaomi earbuds that I got in 2017 that even fell in water are louder and better battery life."
2024-05-09,Good to know! I‚Äôll pick some up then soon.
2024-05-06,Love the noise cancellation on my XM4s. My go to pair for air travel.
2024-05-06,charging is pretty quick though - using them always on flights up to 13h - they only need to go in the box for charging once i think
2024-05-06,"Is there some trick to the noise cancelling? I have xm4‚Äôs and the APP2 are not comparable in noise cancelling. I can still hear different noises, simple things like moving my have along a desk it sounds like the noise cancel is ‚Äúletting‚Äù that noise through electronically. And yes I have noise cancelling fully turned on but it still happens. When I put the xm4‚Äôs on I‚Äôm completely isolated."
2024-05-06,did you have them charged previously? mine last atleast 5 hours
2024-05-06,I had REALLY bad thumping with the 1s and I don‚Äôt think the audio quality was as good. The thumping while walking was the dealbreaker tho. It was overbearing.
2024-05-05,"Dang, well I can understand that.¬†

I use nasal cpap mask that cover my nose and doesn‚Äôt fee suffacoted but my friend and dad said that they don‚Äôt want to use it for the same reason üòÇ"
2024-05-05,"Tell him sleep apnea causes dementia. And the quality of sleep with a machine is sooo much better. You can get masks that only cover the nose, which helps mitigate the clunkiness."
2024-05-05,"The nasal pillows don‚Äôt suffocate at all, it‚Äôs pretty comfortable tbh‚Ä¶ just get him to get a proper cpap trial, it‚Äôll be worth it"
2024-05-06,"Lol this is exactly the opposite of what the CPAP machine does üòÇ without it = person doesn‚Äôt breathe, with it = person can breathe. 

Well, if it helps anyhow: my wife uses a CPAP mask that is very small, only covers her nose. Maybe showing this helps convincing him to try. 

Also, her sleep improved 1000% after starting using it. Before the CPAP she had constant headaches and always felt tired because she was barely sleeping since the apnea woke her up during the night multiple times (without her noticing)."
2024-05-05,Divorce?
2024-05-06,"Was he diagnosed with minor, moderate, or severe sleep apnea? If it‚Äôs minor, he could use a prescribed sleep apnea mouth guard."
2024-09-12,Sleeep apena is real bad i thought the same until i woke up feeling super refreshed.
2024-05-06,"This is 1000% a good use of their ANC!

I was a huge advocate for standard noise filtering earplugs but with the APP2‚Äôs, it‚Äôs a no brainer"
2024-05-05,I dropped mine without a case about a hundred times and they work perfectly fine.
2024-05-06,Nah
2024-05-06,If the microphone and transparency mode was just as good as APP2 it would be my choice for travel!
2024-05-06,"I‚Äôm not sure, have you accidentally turned on Adaptive instead of Noise Cancellation. 

Have you done the ear tip fit test?

I also use my APP2 in the office when taking meetings when it‚Äôs too loud and cancels everyone around me talking."
2024-05-06,It's probably just me using it before flight
2024-05-06,"Mine which are only 1 day old only lasts 100% to 20% in 2 hours. Mixed use but mostly just ANC on and nothing playing.
Other than all that crazy amount of white noise in the background"
2024-05-06,"I also have this and somehow nobody else does. I've owned the sony WF 1000XM3s and could only use them while sitting still, anything else would overpower what I'm listening to and be extremely uncomfortable while reviews always talk about running with earpods. The app2 are significantly better but I still can't run with them."
2024-11-07,eles preferem ter infarto. n√£o se sentir decansados... faz parte.
2024-05-06,AirPods are cheaperü§£
2024-05-06,"I would be scared to lose them, somehow none of the tips fit perfectly for me and I have to adjust every few minutes to make sure they still sit stable in the ear"
2024-05-06,Yea dude must be smashing his lmfao
2024-05-06,They are?
2024-05-07,They make sports clips for them that loop around your ear so they don‚Äôt pop out as well as they also have neckbands that prevent them from getting lost easily. Definitely worth it for special occasions or if you‚Äôre working in risky areas where you could drop and lose them!
2024-10-10,I have them after owning both the Pro 1s and the original AirPods. I love them. Their ANC is better than the Pro 1s and the Adaptive mode is the bomb. It learns how to adapt to your surroundings. Battery power is good and they weirdly stay in very well.
2024-10-10,"yes, cheapest price u will ever get"
2024-10-10,"My Pro1 won‚Äôt last more than 2 hours with NC enabled. I‚Äôve had em for around 3-4 years. I just upgraded to the Pro2, couldn‚Äôt pass up on the price. The NC on the Pro2 is much better than Pro1. Best Buy won‚Äôt price match due to the price is only for prime members."
2024-10-10,I have only heard great things about the PRO2. Waiting for my PRO1 to die before I upgrade. Maybe you can price match in store at a Target or BestBuy today so you dont have to join prime.
2024-10-10,"The AirPods Pro 2 are great, I see myself sticking with them for as long as they work and the battery stays good. The last couple years of software updates have made them more fully featured than ever"
2024-10-10,"Best A/V purchase of my life, bar none. You won‚Äôt be disappointed."
2024-10-10,Hard yes. Just upgraded from the originals and the 2's are so much better
2024-10-10,Unless somehow app3 launch next year app2 still hold up
2024-10-10,"My AirPods Pro 2 are great at everything except staying in my ear, which they are only pretty good at. This is obviously an issue with individual fit and hard to know until you use them.
I had AirPods 2 before this and they never fell out."
2024-10-10,"I bought them for $249.99 at launch and felt like that was a steal for all the value I got out of them. They‚Äôre basically the best all-round earbuds today, so definitely worth it for $169.99 - especially with all the new hearing protection/test/aid features"
2024-10-10,Do it!
2024-10-10,I hope so. I just ordered them a couple hours ago. I just want noise cancelation. My AirPods 3s don‚Äôt have ANC
2024-10-10,They are the latest AirPods so I‚Äôm yeah they are it‚Äôs a no brainer
2024-10-10,"Well I can‚Äôt express  my reviews on the performance of the pods as of yet because I don‚Äôt have them. However, I did order them through Amazon prime during their sale and I want a prime member until today. I was able to subscribe for only 1.99 to participate in the sale! I say go for it because the listing cost is 294! Let‚Äôs not forget tax üò£i‚Äôm glad I got them for $180 rather then 294. *That* I can do."
2024-10-10,"I just got them. BB/Target won‚Äôt price match. 

Had the 1st Gen for 4 years, got them replaced through warranty twice I think, now they rattle and ANC isn‚Äôt great but hold a charge long enough for my 1.5 hour workout. 

Everyone talks about how the 2nd Gen is so much better, I‚Äôm ready to find out"
2024-10-10,absolutely worth
2024-10-10,Costco is an option
2024-10-10,big yes
2024-10-10,They're absolutely incredible. Buy them and be amazed.
2024-10-10,Might be same or cheaper price on Black Friday
2024-10-10,"Yes, it's a steal, get them!"
2024-10-10,Yes even at 200 even at 250 they are worth it
2024-10-10,Yes 1000%
2024-10-10,Yes.
2024-10-10,"AirPods pro2 best ance on the market and the adaptive mode is great. For sure it will be day and night with your AirPods 2, comfort will also take a hit. Personally, the AirPods Pro are very comfortable, the only ones that dethrone them are the Jabra elite 10 gen 2"
2024-10-10,"Yes, AirPods have been the best purchase I have made in regards to cost vs usage. Absolutely recommend the pro 2"
2024-10-10,"For those who missed prime day Target currently has the same sale( May not be EXACTLY the same but definitely comparable). If not able to get the Pro 2 I suggest getting the Airpod 4 w/ ANC. Being transparent, it‚Äôs literally almost the same to me. The AirPod 4s don‚Äôt have a silicone tip, so you will be missing out on some of the extra noise cancellation the Pro 2s give but I personally enjoy the AirPod 4s. 

Is there anyone else who has tried both? If so which ones do you feel are better?"
2024-10-10,"Yes, they are brilliant. Their ANC is amazing and the sound is way better than early gen. They are great"
2024-10-10,Yeeepp
2024-10-10,"Yeas, I bought them on the 9th and they got here today!"
2024-10-11,honestly you're saving 5 dollars by getting prime after paying the 15$ subscription.  if it's not a subscription you're going to use i would just buy them outright
2024-10-11,"I got these just to be finally rid of lightening in my life‚Ä¶. except the kind from the sky.   Love my existing APP2 which will become my exercise pair, and the usb-c my daily carry pair."
2024-10-13,AirPods Pro 2 are very good. A tiny contact in my charging case got bent or something and Apple wants $89 for a new one. A $40 clone is on order.
2024-10-14,Did anyone get the ones through Amazon for $168?   I received mine yesterday and they shipped the AirPod Pro 2nd generation and not the AirPod pro 2.  Anyone else have that problem?
2024-10-28,Why doesn't Apple make these things in different colors? I'd rather have them close to my skin tone so it's not as obvious as having these bright white things sticking out of your ears.
2024-12-03,"Bought Pro2‚Äôs from Target at $169 since my Pro1‚Äôs just shit the bed, so far I am loving them!"
2024-12-06,The Pro 2 I had purchased in March of 2023 doesn't have the Hearing Aid functionality. The one I got yesterday for 169.99 does and it's amazing. So I just ordered another one
2024-12-07,I just got a pair of AirPods Pro 2 and and they are a significant improvement over my Pro 1. Well worth the $169
2024-12-14,"I‚Äôd say go for it! I upgraded to the¬†AirPods Pro 2¬†a few months ago, and they‚Äôre such a huge improvement over the regular AirPods. The noise cancellation is amazing, and the silicone tips make them way more comfortable for long use. At $168.99, it‚Äôs a solid deal‚Äîplus, joining Prime for $15 still leaves you saving compared to the regular price. Sounds like it‚Äôd solve the issues you‚Äôve had with your current earbuds too!"
2024-12-23,"On sale again, Amazon. $189.ü´†"
2025-02-10,"If you are in the states its ok, but false advertising for Canadians, there is no hearing aid feature in Canada if thats what you are excited about."
2025-03-26,Totally worth it if you use Apple ecosystem. They seamlessly integrate with everything from your phone to the Apple TV . That last one is especially helpful if you‚Äôre a night owl who stays up watching tv while your partner tries to sleep. They instantly turn into tv headphones.
2024-10-10,"They‚Äôre pretty great, but don‚Äôt be too fooled by the deal. It‚Äôs good, but if you have a Costco membership, they‚Äôve had them on sale for $199 for awhile.  That $199 includes AppleCare+, which is approx $30.   So the Amazon sale price + AppleCare+ afterwards is pretty much the same price."
2024-10-10,"Yep, it‚Äôs worth. They aren‚Äôt as good as my $800 open backs sound quality wise, but they are pretty good for the $200 price tier. I could also notice the upgrade from APP 1."
2024-11-26,They‚Äôre $153.99 now
2024-11-30,Walmart
2024-10-10,"They will likely only price match the non-prime price at $190, not the $169"
2024-10-10,"I have pro 2 and the new AirPod 4s with ANC. I work from home and use AirPods a lot every day. 

I use the 4s mostly because they‚Äôre way more comfy and the sound quality to me is comparable if not better in some instances. I still use the pro 2s when the very loud gardeners are next door which the ANC on the 4 is t strong enough to eliminate or the 4 battery, which is noticeably shorter, dies."
2024-10-10,Me too!
2024-10-21,"if this never resolves, I use beat fit pro‚Äôs for working out , and I thought I lost them, so I bought Airpod pro 2‚Äôs, They‚Äôve never fallen out, and tbh, I genuinely can‚Äôt tell a difference in sound quality between them and my Airpod pro 2‚Äôs so I‚Äôm returning them."
2024-12-04,I have the same problem my old AirPods are the only ones that stay in my ears. They are not noise cancelling which is annoying.
2024-10-21,I got them but I‚Äôm returning mine because I don‚Äôt find the sound quality much better than my best fit pro‚Äôs
2024-11-16,How is it?
2024-10-10,Really? I just ordered from Target. It‚Äôs $190
2025-02-18,These are the same thing
2024-10-10,You really don‚Äôt need Apple care for headphones. I have had AirPods since they first launch and never needed it.
2024-10-10,So you‚Äôre comparing $200 headphones to $800.
2024-11-26,Hi! From where?!?
2024-11-29,Target has circle coupons for 15 off 90 or 25 off 150 that drop it even more. Just got some for $123 plus tax.
2024-10-10,"You were downvoted but I literally just got off chat with Best Buy support. I bought my AirPod pro 2 last week and they refused to price match to $169, just $190.

So I‚Äôm just going to return them to Best Buy and buy on Amazon."
2024-11-09,"Tbh it‚Äôs common for most places to not match online prices, only other brick and mortar retailers"
2024-10-11,The comfy factor is definitely one reason to take the 4s over the Pro 2s. I like the Pro 2s for the features but I used to have 3s and generally found them more comfortable and less fatiguing on the ear
2024-10-10,"Same, I copped the pro 2‚Äôs since I‚Äôve been eyeing them for quite a while but my AirPods gen 2 (which I use everyday, on travel, vacay etc for YEARS) work perfectly fine and I didn‚Äôt have Apple care."
2024-10-10,He wants people to know that he has a $800 pair of headphones
2024-10-10,"I mean, in an apples to oranges way. Just saying they‚Äôre good, but in the grand scheme of headphones and IEMs they‚Äôre just good for the $200 tier that they‚Äôre in. Didn‚Äôt mean to trigger you."
2024-11-26,Target and Amazon
2024-11-29,How do you get circle coupons!
2024-11-30,I don‚Äôt see this coupon. Did they get rid of it or something?
2024-11-15,"office airport continue spoon somber impossible tidy sugar file light

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*"
2024-10-10,Not next to nothing tho is it?  Apple care initial cost and then is there a fee for using the insurance / warranty ?  Or is that free?
2024-10-10,"""Hey guys is Lexus es350 a good car?""

""Well it's good for the price but compared to my $1,00,000 LFA with a V10 it's not so great. Didn't mean to trigger you heh"""
2024-10-11,"Nobody is triggered, it‚Äôs just weird that you would compare $800 headphones to $200 and say they aren‚Äôt as good, why not compare to them say other $200 headphones or even similar style (in-ear) buds."
2024-11-29,I‚Äôm about to get mine for $117 with the target circle discount.
2024-10-10,I think he‚Äôs just calling us broke in a non aggressive way ü§£
2024-10-12,"It‚Äôs not weird to compare sound quality. It would be weird to compare use cases. The sentiment I was trying to get across is that they are a good buy at $169, $200 even but in terms of sound quality for music, they aren‚Äôt world beaters‚Äîthey don‚Äôt punch that far out of their weight class. Keep expectations in check and you‚Äôll be happy with them. 

Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have mentioned price/openbacks, but was trying to add a source to the sound quality assertion instead of just saying trust me bro. I could have compared sound quality to my similarly priced wired IEMs instead.

Overall verdict remains the same, APP2 are good‚Äîespecially at $169."
2024-11-29,I‚Äôm not seeing this coupon on mine. I‚Äôm only seeing 15% off. Where are you seeing yours?
2024-10-10,Which would typically be 2-3 years for $60 - $90 dollars extra. You could simply sell your existing AirPods every 2 years and save money have a new device.
2024-11-14,pretty sure it doesn't cover lost airpods
2024-10-10,"Worth noting If you break them it's an extra $29, still worth it though of course"
2024-10-02,"the adaptive is so nice especially when I am walking my dogs, because I can enjoy the benefits of ANC but if I run into a neighbor or someone calls me or there is voices, I am still aware what is going on."
2024-10-02,"Upgraded to APP2 from APP1, I forgot to note LOL"
2024-10-02,"Had the same experience but the anc noise cancelling dropped off after a few days and switching the tips didn‚Äôt improve anything. 

I was on a plane (70 db according to my Apple Watch) and only thing I was hearing was only a very silent humming (no music playing).

Now it just feels like passive noise cancelling."
2024-10-03,"Have any of you compared the ANC On Pods Pro 2 with the ANC on AirPods 4 with ANC?  I‚Äôve never listened to the Pro, but I got to say the ANC on just the 4 is the best ANC I‚Äôve ever heard.  Wayyy better than any of my Beats.

I would‚Äôve gotten the Pro2, but the silicone ear inserts massively irritate my ear canal so I can‚Äôt wear anything like them üò©"
2024-10-04,The only issue I have with the adaptive mode is that I can‚Äôt sing along to my music! But then everyone else might be thanking the adaptive mode of my AirPods!
2024-10-02,"True! I purchased airpod pros second gen last week and the noise cancellation is excellent! Makes train rides to work more comfortable as it blocks out majority of the sound. 

The only problem I had was that I thought my iPhone charger, (purchased a 13 pro max two years ago) would work with my airpods. The only charger that works with my airpods are the USB C android charger that I had lying around my house."
2024-10-02,"What version of firmware do you have?
I think you will say other things about ANC after getting 7A305‚Ä¶."
2024-10-02,How is the microphone for you? My Gen 1 are awful
2024-10-03,"The adaptive mode is a game changer for me, work in a loud ups warehouse.  We‚Äôre them all the time at work.  Helps protect my hearing."
2024-10-03,same
2024-10-03,Do the newest AirPod Pro‚Äôs have the adaptive option?
2024-10-03,Airpods pro 2 is so good that even when i switched to S24Ultra the sound is still awesome!
2024-10-03,AirPods Pro 2 ANC is insanely good
2024-10-03,Nice. I‚Äôm still considering between Pro 2 and v4
2024-10-04,I pulled out my original AirPods Pro the other day after upgrading a year or so ago and the difference in sound quality was so stark I was sure they were broken.
2024-10-04,Is there a sound quality difference between 1 & 2 that you notice?
2024-10-06,"I got a pair too, love them. However, the noise cancelling gives me pretty bad headaches. I‚Äôve been switching back and forth between the pro 2 and pro 1, and the pro 1 doesn‚Äôt give me headaches at all. Makes me wonder if the tech is vastly different"
2024-10-31,"Can someone tell me if the phone calls are great on this device. I do many business call and I need something that works. 

I have the galaxy  buds pro 2. I considered getting the One Plus Buds Pro3, but I can seem to find proper reviews. I am using a Note 10+, and I understand that I will some functionality. I have a mac computer so I will be able to map out my touch settings. 

I would appreciate the feedback."
2024-10-02,"I daily the AirPods Pro first gen before gen 2 came out. When it released, bought it immediately telling myself I‚Äôm just buying to test it and will probally return it, how much of an improvement will it be right ? 

LOL tried it and I have been using my gen 2 ever since."
2024-10-02,Imagine my reaction when i switch from broken earpods to airpods pro 2 üòÇ
2024-10-02,![gif](giphy|3zuI7K90jI9by)
2024-10-02,Yeah and in iOS 18 you can adjust the sensitivity of the adaptive mode.
2024-10-02,"I was once walking with my AirPods on there was a blaring ambulance which passed by, the ANC silenced the high pitch sirens by itself. I really dig that."
2024-10-02,"Only thing I don‚Äôt like is the fit in my ears. They‚Äôll fall out if I talk too long. Like I don‚Äôt know why but it feels like when I talk, the movement of my TMJ seems to gradually push it out of my ear. Never had that with any other earbuds before. It‚Äôs fine if I‚Äôm completely stationary or not talking. I‚Äôve tried some foam tip ear tips but it doesn‚Äôt make much of a difference"
2024-10-02,"I want this for myself, as soon as I could afford it"
2024-10-02,Upgraded from what?
2024-10-02,"Coming from the Airpods Pro 2nd gen I can't say that I really notice much difference.  I feel like getting a new set of tips probably makes them fit a bit snugger, but for me at least the noise cancellation didn't seem dramatically better than the 2nd gen.  I am middle aged so maybe it's blocking more high end that I am less sensitive to now? :("
2024-10-02,Best EarPods on the planet
2024-10-02,Where did you purchase them
2024-10-03,The conversation awareness feature is great. I normally have it on when warming up at basketball practice. Very pleased with this upgrade after my launch Pros ANC/Transparency became unusable
2024-10-03,30% where?
2024-10-03,ur so oa po
2024-10-03,Good luck when it starts automatically turning on Apple Music everytime you place an earbud. Or when it plays through the earbuds while in the case. üò°
2024-10-03,"If you are from PH, which store offers discount + installment?"
2024-10-03,First time I used noise cancellation I was surprised myself works really good
2024-10-03,I just got these! First AirPods ever and they sound great and I love the adaptive ANC - that's when I start talking they automagically turn off right? It's great for dog walk + podcast listen
2024-10-03,totally with you on the seamless transitions. my last pair of wireless (non-apple) had such a jarring transition sound. almost as if they wanted to annoy me lol
2024-10-03,now i want to upgrade my app1‚Ä¶ but i hated the apple silicone tip so much i replaced it with the azla tips... is the app2 tips much better?
2024-10-03,I felt the same exact way. Shits clutch
2024-10-03,have fun when the pops and crackles start ü•∞
2024-10-03,"I‚Äôve never used noise canceling headphones before. So when I bought the Pro 2 at the mall and put them right on, I everything went quiet. Only my thoughts were left. It felt so weird at first! I appreciate the feature so much now, I mostly use Adaptive mode."
2024-10-03,Can the conversation awareness be switched off ?
2024-10-03,"I little advice. There will be a time the case itself wont charge wirelessly. Just reset the airpod (you can youtube it) if it doesn‚Äôt work like mine. Mine worked once, I reset it and it worked but now it doesn‚Äôt work. But when I charge it via lightning it charges. My wireless charging is fuc*ed up. Nonetheless the airpods pro 2 is superb."
2024-10-03,"when it comes to sound quality, bass is still not super good. Comparing to my 4 years old jabra elites, jabra bass is superior,while airpods gives more detail but where airpods really shine is anc and transparency and call quality. In office i use airpods coz of that."
2024-10-03,How anyone finds these things comfortable is beyond me
2024-10-03,It‚Äôs a shame they don‚Äôt sit in my ear right  and just fall out
2024-10-04,What 30%
2024-10-04,I‚Äôm still rocking the APP1 haha been thinking of upgrading just to have usb-c charging for it.
2024-10-04,It may be a good idea to rename your AirPods your phone number. If you ever lose them and someone holds them up to their phone I think it says the name of them.
2024-10-05,hihi
2024-10-05,"They‚Äôre 2 years old.. why wouldn‚Äôt you go for the recent AirPods release? I did. My partner has the AirPod Pro 2 and these new AirPod 4s are way better and she says so too, especially the comfort too"
2024-10-05,I have had these for about a week now. I can‚Äôt find them on find my iPhone to register them. Anyone got any tips?
2024-11-19,"(6 month owner) The Pro-2 was better than the first Pro-gens. It has way better sound; I can hear music when I talk with people while using them, though it takes getting used to. I can't sing along (which is nice for others who are subjected to me singing), and it has better noise canceling. I had some problems with the side buttons doing what I assigned them to do, but I never used them anyway.

Edit: They only occasionally fall out of my ear when all other types would slip out (even changing ear foam size when I was just walking). I don't know why they are better."
2025-01-22,"Aipod Pro 2 ANC insane,
But cant find a suitable silicon bush for me. 

Everyday changing.. 

‚ÄúEar tip fit test‚Äù suggests a bigger one, which is not comfortable for me ."
2025-02-16,Any one know when Apple will turn on the hearing assistance for the UK?
2024-10-02,It‚Äôs nice till your wife washes them in the washer.
2024-10-02,Who the fuk finances AirPods ? Lmao. ‚ÄòMerica.
2024-10-02,Hello James.
2024-10-02,You upgrades from pro1 to pro2 ?
2024-10-02,wait 30% discount where?
2024-10-02,What discount is that lol
2024-10-02,Are they better than the new 4s?
2024-10-03,I came from jabra 65t which are old as hell. And I was supper dissapointed in lack of good bass. I mean the difference is so damn huge. Airpods just sound so flat...
2024-10-02,"I have to turn the conversational awareness off for a few reasons. One I live alone and don‚Äôt have to worry about needing it. But most of all, I talk to myself so  damn much. Or just say stuff out loud, that whatever I‚Äôm listening to would be constantly interrupted. 

I only had my Pro 2s for a week before the announcement about the new AirPods 4. So I returned them and waited for them to be released. The Pro‚Äôs silicone ear prices stayed in my ears better than other brands with silicone. But not enough. Had one fall out one too many times. The icing on the cake was it fell out literally right after deep cleaning the toilet."
2024-10-02,What are installment rates? Do you have to pay to get them installed on your phone?
2024-10-02,I use adaptive too when I am walking. Noise cancellation really blocks noise that you cannot hear vehicle sounds or people near you. Safety reasons.
2024-10-02,Im so so on the feature. I tried it out and I guess I make a lot of noises subconsciously that the AirPods detect as me talking and kill the music. Maybe if I could tweak the sensitivity it would be good.
2024-10-02,Is adaptive diffrent to conversation awareness? I can never find the answer
2024-10-03,"adaptive doesnt do shit for me, why could it be?"
2024-10-03,Definitely worth the price. They even sound good for music mixing. Pretty crazy.
2024-10-02,I have the exact same experience. Always wondered if it really decreased or if i just more and more getting used to
2024-10-02,"I will say cleaning my AirPods helped bring back the noise cancellation. A night and day difference honestly 

https://support.apple.com/en-us/120409"
2024-10-02,Take it to apple if under warranty and they will replace it for free
2024-10-03,Are you in a high elevated place?
2024-10-02,"Same happened to my gen 1 pros. Was riding down mountains with em on. My theory is that it's mic failure that makes the anc hard to implement. 

Dirt for me but probably just bad mics for some people. Other earbuds have super high mic failure rates. Nevermind pairing issues. 

I will always get insurance on earbuds now."
2024-10-02,Yea the noise cancelling is horrible for me no matter the ear tips. I‚Äôm at the gym and literally nothing changes when I activate the noise canceling
2024-10-04,Get ‚ÄúComply‚Äù brand foam eartips from Amazon. I can never go back now. Huge improvement.
2024-10-03,"I was able to try the AirPods 4 w ANC yesterday at the Apple Store. Bought it and stayed at the Apple Store for a while to test it. Eventually I decided to ask and try the AirPods Pro 2 and immediately noticed the difference. I have been using my AirPods 3 since it came out, while there‚Äôs an improvement in the sound quality with the ANC 4, I would say get the Pro 2 if you could shell out the extra money and if it fits your ears comfortably. I own a pair of AirPods Max as well but mostly on the go, and especially in London always rainy, Id rather carry the more compact AirPods Pro 2."
2024-10-03,Really the 4's are the best anc you've ever heard?? They are very mediocre and nowhere near other anc earphones/headphones due to the open design
2024-10-03,I‚Äôm finding that the noise cancelling isn‚Äôt as good after a few years. The ANC allows background hum and voices through now. It‚Äôs still low enough it can be easily drowned out by music but it‚Äôs not like I go deaf while it‚Äôs on anymore.
2024-10-03,"Wait, your airpods doesn‚Äôt include a USB-C cable? Because mine has one."
2024-10-02,I also experience a worse ANC with the latest Firmware. Anybody else also? @OP: What is your AirPods Pro 2 firmware version?
2024-10-02,"Not true for all , it's a bit inconsistent. For example mine got better"
2024-10-03,I already have the 7A305. Yeah it‚Äôs amaaaaazing
2024-10-04,"same conversation happened for AirPods Pro 1 and more controversially, the AirPods Max"
2024-10-03,I haven‚Äôt really used the mic except for that one time I recorded a video while wearing the pods. Audio quality on the video is good though.
2025-01-03,No way. I‚Äôm questioning if I should buy it but your comment pushed me over. Screw it. Personal birthday gift to me haha
2024-10-03,Ohhh that must have felt so amazing haha
2024-10-03,Peanut butter and jaaaaaaaaaaammmmmm
2024-10-03,sorry to hear that. the built in tips don‚Äôt do it for me too so i switched to a larger one and it‚Äôs good
2024-10-02,Right?
2024-10-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/airpods/s/yuQGanF0rW HAHAHAHA i forgot to note it on the title
2024-10-02,Huh? 2nd gen is what the OP is talking about and 2nd gen is also the latest Pro generation.
2024-10-03,"From the Apple store in Shopee, a famous local online shopping app in Southeast Asia."

2024-10-02,$250 a pop.. yea I mean lots of people.. why spend all that money now when you could save it and use it for other things and pay it off over time.
2024-10-02,"Millions of people worldwide finance all sorts of of things, Klarna itself finances tons of things under ¬£100 for people it‚Äôs nothing new or outrageous."
2024-10-03,"Shopee, a famous Southeast Asian online mall"
2024-10-02,was wondering the same but haven‚Äôt been able to find anything on google that made sense..
2024-10-03,"Idk. Maybe the random discounts of the app because of payday sales (I purchased this on Shopee, a famous online mall in SEA)"
2024-10-02,I had to turn it off because I talk to my dog so much ü§£
2024-10-02,Same. When humming to music i sometimes mumble the lyrics to myself and that registers as conversation so it activates lol
2024-10-03,Installments like equal monthly payments when you buy a product using credit‚Ä¶
2024-10-02,"Yes, with dogs I am kinda okay, since they are aware but you never know, so the feature is nice and I never notice it‚Äôs active till I need it, so really it‚Äôs no reason not to have it on."
2024-10-02,"Hmm, maybe. Idk I‚Äôve mouthed song lyrics and be fighting for my life going up hills sometimes and it doesn‚Äôt trigger"
2024-10-03,It sometimes activates when I sneeze lol
2024-10-06,Same. I sometimes hum (and I apparently hum much more than I realize) and it triggers so I‚Äôve disabled it
2024-10-02,"Absolutely different. 

Conversation awareness works across all settings (ANC, Adaptive and Transparency) and ducks audio volume/toggles on Transparency automatically when it hears you start speaking. 

It also boosts the volume of people in front of you to help you hear them better (which I haven‚Äôt reaaaally noticed)."
2024-10-02,"Adaptive seems to switch between transparency and ANC on a sliding scale, it lowers the volume of the music a little depending on how long the conversation is. Example:

if I tell my dog to sit, the music lowers but does not fully cut off, if I start speaking to someone more than 2-3 words the music lowers to an almost whisper while voices are much easier to hear."
2024-10-03,"It has to ""adapt"" use it for a few days etc."
2024-10-03,May I ask you how you deal with latenty in mixing situation?
2024-10-03,"It is most certainly a mic issue, I have the same issue and noticed it flares up when my finger is over the mic or wind blows past it. Mine‚Äôs gotten to the point where vibrations from the music also cause it to flare up."
2024-10-03,Then it‚Äôs not working.
2024-10-04,"The reason I went with the AirPods 4 with ANC over the others is because the silicone inserts of the PodsPro2, or the moisture caused by the over ear headphones of the Pods Max, cause me extreme irritation in my ear canal.  It actually created an allergy for me.  

Apple uses low grade silicone which can lead to this allergy.  If you Google it, you‚Äôll see it‚Äôs a growing issue many are dealing with.  Just waiting for the class action lawsuit.  

And it came outta nowhere.  Never had an issue until suddenly I did and now it won‚Äôt go away.  So the AirPods 4 are the only headphones that don‚Äôt exacerbate the issue."
2024-10-04,"Yes really.  I‚Äôm not sure how much better it gets than completely silent surroundings.  

The Beats were atrocious and did a snap crackle and hiss.  My ears can‚Äôt handle the over ear headphones of the max or the silicone inserts of the pro or Beats Pro.  So this is the only earbud that won‚Äôt irritate my inner ear skin.  So for it to be able to do what it does without a true seal is actually amazing."
2024-10-02,Everybody based on some Apple Forums and Reddit posts‚Ä¶ hope that they will resolve this!
2024-10-02,"Hmmm very interesting.
Mine is like transparency‚Ä¶."
2024-10-03,"Also, the mic‚Äôs my one main issue with Gen 1. My friends can barely hear me when I‚Äôm on call so I remove the earphones when I am calling"
2024-10-03,What the fuck are you doing Phil!?
2024-10-03,"I tried upsizing with some of the ear tips that came with the AirPods, but it didn‚Äôt seem to help. I‚Äôve just resigned myself to using them only when I‚Äôm at my desk or at home and using a different pair for when I‚Äôm working out or potentially going out and walking around."
2024-10-03,Ah yes okay
2024-10-03,"Apple's naming is confusing but no, there was an Airpods Pro ""2nd generation"" with the H2 chip in 2022 and a USB-C update to that in 2023.  The newly released ones are named ""Airpods Pro 2"".  His screenshot clearly shows ""2nd generation"" in the name, so I assume that's what he had.

EDIT: I was mislead by the advertising :).  By all accounts the hardware is the same in the two.  I stand corrected."
2024-10-03,"‚ÄúThe program covers affected AirPods Pro for 3 years after the first retail sale of the unit.‚Äù

2024-10-02,R u in the UK
2024-10-03,What country lol
2024-10-03,I‚Äôd do the same if I currently had a dog or cat
2024-10-02,Lmao same!
2024-10-03,"Ah, okay! Why would you do that?"
2024-10-02,"Recently purchased these myself. Blown away by how good they are. Though I've lost the option to turn it fully off, anyone else?"
2024-10-02,I had to kill conversational awareness ‚Äòcos I sing to my dog when we‚Äôre walking. Great feature otherwise!
2024-10-02,"Conversation awareness pairs really nicely with adaptive mode, I use it on with that all the time."
2024-10-03,"That's conversation awareness, not adaptive."
2024-10-03,"Thankfully. I haven‚Äôt experienced that yet. But It might be feedback sensory from the noise cancelation modes. If you‚Äôre using Mac go to Bluetooth and hit i.  Two boxes have to be checked click one off and one noise cancellation. Then you can pinch the stem to switch between two. Then use adaptive for iPhone. Cause if checked it will go in and out sometimes. 

Hope that helps. Had 3 tabs open in a DAW full sounds zero issues. I‚Äôll test it with more midi setup and report back if i have any issues."
2024-10-04,"They use a somewhat proprietary protocol to communicate to iPhones and Macs, so if you use a Mac, in theory there should be less latency than standard Bluetooth earbuds."
2024-10-02,"mine got alot better aswell, couldn‚Äôt be farther from transparency, sorry you are experiencing that!"
2024-10-03,"Have you tried the extra small ones? I had to go down to these to keep them in my ears. I don‚Äôt think they are included and must be bought separately, but i could be misremembering."
2024-10-03,"There are ‚ÄúAirPods Pro 2nd Generation‚Äù with USB-C as well. I have some that were manufactured this  year. The change to ‚ÄúAirPods Pro 2‚Äù is purely a name change (and a very recent one); other than that, they‚Äôre identical.

AirPods Pro 2nd Generation and AirPods Pro 2 are exactly the same thing."
2024-10-03,Oh. I have the USB C one.
2024-10-02,"You sound like a boomer.. if we have the option and somebody wants to then let them do it.. why do you gotta control everyone‚Äôs fun?

FYI this is the opposite of financially crippling yourself. That would be buying it when you really don‚Äôt have the means and money to do so.. if we have a job we can buy it and pay for it over time rather than having to wait.. we grew up in a generation of we‚Äôd like to enjoy things now and not later."
2024-10-03,PH
2024-10-04,Credit building.
2024-10-02,I had that issue one go into settings-> accessibility options -> air pods (at the bottom under devices) and change volume control bar at the bottom from 100% down to whatever. After doing that the option was available for me again. You can revert the volume change after. No issue since.
2024-10-02,"No I can still switch between all my modes, have you tried a factory reset, sounds like a bug"
2024-10-02,Yeah it‚Äôs great when you‚Äôre out and about but i turn it off as soon as i‚Äôm home.
2024-10-03,CuteüòÇüëç
2024-10-03,Use adaptive with conversation awareness on
2024-10-03,Thank you.. will try them soon. Let me know if you notice things by testing further.
2024-10-03,"Mine came with the full range from XS to L. I think default was M which I think I‚Äôve used with other brands (not to say they‚Äôre the same, but I‚Äôve always just used the default). I‚Äôve gone down to the S and they‚Äôre ok, but I still have to be really careful when I‚Äôm walking around or talking as I feel one of them still feels like it‚Äôs slipping out."
2024-10-03,"Ok good luck with that. It‚Äôs actually sound advice to not finance things you want because you have no self control.

It‚Äôs $250, it‚Äôs not a lot of money. If you can‚Äôt afford $250 you can‚Äôt afford to buy it.

Next thing you know you‚Äôve got your financed AirPods, financed car, financed tv and financed phone payments taking half your paycheck and now you‚Äôre in shit because you have no ability to budget. 

Being fiscally responsible is not boomer logic."
2024-10-02,"As someone who is most certainly not a boomer, I think you should reevaluate your view on personal finance.  Part of the reason our current generations are so poorly off financially (in addition to a crap economy) is a lack of discipline in saving their money.  $250 in the scheme of things is a small purchase and financing that for AirPods is much different than using financing for more important things like automotive repairs to get yourself to work."
2024-10-04,That's insane
2024-10-02,"Thanks, did try that but no cigar. I realised Show Off listening mode was disabled, when enabled the option returned. Thanks all for your help."
2024-10-03,"I honestly don't find it great. It's not consistent enough to rely on it. Sometimes the music starts up if there's a gap in the talking, and then I miss some of what the person is saying.

If I'm in a conversation situation it's far better to just stop the music."
2024-10-03,"You can pay it off however you‚Äôd like. Instead of paying $250 right now, I can pay $100 now, $100 2 weeks later, and the rest another 2 weeks. It‚Äôs about being flexible."
2024-10-02,Yea let‚Äôs chalk it up to us financing things and not the shit economy‚Ä¶ thanks..
2024-10-03,"I totally agree it could be better. What you said happens to me all the time, where it comes back up too soon and then i miss what the other person says."
2024-10-02,"Let's chalk it up to a mix of lack of personal discipline and a crap economy, which I very specifically mentioned."
2024-10-03,And do you use it that way? I'd feel too awkward if I had to ask them multiple times to repeat themselves lol
2024-10-02,"Us financing isn‚Äôt going to kill us.. many of us have successfully done it, and if we have the means, let us be. Thanks. You can do whatever you like, that‚Äôs why we have our own free will."
2024-10-03,"I‚Äôve managed around it. If i‚Äôm going to have a longer conversation i‚Äôll just pause music and go transparency, but if it‚Äôs a quick hello or something it works just fine."
2024-10-02,I can see I must have been part of the few of this  generation who paid attention in Economics and Finance classes....
2024-10-02,"Okay? They one phased that out of school and made it an elective, or at least here in my state it is not required. And two, we don‚Äôt want to run our lives exactly the way you do."
2024-10-02,Good luck in life. Wish you the best.
2024-10-02,"Thanks. Thats just it, I get to live my life the way I want, and you get to live yours the way you want."
2023-12-19,"Same here, i love them so much but as the guy said there‚Äôs better earbuds that have almost the same sound or even better than the airpods, although they don‚Äôt come with the same accessibility that the apple ecosystem has, which is indispensable for me"
2023-12-19,For me AirPods Pro is the second best product from Apple.
2023-12-20,Underrated feature: pairing them with an Apple TV.
2023-12-19,Apple developed software to make all music sound better. I could explain it but we‚Äôd be hear all day!
2023-12-20,Buy some Apple stocks.  It will pay for a lifetime of future Apple products.
2023-12-19,"I was skeptical at first because the sound is good, but it's not on a par with other premium in-ear phones. BUT they are so bloody comfortable. The first earphones I can wear all day and forget I have them on."
2023-12-20,"I‚Äôve noticed an increase of sound quality as well.  I went through quite a few pairs of OG pros as the noice cancelling just couldn‚Äôt keep up with being on a plane(I travel twice a week).  They would start to do the warble/rattle thing after a month or two and need replacing.   My new 2‚Äôs have lasted much longer and have no issues with planes.  

I have also noticed the sound stage is much more open. I have also heard things in songs and turned my head thinking it was something else and realized it was an element of the song but it sounds like it is coming from way over yonder."
2023-12-19,I also use slight brightness Headphone Accommodations on mine and I personally believe it kicks up the quality yet another notch. Just my op
2023-12-20,"I never had experience ANC before and was life changing because I‚Äôm very sensitive to loud noise. Also, yes, I notice elements in songs that never heard before. So good"
2023-12-20,"I thought they sounded like trash until I did a hearing test with the Mimi app and used the Audiogram to make a custom EQ curve to my hearing. Wow, HUGE difference! They sound fantastic now.

Now if only they would stay in my ears, they would be indispensable."
2023-12-20,Come up for air bro
2023-12-20,omg same here they‚Äôre so fucking good that BASS! damn!
2023-12-20,"So jealous!

I really wish I could get AirPods Pro‚Ä¶. But I‚Äôve never been able to wear headphones that go into the ear canal. I‚Äôve tried smaller tips etc, but they always both hurt and fall out really easily. I think my ear canals are just too small!

I bought the AirPods 2 early last January on sale, but I had to return them since they just kept falling out. I especially loved the multiple touch/click options in the AirPods themselves,  and really wish it was an option on the non-pro shape. ü•≤"
2023-12-20,The only problem with the pro line for me is that they are a bit uncomfortable for my ear shape. Airpod 2 fits perfectly but they are in the verge of being discontinued.
2023-12-20,"Could‚Äôve written this post myself. Also gave my old ones to my mom and she‚Äôs hooked. If I wanted just excellent headphones I‚Äôd probably have gotten something else but that‚Äôs not to say the sound quality isn‚Äôt there, just that I‚Äôd have been shopping differently."
2023-12-20,"I wish they fit my ears, I‚Äôve tried the Pro and the Pro 2 they just fall out when I tilt my head like nearly all silicon tipped headphones for me :(

Regular AirPods fit nice and snug though, I can shake and they don‚Äôt fall out."
2023-12-20,I was just thinking of getting them. So is it really worth the upgrade from AirPods 2nd generation to pro 2 ? Appreciate your comments
2023-12-20,Just the post I was looking for. I‚Äôm getting these for Christmas and I‚Äôm already hyped!
2023-12-20,Yeah for sure I first bought my iPhone last month and got the gen 2 air pods since they didn‚Äôt have pros. Saw some in store and bought them and man do they sound different. Im still getting used to iOS and all these setting but glad I bought these AirPods Pro 2
2023-12-20,"I feel you a bit, I got mine about a week ago and already one of the best purchases I have made in quite some time. The ANC really shuts down the city for me or when I get emotionally caught up at work I‚Äôll throw them on for 10-15 minutes and use it as a way to calm myself or get my energy up for something important or challenging. As others mentioned the accessibility as well is why I went with the Pro 2‚Äôs over Sennheiser or Bose or whomever."
2023-12-20,"AirPods Pro are great, but honestly if I'm spending that amount of money on new wireless earbuds I'm looking somewhere else :( I have an iPhone but I really think the tax for convenience isn't worth compromising what I want most out of an audio device, which is sound.

This isn't to say AirPods sound bad, far from it actually, but there are better ones in that price range."
2023-12-20,"Totally agree plus they are the only in-ears which do not hurt my ear after wearing them for several hours. I‚Äôve tried many and also on-ears, but same applies there for my ears when wearing them too long, but not the Airpods Pro."
2023-12-20,"Agreed. I‚Äôve always had issues with Noise Cancelling and closed type buds causing thumping when walking etc. But these just deals with all that so well and I can actually use them! 

Then adaptive noise cancelling came along and my impressions somehow got even better.

And pairing with AppleTV is awesome, was one of the things that made me change my whole house from Google to Apple home gear.

I‚Äôm loving the walled garden!"
2023-12-20,I used to love them until I upgraded my phone to iOS17. Now I have to pair them every time I get a call. Please fix.
2023-12-20,The gen 2 AirPods Pro were a huge improvement. They undersold how much better they are
2023-12-21,"Recently took a 3 hours flight, sat right next to the wings, 4 babies and kids crying/playing, turned on ANC and was blown away. I had 1st gen airpods pro and recently upgraded to 2nd and wow, love it"
2023-12-22,Dude same here. AirPod pro 2 was the first Apple product I ever bought and the experience I had using them for the first time was one of the most shocking tech experiences I‚Äôve EVER had. I couldn‚Äôt believe how good they were for how small it is.
2023-12-19,I love mine for all the same reasons.
2023-12-20,"Wish I could say the same about mine, bought the pro 2s hoping it would be an upgrade from my old Sony xm3 headphones, i was naive. The mods are clear sure but i get 0 punch. They‚Äôve been sitting on my desk for the past two weeks now."
2023-12-20,"Well, I am glad you like them.

My AirPod Pros won't reliably fit in either ear regardless of what tip I use, and the left microphone is dead after less than 2 years of careful use.

I am not planning on getting another pair."
2023-12-20,Y‚Äôall ears don‚Äôt hurt time to time? my music plays around 70-80 dB but sometimes they hurt my ears not from discomfort just slight headaches
2023-12-20,"Then there‚Äôs me, the non-audiophile who‚Äôs like ‚Äúwoohoo, AirPod gen2 is now only $99!‚Äù ü§£"
2023-12-20,Still using my pros 1 till they break. The only thing I dont like is it switched to usb C. Which is good but I have a shit ton of lighting cables lol and I have the iPhone 14
2023-12-20,"I owned a WF-1000XM3 before and it's so uncomfortable that I couldn't wear them for long despite how great the sound was. Bought an WH-1000XM4 and enjoyed it a lot(still have it to this day) and that's until my last flight that I felt it's too big, too hot and cumbersome to carry around and I think the Airpods Pro 2 will be a better fit in term of convenient since they're so small to keep in your pocket. I finally decided to bought them 3 days ago and it's so comfortable that I could wear them for 2-3 hours and use it to talk with my friends on Discord which is so nice. I used to hate talking while wearing in-ear headphones because I couldn't hear myself properly but Airpods Pro 2 just eliminated all those. They're so good!!  


In term of sound quality, they're defo not the best sounding earbuds and don't have any 'wow' factor tome but they're more than good enough for me to enjoy all music genres.  


P.S. I was once into audiophile stuff too and decided that to me, convenient is everything."
2023-12-20,The convenience they offer is so unnerving. I remember being so excited to get the 2nd gens when they got announced. Can't wait for gen 3. It's weird not even a new iPhone or the mixed reality headset excited me as much
2023-12-20,If you are into movies get the apple tv box. Being able to watch shows and movies with all the airpod features is fucking insane.
2023-12-20,"I was listening to cheap soundcore ear buds the other day, and I would say that they sound almost the same for me."
2023-12-20,"I like my AirPods Pro alright, but for the ecosystem convenience. I don‚Äôt think the audio quality is much to talk about. Bass??? Any IEM will run circles around the AirPods - pros or not.. for bass (my old Audeze iSine10s do these, and they‚Äôre not particularly strong on the bass)
The new Creative xMEMS or the Nura/Denon TWS headphones are significantly better in audio quality with ANC included"
2023-12-20,I really would love to use the pros but the one on my left ear is always falling out :(
2023-12-20,"You should try the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, you'd be surprised haha. ANC & Transparency is slightly better on the Airpods but sound wise the Galaxy's are a step up. Better instrument separation and layering along with a wider sound stage. They also have a cleaner frequency response, though tuning is also subjective, it sounds cleaner than the Airpods. Resolution and details are fairly similar but because of the better separation it sounds a bit more detailed. Comfort is a toss up since it depends on the individual's ears. Samsung owns Harmon & AKG so they know how to do audio well. The Airpods have improved their sound quality by a step though, even if it's a very mass consumer centric type of sound."
2023-12-20,"I have the AirPods Pro 2 too and I love them but because of convenience, integration in the ecosystem and the just fine audio quality. When I truly want to listen to the music I use my Bose, an actual headset and a totally different story."
2023-12-20,the more I see this type of post the more I want to buy them despite of enjoying the AP3
2023-12-20,AirPods are awesome!
2023-12-20,"The thing is sound quality is relative, I used to think airpods sound quality is amazing until I listened to some audiophile grade headphones ever since that my perspective has totally changed and airpods sound stage seems tiny, 
I would suggest you not listening to any higher grade audiophile equipment to keep enjoying airpods."
2023-12-20,"I love the easy pairing and magical switching between mac and iPhone, sure there‚Äôs better ones out there st the same price but the convenience or an AirPod is unmatched"
2023-12-20,"I love mine, use them for gaming too. They‚Äôre incredible.

Sound quality wise they‚Äôre about on par with $80-100 IEMs but the convenience is insane.

I commute by bike and it‚Äôs so nice to be able to control my music, or send a text with Siri."
2023-12-20,"I got my AirPod pros at the end of 2019, thinking they‚Äôd only last a year or 2.

4 years later they are kicking and going strong. The noise cancellation is starting to struggle when I‚Äôm on the tube , but except that absolutely no issues. Even battery life is still great all things considered"
2023-12-20,"Mine are being repaired and i realized, i'm no kidding addicted to them. That's how good they are"
2023-12-20,I bought mine recently and no complaints (:
2023-12-20,I just wish the microphones didn't become actual garbage when using them on my Windows PC.
2023-12-20,I have the original pros. Should I get the new ones?
2023-12-20,IEMs would blow your mind lol
2023-12-20,Wish the one in my right ear fit.  And flies out if chewing gum or working out.  All the sizes seem to not fit.  :(
2023-12-20,I‚Äôd buy your AirPod pro 1‚Äôs if you‚Äôd like to recoup some of the cost to upgrade. DM me if so. I just lost mine..
2023-12-20,"Well, I mean, that's the goal. If they weren't better, Apple wouldn't make nearly as much money as they'd want. There's also a lot of competition similarly priced outside of Apple that is on par or exceeds the airpods' quality, so there's nothing too insane about them."
2023-12-20,The best is Volume Control by clicking/swiping up and down on the speakers themselves!
2023-12-21,"Completely agree about my APP1. I've been looking for replacements because of battery being already on the short side (4h) and lack of multipoint connection outside of the ecosystem.             
                  
I've tried many earbuds since then and I always end up returning them and going back to the AirPods Pro. Case size, comfort, call quality, ANC, transparency, controls and sound quality. No other earbud gets all these right the way APP does it for me."
2023-12-21,Now wait until you try real headphones with a proper DAC and your head will explode
2023-12-23,they‚Äôre really that much better than the regular pros? I‚Äôve had my regular ones since july 2022 but i‚Äôve been thinking of upgrading just for the speaker in the case to ping them
2023-12-24,I sleep every night with it in listening to nothing. Just sound cancelling
2024-04-10,"To be honest i found airpods pro 2 being lackluster... Kind of meh, and this is me as a normal consumer not even acoustic engineer.

Google pixel buds pro were kinds nice but was not able to go louder.

To be honest, new beats tuning on measurement rig is better than apple airpods pro 2

*Meanwhile me rocking a Fiio BTR15 and kiwi ears quintet proaudiophile in ear monitor with balanced kekble so take my opinions as a grain of salt*"
2024-09-24,"They're expensive but, dang, they're good... Maybe not the best sound, but it's up there, and the features and fit, makes it a complet and awesome package.. great work by Apple..."
2024-12-16,I‚Äôm using them WAY more than I thought I would.  Like walking around outside with them on half the day.  I never thought I‚Äôd do that.
2023-12-20,"I have the very opposite opinion. I can‚Äôt use it for online meetings because as I talk they started falling off, can‚Äôt take to he gym because as I pull and push and make weird faces they fall off.


I regret the purchase, the original AirPods though fitted me perfectly."
2023-12-20,The sony wf-1000xm5 are a step up from the airpods 2 in everyway
2023-12-20,I own both airpods pro 2 and galaxy buds pro 1.You will be more surprised how the samsung one will absolutely make airpods pro 2 sound ehhh
2023-12-19,Love just about everything but I would still love an eq. Had a good preset on my now returned xm5s that had high bass and clear sounds.
2023-12-20,"I agree with everything besides the sound, they sound the same as the ones before"
2023-12-21,"Nice try, Tim."
2023-12-22,They do it the same way so many other companies do it. Nothing revolutionary about it lol.
2023-12-23,Weird Advertisement
2023-12-20,Hi Apple marketing!
2023-12-20,Returning mine after 3 days. Fabulous piece of technology that are absolutely unbearably painful to wear in my ears. Too bad‚Ä¶
2023-12-20,I don‚Äôt know why but I honestly just haven‚Äôt noticed a big sound quality difference between 1& 2 personally
2023-12-20,"Dude it ain‚Äôt that deep, they are just headphones lmao"
2023-12-20,AirPods are terrible sound quality. Have a listen to some hi res flac files with iem‚Äùs on a dac
2023-12-19,Nice try Apple marketing team
2023-12-19,"Happy for you, I find them pretty uncomfortable and sound quality not so great."
2023-12-20,"I just bought a new pair of AirPods 3. I just saw a deal at Costco for the Pro 2s, only $40 more.  Debating on getting them"
2023-12-20,Take it easy buddy don‚Äôt cum in your pants!
2023-12-20,"Yes they are cool

But think about how much intentional planning goes into making a old gen model shittier while the new one looks good and later will become degraded with firmware updates, it's all gonna be sooooo obsolete in 10 years

I'm losing my admiration for the tech industry tbh if things would only last"
2023-12-19,I'm curious which ones do you find have better sound?
2024-12-04,what accessibility are you referring to?  I ordered these for black friday and would like your experience to know what im getting myself into
2023-12-19,"Funny enough if the AirPods product was its own company, it‚Äôd be one of the biggest companies in the world."
2023-12-19,What's first? :D
2023-12-20,What‚Äôs your favorite Apple product?
2023-12-20,correct
2023-12-20,"Underrated purchase: they first should have an Apple TV üòÜ

Btw, yes the best combo to have great home theatre like experience."
2023-12-20,I‚Äôve never tried with my Apple TV! Thanks for the update!
2023-12-20,One of the reasons I bought an Apple TV
2023-12-20,What about pairing them to a Samsung tv? Will the quality be great too
2023-12-20,It really is the way to go.
2023-12-20,Can you pair first gen AirPod pro to Apple TV too? Or just 2nd gen?
2023-12-21,"You can pair them with most Rokus too, if you are not an Apple TV owner."
2023-12-20,‚ÄúHear‚Äù. Get it?
2023-12-20,I‚Äôve got all day
2023-12-20,Yeah but expensive are they these days? Should have done it in the 90s!
2023-12-19,"Huh, yeah I should try out more premium headphones then, guess I never really tried them before, I have Hyper X Cloud 2 and AirPods Pro, and had some Sennheisers in ear before  
I was curious if Apple Pro Max are good but the price is a bit bity, but wondering what are other great options? Marhals?"
2023-12-20,I took a nap with them in and when I woke up and walked away I remembered I was wearing them and thought I'd dropped them somewhere. They were still in my ears and I didn't even realize
2023-12-19,"Damn there's even more config around them, didn't even know, I'll check it out! :)"
2023-12-20,What is ‚Äúslight brightness Headphone Accommodations‚Äù?
2023-12-20,I did the audio test and imported it into Health‚Ä¶ now what? How do I use it to make an EQ?
2023-12-20,üòπ
2024-12-16,"I was never able to get buds that stayed in, but the large air pod pro tip seals my canal perfectly and has been a game changer for me with ANC.  Love these way more than I thought I would."
2023-12-20,Why on the verge of being discontinued?
2023-12-20,Same for me. Went back to regular airpods 3. gen. I really miss ANC but they wouldnt stay in my ears at all.
2024-12-16,"Agree about this.  The noise cancellation works awesome when walking in a busy downtown street or mall, especially with something relaxing playing.  Totally changes my mood."
2024-10-26,What do you use instead?
2023-12-20,Same here. I'm still questioning as of why it's different to other in-ears.
2024-12-16,With noise cancellation on you don‚Äôt have to blast the music to hear all the nuances.
2023-12-20,"Haven't noticed yet, but they also feel much louder, I have to keep them at 2-3 points lower than max volume, since it just feels too loud  
With Pro I just had it on full volume most of the time"
2023-12-20,"I have exact same story. I had 1000XM3 from work for a couple of months. The sound and noise cancelling was great, but I just hated wearing them for long and carrying them.. they're just too bulky. I also think they had a shitty way of telling you the battery is low with beep every X seconds or something.. bleh  
  
So for me not feeling I wear it and being able to easily have them for a day was a game changer. That's why convenience is much more important to me that quality here"
2023-12-20,"Thank you for your recommendation, I hope they'll have them in a mall when I visit next time so I can try them if it's possible"
2023-12-20,"Hey, at least you connected yours.. mine still displays 2 connections: 1 for AirPods audio out, and 1 for microphone on them  
I hate Windows so much for that, for not pairing simple devices properly.. how hard is that to do, but hey, even their Photos app is crashing often, so I don't know what I expect"
2023-12-20,"To be honest, I loved my original Pros, and I would be definitely fine with them, they're an amazing product  
I'd advice going to a mall and checking them out if you have that option, and play some of your favorite songs you often listen to on them, and you'll notice the difference immediately  
If you think after that it's worth the price then go for it, otherwise I would be alright with the first Pros really, just wanted to make my mom a bit happier with ANC headphones"
2023-12-20,"what are those prices, jeeezuz  
I'm just listening to Spotify, I don't know if the quality would be that much different in those, but I am curious to just try it out to see what is the deal with them, hehe"
2023-12-20,"Sending them to my Mom, sorry mate. She needs a bit of peace of mind at home to not be bothered, so ANC would save her sanity a bit I hope"
2023-12-20,"Yeah I'm yet to experience that. I had exactly the same experience with AirPods Pro. And both of them are on the same size of the earpiece (L), so I'm expecting that will probably happen again :("
2023-12-20,"Same here, they don‚Äôt fit my ear at all which is a shame cuz I prefer them. No matter the tip size or how hard I shove them in, they just fall right out when I tilt my head.

Regular AirPods shape works great for me though, I can shake and they don‚Äôt fall out."
2023-12-20,Comply foams took care of that for me.
2023-12-20,"Never had those problems, it‚Äôs perfect for my gym sessions"
2023-12-20,all just depends on your ear shape. the pros fit great for me but i can‚Äôt wear the originals or the 3‚Äôs.
2023-12-20,"How's the transparency mode on those?  
Transparency on APP2 is by far the best I've ever tried."
2023-12-20,The best headphones on the market vs a pair of earbuds seems a bit unfair to compare with
2023-12-20,"Interesting, I wanna check them out. I don't know about form factor, but curios about the sound"
2023-12-19,There is a way. Upload a random photo as an audiogram in accessibility then it will let you edit the eq.  Got mine sounding incredible.
2023-12-23,"It's okay, maybe one day you'll finally find something to be happy about in life as well :D"
2023-12-20,Just wait it gets better after a few days
2023-12-20,"Dude it's just someone happy about something in their life, you don't have to be stupid about it and bring them down lmao"
2023-12-20,"While you‚Äôre correct, and AirPods don‚Äôt do lossless 

they sound amazing for any average music listener and that‚Äôs the majority of Apple fans"
2023-12-20,"lol there's always that guy in every forum

  
No shit, $200 wireless earbuds don't sound as good as wired IEMs on a proper DAC?"
2023-12-20,No shit Sherlock‚Ä¶ you are comparing different products. Of course iems on a DAC and hi res files sound better but they are impractical for everyday use.
2023-12-20,"Can you bring those 'system' everywhere and not look weird? Like chilling in a coffee shop, waiting for an airplane or a bus, casual and quick listening to that new album while in a workplace?   


It's great and all but it's not as convenient and not able to fit in my pocket."
2023-12-21,"While you all make valid points regarding dac and iem portability, the b&o E8s blow the AirPods out of the water, Bluetooth, same price. So back to my original point, AirPods are terrible sound quality"
2023-12-19,you don't like them?
2023-12-19,"huh, what did you not like about the sound?"
2023-12-19,They never fit in my ears. Always slip out
2023-12-20,"For me Beats Fit Pro are definitely better in sound quality, more clean and more balanced with better bass response but sound is something personal. Apple has a conservative approach, Beats has a coloured approach."
2023-12-20,"I think Sony's flagships--most recently the WF-1000XM5s--have slightly better sound, but imo the airpods make up for it in other ways (mic on the Sony's is trash, I had some issues with mine cutting out, among a few other slight grievances). Apple knocked it out of the park with these"
2023-12-20,Wait til you squeeze the stem and try transparency/active noise cancellation bro I sleep with them on sometimes with noice cancellation on as ear plugs
2023-12-20,"B&W PI7, B&O E8"
2023-12-20,"I'd say my Bose QCs were better sound quality and noise cancellation, however, I do find I prefer the fit and finish of APP2s."
2023-12-21,B&W Pi7 S2 sound quite a bit better but have a lot of inconveniences.
2023-12-19,"Have you tried the Beats Fits Pro, I‚Äôm deciding on either those or the AirPod Pros 2"
2023-12-20,Beoplays ex's sound miles better. But I still daily my pros because of the ecosystem.
2023-12-20,Bose qc2 earbuds have superior sound and anc but their software is soooo bad. Complete ass.
2023-12-19,Indeed.
2023-12-19,The iPhone.
2023-12-20,But do you still get Spatial Audio if you pair with a Samsung tv?
2023-12-20,"It works well with a Samsung TV, but some features, such as auto pause when you remove an earbud and spatial audio, don‚Äôt work"
2023-12-20,You can connect any AirPods to the Apple TV. Was doing it with my first AirPods before I upgraded to the pro 2
2023-12-20,We hear for you.
2023-12-20,He doesn‚Äôt
2023-12-20,"Said some guy back in 2000, and some other guy back in 2010, and some other guy in 2020. And they all regret not buying."
2023-12-20,This won‚Äôt age well tbf
2025-01-08,"Apple has gone up 30% since this comment was made. For all future people to come across this post, let the lesson be nothing is too expensive in the stock market. Stocks only go up."
2023-12-20,"depends if you‚Äôre looking for headphones or in ears. i don‚Äôt know much about in ears but the beyerdynamic dt series are great headphones, easily studio quality, for under 200 usd."
2023-12-20,"Marshalls are landfill.

Depends on what youre looking for and budget but for wireless headphones focal bathys are probably the best there is (purely sound quality).

Wired headphones for pc i would recomend: 

sennheiser 6xx, (extremely good for vocals, pretty warm intimate sound, not alot of bass)

Hifiman sundara, (has a completely different way of creating sound than most headphones, which gives them a pretty unique sound if youve never heard magnetostatic headphones before )

Beyerdynamics dt900 pro x should be a bit more vshaped sound"
2023-12-20,Boosts the highs slightly

2023-12-20,Rumors that they might discontinue 2nd gen when they announce gen 4.
2023-12-20,Thanks
2023-12-20,"It‚Äôs not so much the quality as it is the detail in your music. The resolution(quality) can definitely be better depending on the IEM but the main things are the technical aspects of the music such as imaging or instrument separation and they can make vocals and instruments sound incredible depending on the tuning and technical performance of course. 

There‚Äôs IEMs that are the same price as the Airpods that sound like $500 headphones

There‚Äôs also $50-100 IEMs that sound as good if not better then the airpods"
2023-12-20,That‚Äôs wild. The regular AirPods felt like they were constantly falling. Tbh the pros don‚Äôt feel like they aren‚Äôt there but they don‚Äôt feel like constantly falling out
2023-12-20,"WF-1000XM5 are also earbuds. WH-1000XM5 are the headphones.

2023-12-23,"lol sorry, the tone of the post and comments were so overly positive they looked like bots. I am glad you are enjoying your headphones, how does the sound compare to other models you‚Äôve tried?"
2023-12-20,Uuugh‚Ä¶ I dunno. I already packed them away & got a return shipping label. Going to try AirPods Max. Even though I think I‚Äôll loath travelling with such a bulky headset‚Ä¶
2023-12-24,"Update: it got better. I switched back to the larger rubbers & the pain went away! Weirdly, they still fall out easier than my AirPod2s & when I pull them out intentionally, the rubbers flip themselves inside out. But so far the spacial audio / super hearing features are worth it!"
2023-12-21,"However I will back up a bit,
Obviously I own the app2 to have such an opinion, I take my dac and iems majority of the time to the office and commute (ifi zendac is smaller than a zippo) I do take the AirPods occasionally for calls and maps when I know I‚Äôll be busy, the tech is amazing and second to none. But the sound quality IS compromised. I don‚Äôt think everyone should ditch their pods, just have a listen to a similar priced audiophile grade earbud before throwing your praise at the AirPods"
2023-12-19,Not enough to write five paragraphs fellating the company
2023-12-20,Apple owns Beats...?
2023-12-20,Better than the APP2 sound wise?
2023-12-20,Ap pro 2 kept falling from my ears. Switched to beats fit pro and they work like a charm.
2023-12-20,"I have Beats Fit Pro, and I would never ever say they are better than AirPods! I was comparing them with my husband's AirPods Pro, and the sound in his was incredible while in the Fits, there is something off with a certain spectrum of tones. I mean I like them but to me they are only good for watching films, YT etc. I'm getting AirPods Max for Christmas now, and my husband the Pros 2, so I will have a chance to compare them all."
2023-12-20,"I currently have the WF XM4s and am fighting with sony to get them replaced/reimbursed while out of warranty. I got hit by the uneven battery drain just a few weeks ago and looking at the web this seems to be a thing with the XM4s...

The thing with the Sony Buds is, you won't get any better sound out of them compared to the apple pro 2 ones. You can't use LDAC with iPhones out of the box and the fit is not as good as the apple ones.

Depending on what Sony tries on me, this might be my last Sony product outside of the Playstation space.

I would never again recommend the sony buds to anyone. Looking at the Link Buds S, the same is happening too and people post pictures of burst-open buds on r/sony or r/SonyHeadphones

There's big battery issue thread pinned on r/SonyHeadphones

Last but not least, integration into apples ecosystem is far better on their own pods, understandable."
2023-12-20,I tried the wf-1000xm5‚Äôs .. good sound quality but they did not connect via lcad? .. ( Sony‚Äôs Bluetooth codex ) to SONY‚Äôs top dap player I‚Äôve had about 8 years .. you would think Sony would make sure they play with their own Bluetooth players ..sent them back ‚Ä¶
2023-12-20,"This, I had the xm3 before and although they sounded much better than the AirPods Pro 1 at the time, + the battery was much better, they lost on everything else.

Cluncky, connection issues (both on android and iOS), app wasn‚Äôt great, the touch button was annoying, fit issues, ear pain after a while using etc

AirPods Pro strike a perfect balance between sound quality and usability"
2024-05-13,"Same thing. If I‚Äôm on a plane and really want to have the better sound quality, I‚Äôll go with the Sonys. But it‚Äôs ever so slightly better, and that‚Äôs because I will use the wired connection option which makes the bass hit harder and tighter (very very important to me). 

When I‚Äôm in the office at my desk, having a single AirPod on is by far the way to go. 

At the end of the day, people don‚Äôt want to admit they‚Äôre that good. I have a 20k 2 channel setup at home. 30k if you include my turntable which I won‚Äôt since I‚Äôm comparing digital. My main system is admittedly better, but cost literally 100x as much. But honestly I sometimes am blown away with what the AirPods offer. 

I also have a pair of Sony Sony IER-M9s, and they don‚Äôt impress me enough to reach for them over the AirPods. Inconvenient, and the bass doesn‚Äôt have the impact. Call it ‚Äúbetter balance‚Äù in the Sonys, IDC. The Sonys are $900 and not wireless. The AirPods are $200 now and offer 90% of the quality for 20% of the price."
2023-12-20,"That's what I also heard MKBHD say, where he thinks it's probably great for concerts, because it keeps the sound signature, but lowers the volume. If that's true it will be a game changer just for that. I hate wearing ear plugs and not hearing the music or crowd well"
2023-12-20,">Das habe ich auch von MKBHD geh√∂rt, wo er denkt, dass es wahrscheinlich gro√üartig f√ºr Konzerte ist, weil es die Klangsignatur beibeh√§lt, aber die Lautst√§rke senkt. Wenn das wahr ist, wird es allein daf√ºr ein Game Changer sein. Ich hasse es, Ohrst√∂psel zu tragen und die Musik oder das Publikum nicht gut zu h√∂ren

Same here üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I'm so used to it now that I fall asleep every night with the AirPods in my ear. Noise cancellation on and just fall asleep."
2023-12-24,"While i appreciate Crin‚Äôs reviews, he really dropped the ball with the APP2 review. He reviewed them on an‚Ä¶ Android phone :-(. You NEED an iPhone to activate the Balanced tone from within its settings. That way, they sound FANTASTIC. I‚Äôd say better than the Buds 2 Pro. I am simply amazed by how convenient they are, on top of their sound. And this comes from someone who has HD800S, HD820, HE1000se, IE 900 as headphones/IEMs."
2023-12-19,"If you‚Äôre just listening to music, get the beats. If you want an all around experience, get the app2‚Äôs. They still sound good with music and the battery life is better, I also leave mine in all day in transparency while I‚Äôm at work which is nice"
2023-12-20,"yes, it‚Äôs a pity - Bose QC2 fit great in ears, but permanent connection issues are such a nuisance."
2023-12-20,Faire
2024-12-05,would you say 3rd is ipad?
2023-12-20,"No, Spatial Audio isn't supported on Samsung TVs"
2023-12-20,Thank you so much for a descriptive response üòÄ
2023-12-20,"Just dropping by to say the Hifiman Sundaras are ""Planar Magnetic"" earphones, not magnetostatic!"
2023-12-20,How do you activate this feature?
2023-12-20,"I'll check them out, thank you for your recommendation and thoughts!"
2023-12-23,"haha, alright, I'm just making fun of people that seemingly hate on it for funs  
honestly, I didn't try a lot of different versions, and I am bit of mindless Apple consumer, but I do love so many products that I find it hard to try other products  
I've had Sony's WX3000 before, they had amazing sound, but just too bulky. In my case I'd prefer convenience and small size over over the ear one, so I'm happy. But I also learned a lot of great brands I wrote down to try from the wonderful comments here, like Galaxy Buds 2 and others  
  
Honestly, I still can't get used to how much the quality updated, and today I slept for 4 hours in them cus of annoying neighbor fucks. 10/10"
2023-12-19,"so you're actively subscribed to a whole subreddit dedicated to airpods, and you don't like it when others enjoy something, got it"
2023-12-20,Yep. Where have you been for almost the last 10 years?
2023-12-20,It's how we got the current Apple Music streaming service.
2023-12-21,Dre became a billionaire from that deal.
2023-12-20,Sound wise they‚Äôre pretty comparable. The noise cancellation is better in app2.
2023-12-20,"there‚Äôs a ton of earbuds that are better as far as sound quality goes, but the comparability with iphones is so nice"
2023-12-20,Sounds like you need comply tips
2023-12-20,"As I've said, sound and most of all the perception of the sound is something personal..."
2023-12-21,"are you outside of the USA? My experience was completely different. All I had to do was go to live chat and tell them i want to make a warranty claim (even though mine are out of warranty, bought nov 2021). I told them straight up it had to do with the battery firmware issue, the right bud was dying in 15 min while left was normal, and they immediately gave me the option of sending them in for repair or sending them back for a full refund. They didn‚Äôt even ask me about the warranty period or verify if they were still in warranty at all. 

i‚Äôve never had to make a claim before now, but this experience has actually increased my respect for sony as a company. they stand by their products and have usually have stellar customer service. i have sony wired IEMs, an OLED 4k TV, and had a PS5 in the past and in spite of the wf xm4s being defective, i would not hesitate to consider buying sony products in the future. 

of course i opted for the full refund LOL and immediately went out and bought airpod pro 2s. i would still recommend sony wireless earbuds to buyers, the sound quality on both is great but slightly better on the sonys vs the pros (just by a little). apple ecosystem integration is just so good though. and adaptive sound mode is fucking insane !!!"

2023-12-20,Same issues with uneven battery drain
2023-12-20,Best thing I ever took to a concert! Saved me from ringing ears and I still enjoyed the live music.
2023-12-20,I also really like the physical buttons on the beats.
2023-12-20,"What‚Äôs the battery life with just transparency on? 

My main frustration with my AirPods is that they don‚Äôt last through the workday, usually can‚Äôt even make it through the morning, but I also know they aren‚Äôt designed to. Ideally I need two pairs."
2023-12-20,*We* are him
2023-12-23,"VOO(ytd +23%), VGT(ytd +50%), and FXIAX(ytd +25%) are one of the most popular index funds out there and all 3 has apple carrying the most weight in its portfolio. 

Basically anyone with a 401k or Roth are investing in Apple"
2023-12-20,No problem :)
2023-12-20,It‚Äôs in accessibility > audio/visual but I do not recommend it
2023-12-21,I knew Apple owns Beats. AAPL is my largest holding. I was responding (obviously not very well) to above post. I do believe that Apple is sharing technology across engineers from both product lines so I'm not sure there is much diff between them. But I could be wrong as I've never used a beats product. No need as I live AirPod Pros

2023-12-21,"I'm from germany and there is no chat available. I called a few times and wrote mails. The last support agent actually tried to help me instead of rerouting me to the stupid support website. I am currently waiting for a response but my case number exists but i cannot open the status of it...

Absolute chaos"
2023-12-23,"Had nearly the exact same experience. Loved my Sonys until the battery issue. They took my claim no questions asked really and gave full refund. 

I took the refund and bought AirPods Pro 2. No regrets. 

I think Sony audio quality is actually better and more customizable, but apple integration and transparency mode are so legit. Makes up for the difference in sound quality. Also after a few hours of wear the Sonys would kind of strain my ears but not the AirPods. Barely feel them in most of the time."
2023-12-20,Are you talking about the xm4s or apple airpods pro 2?
2023-12-20,Did it actually work for you? Was it lower volume but clear sound?
2023-12-25,"While i generally agree with your statement, i also think that in Apple's case, at least, given their tight integration, one should consider reviewing their products withing their own ecosystem. Likewise, it's how A LOT of people apply EQ to their 'phones so they can get better sound and that's why some reviewers mark a certain product by x/10 without EQ and y/10 with EQ.

&#x200B;

It's the same case with the much praised Sennheiser HD800. They were unanimously criticized for being overly-bright and fatiguing and people turned to EQ and mods. After that, though, everyone praised them and held them in high regard. It's kinda the same thing with the APP2.  

&#x200B;

Given my reasoning from above, would it be fair for me to assert that the HD800 are BAD headphones? No, they have bad stock tuning, that's it."
2023-12-20,"I get 4-5 hours. They only take 20-30 minutes to charge. I have 2 sets but I just keep one set at work and one at home. There‚Äôs always a few minutes here and there I can charge them real quick. That‚Äôs probably my favorite part about them is the charging speed lol. I‚Äôm never consistently listening for hours without having 10 or 15 minutes where I can‚Äôt throw them in the case real quick. My lightening set seem to last longer than my usbc pair. Could be settings or something, I‚Äôm not sure. And if you‚Äôre not using transparency, they‚Äôll last longer"
2023-12-19,"Except you didn't have an opinion, you're just being a douche in your second comment now, first about me fellating them, and now calling me names  
Enjoy your ban you ignorant bafoon"

2023-12-26,sorry you had a bad experience :( i guess sony customer support isn‚Äôt as good outside of japan and the US
2023-12-20,I would assume xm4s. I have the same exact problem with mine. A few months ago after an update the left one would just drop from fully charged down to 10% and within minutes it would die completely. It‚Äôs made me not wanting to get another pair of Sony earphones and just go with AirPods anyway now that I have an iPhone (my first!).
2023-12-20,"I have sensory issues with crowds/loud noises.  I went to a music festival this summer and I would wear my Pros in Transparency mode whenever I went to the stage.  It worked great, sounded good and whenever I checked with the noise app on my watch the Pros wear working as hard as they could to keep the noise to 85 db."
2023-12-20,"I use my XM5s for this purpose and it's, fantastic. Sometimes the sound quality degrades at very loud volumes (race car events) but I feel it's well worth it."
2023-12-20,I don‚Äôt use transparency but I‚Äôm on phone calls sometimes for 8+ hours a day sometimes without breaks. They probably can make it through 3 hours consistently.
2023-12-19,Lol go write up some more Ads you loser

2023-12-26,It's terrible up until now.
2023-12-20,"I see. 
I feared that the apple air pods pro 2 have the same issue, hence my question. I am still trying to get Sony to reimburse me to get something non-Sony."
2023-12-20,reimburse idk but i had the xm4's and was able to get a replacement pair after the warranty expired through sony customer support so I'll chalk that up as a W
2023-12-20,I have heard from people that there might be issues with replacement parts and that they got reimbursed instead. I'd be happy with a repair too üòâ
